Just thinking, how shocked and ecstatic Einstein would have gotten if he was alive to truly witness the discovery of black holes. Especially when they regarded it as not realistic even when the math worked out

Really now? You speak about science (theory, experiment, proof) while all you do is theory and visualizations.
If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>‚ÄúThe greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚ÜìŒ± is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?
Amazing
My bad
Oh
Enjoyable
20 dishes? That&#39;s a lot of washing up.
Congratulations üî≠ü™ê‚ú®
And when i started thinking and seeeing SCIENCE  related VIDEOS then  i don&#39;t see time . <br>I forget everything infront of this .
Physics is just amazing so so Amazing Every time when i think about physics,it blows up my mind This universe is so mysterious  really.
I&#39;m more convinced with Andrea Ghez data than his subjective impression of the radio data even though he obviously wants to take the credit of discovering black holes in galaxies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=923">15:23</a> No high speed internet on the planet beats out a 747 filled with hard drives?? Scuse me?
Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Brian Greene is a Genius!
Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!üëèüëèüëè<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.
An Object Falls Due To Said Object Being More Dense Than The Space Around It. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH, &quot;Gravity&quot; üòÜ
&quot;Gravity&quot; Is A THEORY And Does... Not... Exist. You&#39;re Welcome.
Love that he wears a pin with the image of the black hole on
Boring
If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! üëè
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name
Not a  pic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=660">11:00</a>
The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I‚Äôd give you one thousand dishes. Brian‚Äôs a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.
Omg even Greene is saying that new habit people are doing in spoken language‚Ä¶. ‚Äòright?‚Äù After every four words
I miss the discussion panel though üò¢
Essentially, he simulated a Solar Eclipse on a Black Hole instead of the Sun in order to get a picture of itü§ì
Fantastic lecture and looking forward to the next discoveries maybe to be developed to better and peaceful species !
How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind
Hahaha black holes üï≥
Fucking Democrats ruined World Science Festival by banning live audience.
Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?
Black holes don&#39;t exist
What if we are a experiment by advanced human civilization that set us out here to see how we would advance or how long it would take us to figure out the universe
I love living in these awakening times where technology has overtaken the lies we‚Äôve been indoctrinated with! which has closed most peoples minds ‚ô•Ô∏èüòé<br>The legendary Nikon P 900 camera with phenomenal zoom shows us why that little star twinkle twinkles and so much more but look on YouTube for ‚Äò Mars Nikon P 900‚Äò and realise fElony Musk can‚Äôt shoot his load to a luminary in our sky! <br>Betelgeuse Nikon P 900 is a strange one but have a look for any light in the sky like Saturn with what looks like it could have a total ring around it which our minds perceive to be true üòâ<br>If the lights we see are just that then the rest of the supposed universe is up for debate üòÜ<br>Black holes? Nah!
Not only is the guest intelligent but so is the host!
The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different
I can&#39;t believe I sat through an hour interview about a blurry blackhole picture, and enjoyed every moment of it.
Please share with other people my two brief videos. Thanks!!
Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.

That&#39;s not an actual picture of our black hole now is it it&#39;s computer rendition of it isn&#39;t it
So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right
Believe I am &quot;black holed&quot; out.  Next topic. ; maybe how to get from a to b w/o getting shot by a felon they just caught and released two minutes ago.  Defund the Democrats  and save the world.
Okay that explains those black holes but how do you get a device IP address into a black hole device status how does that happen this is a real question
What is the first thing they say about a black hole? Answer not even light can escape the gravity of a black hole!!! They are conducting themselves again!!!

Want to see them at kids scales since there a magnetic strand to mass you can see them with magnet iron or new neodymium if you split them there bind by a atomic particle line if you watch on YouTube or if you have the material you may see the very centre and on old bar magnet if you get the iron fine and just right from the top poles out you can see the second hole and at the very centre a small bend at the very centre I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like a transformer air gap or impurities at the join but I&#39;ve repeated this with new N42 neodymium and a rubber to hold them apart the magnetic field interaction with the fabric feild interact if you get it just right also showing a gauze line to the material magnet and a bind at the centre you can check there safe!.

I don&#39;t know about you but I find it very exciting to think of what&#39;s to come in the future; close-up photos, videos, more data on size, etc ! The only painful thing is that I won&#39;t be here to see most of all of that. Mortality really sucks the big one sometimes !
I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.
Enjoyed that largely because I could understand it, and that is down to the language employed and the presentation ,an absolutely fantastic show.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus. I also believe they know this and plan on jumping because they know earth will move out the goldilocks zone and Venus in. Yea I know it&#39;s crazy but adds up. Call me Noah ü§£
How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.
If we use Newton&#39;s language and time is only a parameter, how close can we describe the unescapable force of the event horizon? <br><br>We don&#39;t have space turning to time, instead we need to assume what? Do things just disappear from the universe disobeying thermodynamics, or is it just fuzzy-math-really-really-super-strong?
Is there some way to see those four different renders that each team came up with, for m87?
A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking‚Ä¶ once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can‚Äôt control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can‚Äôt control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you‚Äôre still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there‚Äôs a gravity-like force that‚Äôs infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can‚Äôt stay in any one moment in time and can‚Äôt move through time‚Ä¶ Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.  But I seem to remember that there was a threshold size that when reached would initiate the beginning of a black hole&#39;s evaporation. Anyway, I would like to see a video about the life span of black holes.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me.

From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.

Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.

@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = Œº/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I love learning that they&#39;ve been able to use data from multiple telescopes across the world to create higher resolution information than any one of the telescopes can alone. Interferometry has been used for many years at the Very Large Array telescope in western New Mexico. I&#39;m happy to hear that similar technology has been expanded to encompass the world. I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

lateral thinkers don&#39;t fit into your sequence. lateral thinkers are important to science and technology and problem solving/progress in general
@@mehridin Absolutely. Although at times I have difficulty explaining my thought process to the majority of linear thinkers (not derogatorily used here) and I notice that it is conversely true too, they have difficulty either understanding or transferring their information to me. My fuzzy logic is difficult to translate, and most of lateral thinkers and visual thinkers have their own version so there is hardly any consistent way to learn or translate. Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to. Occupational hazard of being a lateral/visual thinker.

Cygnus X1 is probably the nearest BH ,about 6000 LY from Earth.
The gravitational pull is proportional to the mass of a given black hole, just like any other stellar bodies.. e.g. if our sun becomes a black hole, which it won&#39;t, the orbits of our planets won&#39;t get affected.

Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
‚àÜ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question üß©
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !

You Cannot have pressurization of a gas next to a vacuum without that gas fully expanding into and filling that available volume due to entropy in an open system as your globe model claims. If &quot;space&quot; were a vacuum, that gas would have been gone and you would have suffocated long ago. We have a gradient. You can Only have a gradient of gas in a closed system, otherwise, yep.. as above, that gas would have to expand into and fill that available volume and you would be dead. We live in a closed system with a gradient because we have pressurization. All experiments prove this via the scientific method. <br><br>Now Mr. after reading this you still think I&#39;m wrong.. go ahead and Prove the globe claims of gas forming a sphere in a vacuum and Earth having air that fails to fully equalize with the vacuum around it via the scientific method. I want you to name the IV, DV, give me the Hypothesis, Null Hypothesis and show me the experiment that validates your hypothesis.

‚ùìrecycles the universe
Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy

Really now? You speak about science (theory, experiment, proof) while all you do is theory and visualizations.
If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>‚ÄúThe greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚ÜìŒ± is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2.

Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>‚ÄúThe equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚Üë‚Üì0Œ± is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?
Amazing

Oh

And when i started thinking and seeeing SCIENCE  related VIDEOS then  i don&#39;t see time . <br>I forget everything infront of this .
Physics is just amazing so so Amazing Every time when i think about physics,it blows up my mind This universe is so mysterious  really.
I&#39;m more convinced with Andrea Ghez data than his subjective impression of the radio data even though he obviously wants to take the credit of discovering black holes in galaxies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=923">15:23</a> No high speed internet on the planet beats out a 747 filled with hard drives?? Scuse me?
Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Brian Greene is a Genius!
Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!üëèüëèüëè<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.
An Object Falls Due To Said Object Being More Dense Than The Space Around It. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH, &quot;Gravity&quot; üòÜ
&quot;Gravity&quot; Is A THEORY And Does... Not... Exist. You&#39;re Welcome.
Love that he wears a pin with the image of the black hole on
Boring
If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! üëè
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name
Not a  pic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=660">11:00</a>
The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I‚Äôd give you one thousand dishes. Brian‚Äôs a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.
Omg even Greene is saying that new habit people are doing in spoken language‚Ä¶. ‚Äòright?‚Äù After every four words
I miss the discussion panel though üò¢
Essentially, he simulated a Solar Eclipse on a Black Hole instead of the Sun in order to get a picture of itü§ì
Fantastic lecture and looking forward to the next discoveries maybe to be developed to better and peaceful species !
How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind
Hahaha black holes üï≥
Fucking Democrats ruined World Science Festival by banning live audience.
Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?
Black holes don&#39;t exist
What if we are a experiment by advanced human civilization that set us out here to see how we would advance or how long it would take us to figure out the universe

Nah!
Not only is the guest intelligent but so is the host!
The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different
I can&#39;t believe I sat through an hour interview about a blurry blackhole picture, and enjoyed every moment of it.
Please share with other people my two brief videos. Thanks!!
Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.

So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right

Okay that explains those black holes but how do you get a device IP address into a black hole device status how does that happen this is a real question

Want to see them at kids scales since there a magnetic strand to mass you can see them with magnet iron or new neodymium if you split them there bind by a atomic particle line if you watch on YouTube or if you have the material you may see the very centre and on old bar magnet if you get the iron fine and just right from the top poles out you can see the second hole and at the very centre a small bend at the very centre I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like a transformer air gap or impurities at the join but I&#39;ve repeated this with new N42 neodymium and a rubber to hold them apart the magnetic field interaction with the fabric feild interact if you get it just right also showing a gauze line to the material magnet and a bind at the centre you can check there safe!.

I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus.

How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.

A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

The more I hear about the &quot;chicken &amp; egg&quot; co-evolution of black holes &amp; galactic formation, the less I see a need for some invisible hand that &quot;holds&quot; stars &amp; galactic structures together.... not the least because the latter has such a disregard for the majesty of GR itself (which is that the distortion of space-time is a direct function of mass/energy itself.. with black holes &amp; the Big Bang themselves being a set of very specific categorical examples, even if GR itself breaks down in the jurisdictions of both phenomena). <br><br>I think from good ole Fritz Zwicky on down to the current crop of post doc &quot;dark matter&quot; hunters... everyone needs to just take a little break from their relentless and, very likely, futile hunt for that invisible particle. <br><br>What they attributed to Mr. Invisible --- a &quot;particle&quot; that must be at least as indifferent to baryon but is even more ubiquitous that isn&#39;t anywhere to be found, in reality (likely because it doesn&#39;t exist) --- may just be a natural by-product of large structural phenomena.

The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking‚Ä¶ once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can‚Äôt control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can‚Äôt control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you‚Äôre still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there‚Äôs a gravity-like force that‚Äôs infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can‚Äôt stay in any one moment in time and can‚Äôt move through time‚Ä¶ Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.  But I seem to remember that there was a threshold size that when reached would initiate the beginning of a black hole&#39;s evaporation. Anyway, I would like to see a video about the life span of black holes.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me.

Sad to see Brian Greene growing old üò¢
Fantastic interview! Great questions. Great guest. Great topic. Thank you!
And what we see is actually maybe a moment  millions of years ago what about it now?
I like the metepher a hundred years handshake with Einstein or other scientists to discuss ideas
It&#39;s a great work! But how can you assure that what you see from the radio telescope is a real black hole?
From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.
This made me cry tears of joy. Humanity is so amazing sometimes! We found and proved something even Einstein thought was beyond possibility. ü•≤
What an insightful discussion ! impressed by the humility of the guest and sharpness of Brian&#39;s questions üëç

The EHT is truly a marvelous display of technology
Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.
Perhaps black hole is really invisible body. Among many reasons there are maybe one more. My brain can&#39;t add anything to this enormous frequent mass.

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.
@@shawns0762 <i>&quot;If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.&quot;</i><br><br>There is plenty of evidence which you cannot explain. Hint: reply to those papers in the peer-reviewed literature. Nobody cares what crackpots on youtube think.
@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = Œº/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I know this video is about the incredible achievement of seeing the unseeable but I have to do a shout out for Brian Green to be the best interviewer. Respectful, knowledgeable, patient, and inquisitive, he has a set a real high bar in terms of leading such discussions.
I love learning that they&#39;ve been able to use data from multiple telescopes across the world to create higher resolution information than any one of the telescopes can alone. Interferometry has been used for many years at the Very Large Array telescope in western New Mexico. I&#39;m happy to hear that similar technology has been expanded to encompass the world. I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

No, we&#39;re not &quot;seeing&quot; black holes in any coherent sense. It&#39;s an extrapolation from observation of effects back to a visual representation of what the efficient cause <b>could</b> be. And because we are visually fixated and biased we think of this as proof.

Other than the lateral thinkers (I think I&#39;m one but maybe I can ask you to shed a light first on what you understand them to be?) I wholeheartedly agree with you!! It indeed is amazing and gratifying!
lateral thinkers don&#39;t fit into your sequence. lateral thinkers are important to science and technology and problem solving/progress in general
@@mehridin Absolutely. Although at times I have difficulty explaining my thought process to the majority of linear thinkers (not derogatorily used here) and I notice that it is conversely true too, they have difficulty either understanding or transferring their information to me. My fuzzy logic is difficult to translate, and most of lateral thinkers and visual thinkers have their own version so there is hardly any consistent way to learn or translate. Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to. Occupational hazard of being a lateral/visual thinker.

How far away is the closest black hole? How far does it have a gravitational pull? Do we have any idea?
closest known black hole is 6000 lightyears away; and is described being about the size of an apple
@@blackrockerchic17 cool
Cygnus X1 is probably the nearest BH ,about 6000 LY from Earth.
The gravitational pull is proportional to the mass of a given black hole, just like any other stellar bodies.. e.g. if our sun becomes a black hole, which it won&#39;t, the orbits of our planets won&#39;t get affected.
closest black hole to Earth is actually about 3,000 light years away. &quot;V616 Monocerotis&quot; <br>Its gravitational pull is incredibly strong, but we don&#39;t really know much about it.

Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
‚àÜ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question üß©
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !

@@alexandrekassiantchouk1632 I agree with this. They don&#39;t exist.

@@DivergentDroid Do you know what is &quot;back of the envelope proof&quot; in science? If you do, then check one on the back cover of my book. That&#39;s a good start.
@@alexandrekassiantchouk1632 Yep, nothing but pseudoscience. Your back of the envelope proof is a rough calculation based on math theory of things that have never been shown to exist in reality and certainly do not have any mathematical values you can calculate with. You cannot reify math theory from a mans mind into reality. Einstein&#39;s ideas total garbage. Mass attracting mass, total garbage. No scientific validity for either of them yet these ideas are what your back of the envelope proof is based on. Time is a human creation which is conceptual only. It cannot be manipulated as a variable. Do you actually Think space is a vacuum with gas giants in it? Total fantasy.

He can form a Belief or he can have Knowing. You have beliefs. I know this because I have seen your videos. Knowing comes from scientific validation of cause and effect relationships. Belief comes from listening to smooth sounds propaganda such as Einstein&#39;s garbage. Belief is the enemy of knowing. It&#39;s all about what you can Prove. Can you prove such concepts as time dilation No. Can you prove the MilkyWay or lights in the sky you call gas giants exist in a vacuum? (even your assumed non empty vacuum with quantum fluctuations) No. You have a Belief Only. You entire body of work falls apart as fantasy.

If &quot;space&quot; were a vacuum, that gas would have been gone and you would have suffocated long ago. We have a gradient. You can Only have a gradient of gas in a closed system, otherwise, yep.. as above, that gas would have to expand into and fill that available volume and you would be dead. We live in a closed system with a gradient because we have pressurization.

‚ùìrecycles the universe
Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy

If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?

Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!üëèüëèüëè<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.

If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! üëè
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name

The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I‚Äôd give you one thousand dishes. Brian‚Äôs a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.

How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind

Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?

The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different

Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.

That&#39;s not an actual picture of our black hole now is it it&#39;s computer rendition of it isn&#39;t it
So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right

I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus.

How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.
If we use Newton&#39;s language and time is only a parameter, how close can we describe the unescapable force of the event horizon? <br><br>We don&#39;t have space turning to time, instead we need to assume what? Do things just disappear from the universe disobeying thermodynamics, or is it just fuzzy-math-really-really-super-strong?
Is there some way to see those four different renders that each team came up with, for m87?
A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

Seeing the unseeable, isn‚Äôt that kinda like brainwashing? Don‚Äôt pay attention to what you see, hear and feel, just believe what we‚Äôre saying, because science, hypothesis, flask, Bunsen burner!   It‚Äôs quite amazing how you can watch a science festival and hear nothing but pseudoscience. Astronomy? Cosmology? Astrophysics? Evolution? The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking‚Ä¶ once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can‚Äôt control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can‚Äôt control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you‚Äôre still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there‚Äôs a gravity-like force that‚Äôs infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can‚Äôt stay in any one moment in time and can‚Äôt move through time‚Ä¶ Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me.

From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.

Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.

@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = Œº/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to.

Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
‚àÜ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question üß©
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !
I really want to attend live WSF üòÑ
This guy is Bob Saget&#39;s genius doppelganger XD
Geeeeeee What an achievement, and as time passes Einstein brilliant becomes more and more profound
He was always profound...it just took the world 100 years to realise it.
Time and light disappear beyond sight. But we don‚Äôt need time or light where we‚Äôre going. They are nothing more than shackles holding us back. Like the black hole, unshackled
good job nasa you spent 10 bil to capture an image strikingly similar to that of 500 years ago nice
I love our beautiful universe... Incredibly powerful beauty...
Great episode
I have never heard a black hole described so well
I would like to meet those who watched and commented on this vicarious journey into space time.  We need to form a watch club.

‚ùìrecycles the universe
Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy

Brilliant
Maybe we need to question our idea that a big brain equates to a smarter creature.  The Shetland Sheepdog has a vary small brain compared to the Collie, but both are very intelligent dogs.
Brian Greene has what it takes to be a great interviewer ‚ù§‚ù§
I have not seen one ape turn into a human.
wow, this dude loves to hear himself talk
I read the book and enjoyed thisi  interview, can&#39;t help but notice whenBrian asks the .ost difficult questions the response doesn&#39;t address it in fact he distracts with something else. Examples are &quot;other reasons explored&quot; and &quot;why didn&#39;t anyone else notice the markings&quot;
It was so difficult for me to ease into his informal way of talking and that ridiculous cowboy hat. But it is obviously my bias because he doesn&#39;t match my inner image of a scientist
What a wind bag!
Or there were a lot more of us than there were of them. The simplest explanation often turns out to be most right.
Carefully crafted image and exaggerates all his discoveries. Don‚Äôt be fooled, read the criticism about him by fellow paleoanthropologists.
Lee Berger is a showman, and in part a huxter and charlatan. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs not a trained professional in his field, but he jumps to wild conclusions and interprets his data to fit those conclusions rather than just letting it (the data) speak for itself. I‚Äôm disappointed that he‚Äôs gotten so much of the attention he craves these past few years. Most other paleoarchaeologists resent his self-aggrandizement and his creaky anthropological conclusions. Be critical when you listen to people making big claims.
Right at the start of this is the question &quot;What set us apart from the other human species [that we shared the world with], and why did we prevail?&quot;. Was it all our especially nice qualities? - Offhand I&#39;d conjecture it was for the same reason we prevailed over all kinds of indigenous peoples and more peaceful societies and communities with weak defenses or less-advanced technologies. And that is that the stronger, greedier, and  fiercer amongst us killed them all off.
This guys ego is off the charts.I would have loved to learn about the finds and the science but i got so sick of listening to mr Bergers self love i had to stop.He could learn so much from Brian Greene. i have learned so much from Brian from many hours of his talks and not once have i heard him brag about how great he is.A key complaint in the peer reviews of Berger and his team is that they didn‚Äôt employ geoscience to support their arguments ‚Äì which are uncertain, to put it mildly.Hopefully, geoscience will be employed in the Rising Star cave system and we will one day learn the tantalizing truth about whether or not naledi and its orange-sized brain really was lighting fires and burying its dead, and possibly carving geometrical lines on cave walls ‚Äì or if that is a romantic interpretation of ancient hominins who got fatally lost in a winding, pitch-black cave and died ther
Why do so many people, especially from the U.S (or so it seems), always say ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù by default- thus omitting the country they are, in fact, referring to?
He‚Äôs braver than me, I would of never crawled in there lol
This is all hogwash. There is no definitive answer as to human evolution.
Sure there is. We may never be able to discover it, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not an answer.
What an amazing storyteller
Fantastic!   Question: Once the initial documentation is done, is it not possible/allowed to expand the size of the narrow passages?
He talks about that in the video. The geology is such that breaking off the wrong part could collapse the whole thing.
This is the worst. Half of the talk is over, and this narcissistic person is still talking about himself.
What most people do not know is that Berger&#39;s and Hawk&#39;s &quot;assertions&quot; have not stood up to peer review.  In fact, their &quot;work&quot; has been savaged by dozens of highly qualified anthropologists.  For example:  Why did Berger&#39;s team not date the fire evidence in the Naledi cave?  The assertion that funerary rituals were performed is at best a wild fantasy.  the &quot;stone tool&quot; find is nebulous.  The &quot;cave art&quot; is likewise nefarious.  Berger is the type of guy that if you invited him to dinner, you&#39;d probably find him in your daughter&#39;s bedroom.  There are so many questionable assertions made by this team that the only thing remotely elucidating about the find is the bones.  And they haven&#39;t even tried to extract DNA from the molars.
Behavior is not a question of brain size but of brain processes. My brain is literally bigger than Einstein‚Äôs, just not as good. I see no reason why these primitive ancestors could not have had burial rituals.
The human origin story is as awe inspiring and mysterious as the universe. I can‚Äôt imagine what the landscape, and how amazing the night sky must have looked! Awesome interview!

thank you for this remarkable conversation! it boggles the mind - in a good wayüôÇ
Great, amazing story!  And on top of everything else he&#39;s accomplished he&#39;s really a master storyteller!  You&#39;ll be glued to your seat!
Great presentation. I am in finance and have been driven by the same mindset. I always say: ‚ÄúNever let anyone make you believe that there is nothing else you can do to contribute or improve.‚Äù
How wonderful Lee, your teams, your children, your account of these remarkable discoveries. for getting thin and then getting in-side that tiny space then finding those carvings on the wall.  long may you continue to inspire great science and discovery,  and just so you know, I am officially adopting you, so that you can...&quot;Oh please tell me that all over again&quot;   Just brilliant and Kindest regards, Keith, Drakensberg South Africa.
Iv&#39;e watched every Lee Burger interview, lecture, movie I can find but this is the best. Maybe because Brian Greene is so good.
Hearing this stuff is extremely interesting, but seeing it is absolutely incredible!
The argument and evidence that the location of the bones was not the result of funeral or burial practices, is also available on YouTube. I think it‚Äôs only right that anyone interested should look it up.
Wow, knowledge sure is neat, huh?
what an extraordinary account of an extraordinary career of discovery:<br><br>finding his passion <br>sticking with this passion for 17 years with little to show for<br>nurturing the next generation of scientists<br>pushing open access to scarce archeological data<br>humbling of the human species<br>complicating the definition of being human<br>greatest time to explore has yet to come, the greatest time to explore is now<br><br>the list goes on...
One thing comes to mind about those small brains: size doesn&#39;t matter
The audience are morons and unappreciative. I would have been giving this guy multiple standing ovations!!
Outstanding presentation!  And discovery, Lee Berger. Thank whatever gods may be for people like you. Keep on keeping on and telling us about it.
This guy was one lucky American bastard who had the protection of the best terrorist to make these discoveries. I love this guy.
Such a brilliant mind and story teller
Thank you. It was a very interesting guest!
I always enjoy hearing this account about this astonishing discovery.
Oh wow! saw the actual cave experience before this. So amazing!
Other countries are screwed. <br>It is fake, not really a person when the camera cuts to the rear. <br>Just a matter of time though...
This might be my favorite interview ever.  I am speechless and can‚Äôt wait for further discoveries.  Thank you to everyone involved.
Thank you Brian Greene &amp; WSF for bringing those of us from other milieu and neophytes in sciences (like myself) closer to it. I am learning enormously from these talks.  ü•∞
Amazing talk!
ridiculous
Maybe the tribe hid in the cave and and couldn&#39;t get out and staved there ..
hew didnt explain why trees were next to the caves,,,
Evolution is bogus Dude it&#39;s nonsense like climate change
This might sound pedantic, but I don‚Äôt think it is. If humans and Neanderthal bred then they are not different species, because different species cannot breed. Therefore, we are the same species. <br>Back to the program.
If individuals can always produce fertile offspring, they are the same species; if never, they are different species even if they share a common origin. The problem is when fertile offspring only sometimes happen. If 99 out of 100 offspring are fertile, they are almost guaranteed to be at most subspecies; if only 1 out of 100 are fertile, virtually everyone agrees they are different species.<br><br>The problem is when the fertile offspring rate is somewhere between the 99 and the 1. Do 50/50 rates qualify as the same species? What about 70/30, in either direction?
@@Archon1995 yes, I agree. That‚Äôs why I wanted to state it because in the beginning of the video he said ‚Äúdifferent species‚Äù and that didn‚Äôt make sense to me. <br>I don‚Äôt know whether the error deviation is for us to decide scientifically or if there is a hard line between one species and another. As you stated 70/30, 50-50, etc.
Like a &quot;who done it?&quot; that you can&#39;t put down, this &quot;who is it&quot; story keeps you entranced to the last frame.  Thanks so much for taking the time for great story telling.
Curiousness is such an essential trait to have.  Encouraging that in children is the most important job in parents and teachers, it gives a yearning for something outside of ourselves and that gives one the itch to learn more. Sets a life of passion that is the spark to keep us moving forward !  Dr Berger rose to the challenges and continues to discover the lineage of man by his commitment to research and finding new technologies to find sites. And what discoveries!! So fascinating!
Just finished watching, absolutely awesome! It&#39;s 11:42 p.m., I&#39;m going out to dig in the yard right now.
OK. Almost halfway in and I&#39;ve learned NOTHING about the &quot;story of Humankind&quot;. But I know all about this guy&#39;s career. Very misleading and very uninteresting.
I&#39;m a quarter of the way in and all I&#39;ve heard about is this guy&#39;s career. Nothing about &quot;attributes that set our species apart&quot;. Very unsatisfying so far.
I had friends that were house sitting at Donald Johansan&#39;s apartment in Berkeley when he was in Africa...so my girlfriend and I visited one evening...I had no idea who Donald was, we were eating pizza in the living room...and we put in a vhs tape (National Geographic) ...about his work...and I noticed this book on the shelf...Lucy...so I bought it and it introduced me to that type of occupation...I had already read about √áatalh√∂y√ºk... I remember this moment and it was just friends spending time together...I am 64...I was 26 then...memory is amazing
Admittedly unresearched but I think we&#39;re the only creature capable of belonging to multiple groups.
Just wanna point out‚Ä¶<br>Not all DNA ‚Äúsharing‚Äù is necessarily ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù.  ü§≠
Surely even the laziest brain would not say there is nothing to find out. Look how fast things advance.
Amazing find and story. Human arrogance is amazing - why is it so unbelievable that a species with a small brain could engage in such a ritualistic or &quot;programmed&quot; behaviour of bringing their deceased to a gathering place? Just as birds migrate every year to a specific gathering place or build amazing nests...and other animals have programmed behaviours - perhaps this behaviour is programmed into the human psyche. We big-brained humans carry it on thinking it is culture when it could be something much, much deeper than that.
Awesome amazing story! Wow<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ePgfY-K2Kp6Mr8oP1oqAwAc"></a>
That&#39;s how you do an interview. Ask, shut up and listen and occasionally ask a brief question for clarification. You don&#39;t don&#39;t put your opinions out there or constantly interrupt the person when they&#39;re about to say something interesting or just start talking yourself about what you think. It&#39;s very rare to see an interview like this. Good job!
You&#39;re so right!
I agree with you 100%. On a funny note, this guest doesn‚Äôt need an interviewer just someone to keep him between a 2 hour limit. This guy could talk for hours. üòÇ
Mr Green has nothing to say because all the digging stuff CAN NOT prove or even add up to anything real other than a pile of bones... All this stuff is no better than educated guesses \ common sense other than the dates that ARE scientifically proven numbers..
a great collection of stupid s-it
Great episode!!
Roughly 50,000 generations for ever 1 million years. We have only just begun to dip our toes into the incredible story of our ancestors.
HATS OFF TO THE ONES, WHO GO INTO CAVES,INTO SEAS, ON THE CRATER OF A VOLCANOES. BRAVING THE NUMBING ICYNESS OF THE ANTARTIC. TO THE ASTRONAUTS WHO TRAVEL INTO SPACE. ONES WHO FIGHT TERROR WITHIN THEMSELVES  FOR THE REWARD OF DISCOVERY.
CASSOWARIES-THOSE LARGE NEAR FIVE FOOT BIRDS OR OSTRICH LIKE BIRDS, WHO ROAMED THE FORESTS OR PLAINS WHERE PLENTIFUL. HOW HUMANS SURVIVED IN THE FIRST MILLION YEARS IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE. WE HUMANS HAVE LEARNED TO SLAUGHTER EACH OTHER BY THE MILLIONS,YET WE DOMINATE THE EARTH. HOWEVER THE ANIMALS MENTIONED HERE ARE NEARLY EXTINCT.
HUMANS, BY THE WAY OF EVOLUTION NEEDS REVISING. IN A WORLD OF WILD ANIMALS. LIKE IN THE FIRST MILLION YEARS OF &quot;HUMAN&quot; EXISTENCE,A HUMAN NEEDS TO BE STRONG LIKE AN APE ABLE TO RUN FAST FROM WILD DOGS. HYEINAS WHO AMBUSH THIER PREY, OR LIONS LIKE BEASTS WHO HUNT IN PACKS. THESE ANIMALS WERE THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF A PERSON. MAYBE A HALF A TON OR MORE. HUMAN BABIES GROW VERY SLOWLY. WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO RUN IN TWO WEEKS OF BIRTH LIKE  FOUR FOOTED ANIMALS CAVES ARE NOT SAFE. SO THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THESE DEFICENTS AS A HUMAN. WE SHOULD BE EXTINCT. OR VERY SCARCE.
Didn&#39;t take long too bored out of my mind üòî and I know he&#39;s loving everything he&#39;s done üíØ
I think dr Berger discover the true particle of good
Sorry but, I was pretty turned off by the size of his ego. I enjoyed the subject, the science and the discoveries, but the guest made everything about himself. Everything he talked about was the ‚Äúmost important‚Äù, ‚Äúgreatest ever‚Äù etc. It was like he was trying to be a preacher or something.
my human jaw dropped...thank you!
Fantastically interesting!
HMM <br>SPOOKY <br>WHY WAS THE OTHER GUY KILLED IN UK
If you just tell the truth, the story would be about slavery of every type and kind. This is why progress is so &quot;important.&quot; We can&#39;t have people leading free, simple lives. We have to shackle their labor, their bodies, or their minds. Tribes disappear because they are free. The slavers always create problems and then compound them with their &quot;we need more money - progress.&quot; Meanwhile anyone who resists is jailed or killed. Freedom is not our story, but it is a nice story. Abolish political slavery!

Well I would say you need to do some research. This has been known for quite a while now.
Lee Burger is disrupting the traditional human story.  It‚Äôs a lot like how BEV‚Äôs are disrupting traditional automotive.  The Rising Star Cave will continue changing the science even if some of the things the papers written on it don‚Äôt pan out.
Wow.  If you don‚Äôt watch this to the end you miss the most important find.
Phenomenal!!
Humans are highly social, hyper intelligent bipedal apes. Thats the best definition my uneducated brain can muster.
It is not that hard to believe Naledi could care for their dead....just look at  how some mammals from elephants, whales, etc that grieve over a dead baby. They just didn&#39;t have appendages to perform burial rituals. Bravo!
I guess that lake Dorothy comment was for those too dumb to know the girls can do that too.
I am mostly a physics geek, and have watched many previous episodes of WSF, but this is the best program yet. Absolutely a &quot;must watch&quot; show.

Yes, yes, ≈µonderful.
nice hat
I‚Äôm loving all the coverage of this amazing discovery - I‚Äôm so glad this team are so PR savvy, we need more of this in science.
The only thing I am not sure about is why burials should be human exclusive? Don‚Äôt elephants have funerals and don‚Äôt crow bury their dead children with whole extended family participating and cowing ? I think the idea of human exclusivity and their relationship to ritual is highly just a nonsense.  Think of chimpanzees, when they running for office aka alpha male position, they hold and kiss babies from community that are totally unrelated to them.   Hypocrisy is not just human either.   Time to get over those old cliches and stereotypes
Crow? Are you talking about the bird we call a crow? They do not bury their dead. But they sometimes will gather around up in the trees or on a telephone wire and squawk.  Elephants do not have funerals, but it is true that if they come across bones of a dead elephant they will stop and pick up those bones and stay with those bones for awhile. But I would not say that is a funeral, because it is by chance that they find those bones. Scientists think they are trying to figure out what death is by picking up those bones. They do not go looking for the bones, but just come across them by chance. You know, not everything on the web is true. Learn some critical thinking skills.
@@LadyLeda2 Thank you for advice, I do critical thinking , that‚Äôs why I am against blanket statements , when we don‚Äôt know the best scientific approach is to say we don‚Äôt know. I think we are a long way to go, if we ever figure out consciousness and it‚Äôs exclusivity to humans. I don‚Äôt take someone‚Äôs opinion on it‚Äôs face value and scientific fact  . Till five years ago, art and fire were exclusive to human, now we know Neanderthal had both and the myth of human being an exclusive tool making species been long debunked.  Etc.  I don‚Äôt want to argue with you.  It is good that you know a lot   I am like Socrates, the more I know, I realize, I know nothing.  Thanks again for reply.

Background music  stop me listening your video  <br>Sorry
It&#39;s probably sacrilege to say this but for the safety of all and ease of access... why couldn&#39;t they somehow in a least invasive way to avoid a cave-in or destroy more artifacts, but to remove the tough spots to slide past to smooth out their access into the depths of this cave?  What a great venture this has been Dr. Berger and all involved with this, and all that the sciences do to clarify the mysteries of our being!
We shouldnt presume that multiple species of past human species got along just fine because we share DNA. Moodern humans cannot even get along with each other. The sharing of DNA is more likely to be rape cases. Imagine how humans treated other branches of their species given how they treat each other in todays world . The differences would have been more than just skin colour.
these carvings somehow remind me of a map with possible locations of the graves. That would explain the erasure and drawing over. Because burying at the same spot multiple bodies in such cramped space meant you need to find where the older burial spots were for which a map is desirable :D agree?
Probably something to do with burial rights or taxes.
We in a ‚Äòfalse reality‚Äô , the truth will remain distant.
To clarify and explain, it is my THEORY that every advanced human like species exterminated the previous inferior one, probably with better tool making. I do not think any human like species went naturally extinct like other species do.
What makes us human is the concious intelligence and ability and desire to exterminate the the previous &#39;human like&#39; species. Only humans want to do this to their own type. Though we are the same species now, MANY still carry that feelings deep inside.The growth of the brain DOES HAVE ITS PROBLEMS!
This guy gives me snake oil salesman vibes.
Thats why science relies on data and evidence, not feelings.
I am 74 years old now. When I was young, from about age 5 or 6, I wanted to be a paleontologist or archeologist. (Somebody gave me a dinosaur play set for Christmas. I had a book on natural history &amp; dinosaurs that was my favorite &quot;bed time story.&quot;) In high school my parents &amp; teachers convinced me that there was no future in either since everything had been discovered. (We had King Tut&#39;s tomb &amp; T-Rex &amp; Brontosaurus. What else was there to discover?) I graduated high school in 1967. Lots of interesting things have been discovered, in both fields, since then. I worked in insurance &amp; reinsurance most of my life and often found myself digging into the history of those subjects.<br>Here you have one of the greatest discoveries ever: an improbable human species from before there were humans!

What? Do not understand a thing you said. Do you speak English?
What a nonsensical fantasy. Not everything said by scientists is scientific. Dr John Lennox
Maybe they were hiding from larger hominids that were out to kill them. Everyone crawled into these hidey places and then died of hydration and starvation.
I am still convinced they got stuck inside the cave and couldnt get out..
Greene is such a good interviewer. He draws great explanations from guests outside of his own field of expertise.
So the bodies of these hominids were either deposited by other living hominids or living hominids deposited themselves, as in sick individuals who went into a cave to die? <br>I&#39;m inclined to believe the latter based on the difficulty of entering the cave and moving a corpse down through the chamber.<br>I&#39;m also aware of whales and elephants going to particular places to die thereby creating burial sites.
What a great storyteller!!

What a fabulous interview!
When Prof Berger talked about his crawling through the chute, I involuntarily cursed out loud
This is wonderful!
Amazing discovery--those early 1970&#39;s chairs!
Looking at that cave entrance I can why there were bones.   They were chased down there ... getting hunted by something SCARY AF.  It makes more sense that they were scared out of their minds seeking ANY SORT OF REFUGE !!!!
... although they were tiny little buggers. so maybe.
I think you need to watch this video again and pay attention more. They did tons of research because they themselves had a hard time believing that this species actually were putting their dead down into this cave. In the end, that was the only conclusion. Mr. Berger talks more about that in other earlier interviews he has done.
Mind blowing . I&#39;m the type that always tries to stand outside the box and look in , like Lee Berger and Brian Greene seem to be . From outside the box looking in I can&#39;t help but wonder if this is why we haven&#39;t found THE MISSING LINK . I know theres theories that try to fill it in . I&#39;ve even as a kid seen the iceman personally at a museum,  i was young but i think it was the New York Metropolitan.  But even he never quite struck me as a MISSING LINK . We keep finding all these different hominoids but this one seems to show show aspects of many different ones . Maybe the missing link is actually the convergence of multiple hominids,  including ours and Neanderthal,  interbreeding ? Maybe the breeding of humans is more like that of dogs than most people are willing to accept . ü§î

When he saw those etchings in black light and when he went down on his knees and saw the &#39;hashtag&#39;, the moment of realization... I can imagine what that moment must have felt like. This talk is so damn inspiring. Thank you.
sadly he had to equivocate about what it was like for him claiming it was probably this physical phenomena and that physical phenomena that made him feel like he was having an intense spiritual experience.  I hope someday people don&#39;t feel like they have to hide those experiences in order to be &quot;scientists.&quot;  But, yep, to your point -- just try to imagine that moment!!  Thrilling!
they keep rewriting the same story over and over and over again. And they still don&#39;t get it right.<br>However mainstream science is still at the same rat-game of &quot;breathtaking developments&quot; as if it was a some hollytrash movie.<br>We might as well ask Chat GPT instead of the experts who basically remain within their expertise and nothing else much.
Remaining in your field of study is what makes you an expert.
Absolutely fascinating and captivating to this 67 year old former science/engineering student and geek. It&#39;s stuff like this that keeps my mind and inspiration young and vibrant, and recharges my spirituality ( not in the religious sense). <br>(I think <b>PBS&#39;</b> <i>NOVA</i> , or some other PBS presentation aired a film about this expedition, if my memory serves me correctly, within the past 5-7 (?) years.)<br>And kudos always to <b>_World Science Festival. _</b> It&#39;s great to see so many science sources carried on You Tube.
This has become my favorite story of adventure and scientific discovery even beyond the moon landing. What a privilege to have been a part of this. I would have given up a lot to be there, but I would never fit into those caves.  I&#39;m really grateful to all who did the job, of making it possible for all of us could see this take place.
I‚Äôve seen or read a lot of Dr. Berger work, but I never heard his life story before. He‚Äôs a fascinating character.
He definitely is interesting. I listened to many of the University lecture series and have seen dr. Berger quite a few times. But Bruce Green allowed him to tell so much more

Well, quantum science has taught us that consciousness doesn&#39;t reside in the brain...
Nope it hasn&#39;t.
Well not in your brain !
This is really fascinating to learn about. I still wonder if these proto humans actually practiced burial and writing themselves. <br>Given the time period these creatures died and were buried in this cave still corresponds with modern human existence, it is possible that our human ancestors were the ones who buried these creatures in this cave, not the creatures themselves. <br>Humans have buried animals for thousands of years, just like we bury our pets today. <br>I imagine some of our ancient ancestors might of lived in cohabitation with these proto humans for a long long time and even adopted them into their civilization like we do with our favorite animals. It seems totally normal that we&#39;d bury them like one of our own.
My thoughts too
In that case they would have been dinner.

This is super emotional for me, even bigger than the first time I looked at what was found in Rising Star Cave. This ties all the ends of this exploration thanks to this human. These are not human, these people are pre human. Same with our new ai. It is not human, will never be human, no matter if it wished to be, it will not be us.

We know almost nothing about our genome. We know a few the most basic proteins out of MILLIONS of folded DNA . Saying we see commonalities is nothing more than seeing the most basic and gross organizations  common in vertebrates.  And then there&#39;s cell biology. And I dont appreciate archeologists etc building plastic models around one bone,  or the flawed method of carbon dating.
We know everything about our genome that makes us. The other millions of folded DNA have been turned off by crisper. Anybody with critical thinking skills can figure out why crisper has turned those off in us. The plastic model was not built around one bone. It was built with many bones from several individuals to give us an idea of what this hominid looks like. I think you need to go back and watch this video again, only pay attention this time.
@@LadyLeda2 I disagree.  There are multiple artifacts from all over the world tjsy have been filled in rother by plastic model or painting on pottery fragments etc.. dont get all upset because your &#39;scientific&#39; world view is questioned. Science as a religion is very unattractive. <br>Nothing has been turned off in our genes as a matter of permanent course. Its something you vant prove and it doesn&#39;t stand to reason. There is no difference in organisms that doesn&#39;t reside in the genes.  Differences don&#39;t appear out of thin air.  All the genome is involved in the making and functioning of each organisms parts. Apes might have 2 arms, 5 digits and 2 bipedal legs , but they doesnt mean we are literally 99% common genes because it leaves out 99% of the genes.

What makes us human is cooking. No other animal cooks. The calories available from food go way up after cooking. Nobody ever seems to mention this incredibly obvious fact. There&#39;s a book called &quot;catching fire: how cooking made us human&quot; which explains this concept in depth through a collection of stories that are very interesting to read. If our brain is what makes us human then how did we get this brain? That&#39;s the real question which is totally ignored by modern science. It&#39;s not about the brain, it&#39;s about the length of the intestines. Once you understand how human energy works you&#39;ll realize this is true.
Funny‚Ä¶I‚Äôm fairly sure humans can (and have) gotten by just fine without eating cooked foods.  They can be soaked, frozen and thawed, sprouted, fermented and consumed in all kinds of ways that break down, propagate, or unlock nutrients otherwise unavailable. Cooking is just one (albeit more convenient) limited method of doing so.

My ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is truth. If it‚Äôs not true, I don‚Äôt want any part of it. The geology that we have of a number of mega sequences of consecutive water deposited sediment layers over a mile deep with fossils in them around the world  on every continent necessitates a global flood catastrophe. I know that hurts the belief of every other made up alternate narrative. It just happens to be a fact that we are all the descendants of those who stepped off of the Ark in the area around Mesopotamia. <br><br>You can‚Äôt argue with known human history or ancient calendars going back only 5,000 years. The ancient civilizations are all descended from Noah who had sixteen grandsons that became the sixteen ancient the civilizations each with their own paternal haplogroup lineage. The Bible is the only text that outlines the following Table of Nations.<br><br>1)  Tubal Italy K,<br>2)  Javan Greek sea people T,<br>3)  Tiras Thracians L,<br>4)  Magog Asian O,<br>5)  Meshek Siberians N,<br>6)  Madai Medes Q,<br>7)  Gomer Europeans R,<br>8)  Arphaxad Arabs Hebrews I&amp;J,<br>9)  Elam Elamites H,<br>10)  Asshur Assyrians G,<br>11)   Aram Arameans F<br>12)  Lud Lydians F2, <br>13)  Cush Cushites A B &amp; C.<br>14)  Phut early Phoenicians E1,<br>15)  Canaan Canaanites E2, <br>16)  Mitzrayim Egyptians E3, <br>D is likely the Sinite tribe from Canaan. <br>C is the descendants of Nimrod since they can‚Äôt possibly be from anyone else. <br><br>Neanderthals are Japhethites and Denisovans are a mix of Japhethites and Hamites, not Semitic. It shows up on DNA maps and charts. Every grandson of Noah and their descendants have their own paternal Y chromosome haplogroup lineage! I can name all sixteen of them like I just did and give you each of their haplogroups!<br><br>The evolutionary out of Africa claim is exactly backwards since the <b>oldest</b> progenitor is Japheth the ancestor of Eurasians then the Semitic populations of Shem and then the Hamitic African is the youngest progenitor with their eldest sons connecting the three different families descended from the three sons of Noah. <br><br>It took me a while to understand that the evolutionary claim is assuming that SNP markers are being gained forming the stair steps out of Africa when <b>the reality is</b> that the original SNP markers cited are in fact being lost forming the opposite stair steps out of West Asia as known human history shows.  <br><br>The stair step out of Africa claim has to be addressed because the SNP markers are <b>real</b> evidence but the evolutionary assumption is exactly backwards.<br><br>The correct view requires that the older most original genomes of the Japhethites be connected to the Semitics by way of the eldest son of Shem which is Arphaxad (IJ). Arphaxad‚Äôs descendants can share the (IJK) SNP marker with the descendants of his uncle Japheth while the descendants of his younger brothers do not share that same (IJK) SNP.<br><br>You have to root the tree with Japheth the oldest son of Noah and then the oldest son of Shem (IJ Arphaxad) and then Elam and then Asshur and then the youngest brothers Aram and Lud. So you have to begin with the <b>most original</b> Y chromosome of Noah‚Äôs oldest son Japheth and then the changes occur in the people who were born later. It‚Äôs not necessarily a stair step of descendency.  It‚Äôs changes in the Y chromosome with time. <b>Arphaxad isn‚Äôt descended from Japheth.</b> He just shares a marker with his uncle that his father used to have when he was born. Shem then lost the marker when Arphaxad‚Äôs younger brothers were born.<br><br>The descendants of Shem are then connected to the descendants of Ham by way of Nimrod the King (C) the the eldest son of Cush who is the eldest son of Ham. So the Hamitic CF (xD&amp;E) paternal haplogroup SNP marker was lost to the <b>odd ones out</b> and less original younger brothers and cousins verifying the Table of Nations outlined in Genesis.üí• Learn the Bible before trying to learn anything else.<br><br>It‚Äôs also noteworthy that the D paternal haplogroup lines up with the E2 haplogroup of Canaan which is his son‚Äôs tribe of Sinim the Biblical namesake of China. So the only Hamitic haplogroups outside of Africa are the C of Nimrod and the D of the Canaanite tribe of Sinim which is still there in Andaman, Tibetan, Mongolian, Chinese and Japanese areas today.
Oh my goodness!!! I am sorry you believe all this. You know these stories in the old testament are copies of ancient stories found written on cuneiform tablets, from ancient Mesopotamia and Persia. The British Museum has thousands of these tablets and AI has translated them all. And Jesus never said he was the son of God. He implied it, but never said it. Even though he was asked many many times. This is why the Jews of today do not think he is the messiah. They are still waiting for the Messiah to come. There is no evidence of a worldwide flood.  Flooding has been happening on this Earth for thousands and thousands of years. What they are not telling you is the time period these floods occurred. Some are recent some are ancient. All major floods will leave a scar on the landscape for us to see. We can see the scars of many floods all over the Earth, but they happened at different times. There is evidence of a very large local flood around Jerusalem. Watch out for those wolfs that come disguised in sheep&#39;s clothing. Do some research for yourself. You also need to do some research on ancient man. All this haplogroup this and descendants of that sounds like hocus pocus to me. You can not know your haplogroup group unless you have a living relative to send in their DNA. I know, because I have done that. Someone is pulling your leg. I have no problem with believing in a higher power that may or may not have created this universe, or any of the billions of other universes out there. Yes there are billions of universes, each with a black hole in the center just like ours. Check out NASA&#39;s James Web telescope pictures. NASA has a channel here on U-tube. Our universe is beautiful. We can even see new stars being born right in front of our eyes!!!! <br>The out of Africa for humans is true. We have the skeletons to prove it. We can see the progression of man in these skeletons. But that does not have to mean that God did not create us. Maybe he created the Earth with evolution in mind. Maybe that is what he wanted to happen. I don&#39;t know, but neither do you. The Bible is a great teaching book. The New Testament has a lot of teachings of how to be kind to one another. The Old testament is full of revenge and how God will punish you if you do wrong. So is your God merciful, or vengeful? Or both? Sounds like two different Gods to me. <br>What ancient calendars going back 5,000 years?  Have you see pictures of them, or did someone just tell you that? Again, I say do your research. Don&#39;t be a sheep that follows what others tell you. <br>You can not have DNA maps without having real live DNA. Whose DNA are they using? Is there a descendant that they got the DNA from? We can not trace their descendants because we do not know who their descendants are. Someone is feeding you false information and I am sorry about that. I feel you should find another Church that teaches true doctrine and not these false teachings. <br>I could say a lot more about the things you wrote. But I am tired and must get some sleep. My wish for you is to find a new Church that teaches love and acceptance. Jesus even loved the sinners. He who is without sin cast the first stone. Remember that.<br>Laurie
@@LadyLeda2  The First Covenant Scriptures has a lot of love that you were never told about. That&#39;s beside the point. I referenced actual known human history, not hearsay and the DNA of people around the world. DNA doesn&#39;t lie. Eurasians have Neanderthal DNA and it shows up on a map where people have the most Neanderthal DNA. The Cohen modal haplotype verifies the lineage of Hebrews and Arabs.<br><br>Geology consists of six mega sequences of flood sediment layers on every continent including Antarctica with buried fossils throughout. To deny the global flood is to deny reality. It&#39;s the only history that we have.

About re-writing history: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f7jm3T_hao&amp;t=46">0:46</a>‚ûúJune 18, 1858, Charles Darwin received a paper from Alfred Russel Wallace that includes nearly indentical conclusions about evolution as Darwin&#39;s own, prompting Darwin to publish his theory.

This makes me think that much or all of this suite of behaviors emerged early in the hominin lineage. Probably <i>H. naledi</i> aren&#39;t <i>that</i> special -- and these behaviors haven&#39;t been documented in earlier hominins because this cave location is just extraordinary in terms of preservation.<br><br>But here&#39;s a crazy thought -- the extant, non-human Great Apes learn to do things from watching humans that they would never come up with on their own. They are smart enough to perform these behaviors, but don&#39;t have they right mental constitution to come up with them themselves. What if <i>H. naledi</i> were picking up behaviors from early <i>H. sapiens</i> in the region?

Not the usual format for this channel. <br><br>I personally find Berger very untrustworthy. Starting with his ego, his marketing strategies, his gold-rush ambition-driven motivation to start working in this field (something he even compares to lottery), his survival in an area he himself describes as cut-throat, his desperation for success, even sending his own child into that cave, then his actual despair at a failing career before this discovery..... it would be hard to make a movie out of his life where all that doesn&#39;t make the audience suspect a super-villain origin story is unfolding....<br><br>If nothing else his treatment of this site leaves a lot to desire in terms of scientific procedure and clearly more concerned with profits than professionalism.

One year further scientists discover that color of light is able to switch off some parts of the brain. If this is true than this proof that ‚Äúsomething outside‚Äù is in total control of our brain and a brain function as a trigger for emotional and physical activity. Scientists seems to forget that we are a part of the Universe, without the Universe we cannot exist. We all look the same but are wired differently and that creates our uniqueness and ID. It seems perfectly logical too me that humans and animals are not a stand alone product in this huge multi-Universe. We are very sensitive and dependent to our surroundings in the Universe. Dark winter days feeds depression. The Moon as a big influence on our moods and the hormones cycle of women, without oxygen we die, and so on so on. So why on earth we believe there is nothing beyond the molecules in our brain? The reason is simple because it‚Äôs already complicated enough, being open minded for interference of the ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù makes it more tough to chew on with sleepless nights. Although finally scientists become more open for ‚Äúscience fiction‚Äù in science that proofs the quantum theory.

My first memory scares the bee-G-zus out of me. I have night terrors- and I&#39;ve always had the same one- there&#39;s a man with a stocking on his head coming through my window and I&#39;m trying to wake up and scream or do something, but I can&#39;t move. I&#39;ve never seen the guy before, no idea who he is- just a made-up guy, I guess. I don&#39;t have them very often - I&#39;ve had it happen maybe 6-7 times throughout my whole life, that I remember- and I&#39;m in my fifties. But I&#39;m always terrified, I hate that feeling of fighting so hard to move or scream but not being able to- it&#39;s unbelievably frustrating. I think because when you finally can move- and you go to beat this guy silly- there&#39;s no one there, nothing&#39;s happening- that realization takes literally seconds to happen- and then you have no outlet for this very real anger and fear you just experienced. Anyway- what&#39;s that got to do with my first memory- right? Getting there- a few years ago someone asked me what my first memory was and I really couldn&#39;t distinguish that tbh- which kind of bugged me. I had like little clips of some images in my head, but I couldn&#39;t tell if it was part of one coherent memory or what. So i really started concentrating on it- trying to relive that memory and piece it together- and I did. My first memory is of that man climbing through my window when I was only 3-4 years old- I remember watching him push the curtains to the side and come through- it was very early in the morning- I had Scooby Doo curtains- same guy. Apparently, I&#39;ve been dreaming about this dude since the seventies. Wth? Why would a 3‚Äì4-year-old kid have a night terror? More importantly, why is it about some guy breaking in through the window? Shouldn&#39;t I be dreaming of bugs bunny and friends at that age? Instead, I got some guy climbing through my window scaring the bee-g-zus out of me. I&#39;m such a weirdo.
Maybe memories from childhood still present in adolescence were recalled frequently during life. They were recalled because they were important once and still to a certain extent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2703">45:03</a>
I have musical notes flowing through my blood, so to speak. I play several instruments and cannot survive without music. I also speak several languages. This is just to give some context. Proust ‚Äòs use of olfactory memory was absolutely astute‚Ä¶ I have not had the direct ‚Äúrecollection‚Äù in months but there was something that used to remind me of some Playtex bottles that my mom gave me when I was a baby. They had slits on the sides and the milk was placed in a baggie that would go inside. I remember holding my bottle and putting my fingers through the slits. It has not happened in a while but there was some smell that always brought that memory to mind. I know I exercise certain parts of my brain that keep certain memory skills active as I am a professional interpreter. But, I used to recall conversations word per word as described here but I am not sure I recall as many as I used to‚Ä¶ which scares me a bit. Emotional trauma and dwelling in those negative, sad feelings certainly play quite a number in our memories, I am an example of that. So, to emphasize creating positive memories and not dwelling in the sad ones that are not necessarily is a must and I keep working hard on it. We can all do it!  How wonderful our brains are!  I love this conversation, I revisit it every few months, it is soothing and motivating.
Fascinating subject. My father had an exceptional memory. He could remember meals he&#39;d had at particular plane flights, who had been the captain, etc. He was in the airline industry for a long time, so his interest was there, but he was really great at remembering lots of things. I often quizzed him over the years to check if he really remembered so much and I never caught him in a mistake. He was phenomenal in remembering people&#39;s names too and who the person was, their background, even though he met lots of people because of his work. I think he had a sort of &quot;Mind Palace&quot; memory mnemonic system. I didn&#39;t inherit this from him, unfortunately. I forget names very often, wish my memory was as good as his was.
Having explained how memory works in such debth through a visual example was interesting, but how do blind humans form memories insight the brain?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=1500">25:00</a> Not a memory structure as per se but a cogent comprehension of preparatory/anticipatory from having watched others, known and unknown, also attempt/ride bikes...we are introspectively aware of likely outcomes...just the same as watching someone walk on the stones as they cross a stream, Same idiomatic contextualization hence introspective.. Not &#39;mimicry&#39;. Learned safety/defense/conduct. Consciousness aggregates and conflates for cogency/sapience. Evolutional construct is logical and reconciliatory not causal. Etc...etc...
With over 100 Trillion synaptic endings in the human brain, the complexity of the possible pathways is practically infinite.  But this is a different matter than the simple question of where (for example) that song was resting that I learned as a child, and yet, even now, after decades, can recall with the tiniest prod.  Moreover, the brain is certainly not the only organ with neurons is it?  Heart and stomach both have clusters of these that are immense.  And remarkably, these also, historically have been used to speak of the identity or personal &quot;uberich&quot; of the individual.

I think the extent and reach of human memory is a very different process for people. Some have extraordinary reach and depth of memory and others very brief. It&#39;s also different for people on different subjects, making it a personal and unique way in which our neurochemistry is defined and functions. I can see Dr Greene has a specific interest in this subject and I wonder, why is that?
Well the Irish psychiatrist mentioned about hallucinations, some people do other people do experience esoteric phenomena which is much different. Extraterrestrial abductions, ghost apparitions, smoke suddenly appearing, moving lights suddenly, the soft halo of apparent souls moving, channelers written in sleep, all these phenomena happens. I saw a body of light and I was completely awaked and I saw that Sheddims ( souls without physical body mentioned in the Kabbalah), a body just of light where the rainbow of colors swirled. This phenomena is explained in the Kabbalah. A psychiatrist have to be an objective person and allows people that have witnessed these phenomena not to become traumatized by them but on the contrary value them, enrich or strengthen by them and continue moving on ahead.
Trauma emotions can be removed and should be done because it is possible ‚ù§it&#39;s solely self work. I used to be sad and stuck in my head for over 30 years and finally now freed and happy ‚ù§üòä‚ù§
It&#39;s interesting that till the point the experts were sharing the techniques of their individual expertise they seemed very precise and certain. But soon as the conversation came to the collective result of their work, they started rambling. The experts might have charted parts of the brain and the mind and have come to understand the two as units of form and function but they still have very little understanding of the combined processes of the two. And if you really want to see them perplexed, just look at them the moment the word  &quot;consciousness&quot; was thrown into the mix. That word is the Achilles heal of neurosciences.

Thank you very much for the remarkable discussion on memory, indeed it was a complex process (at the end of discussion, does it pointing on human&#39;s soul?). And actually, I have question, beside organic trauma which could affect the human memory, is that possible that the brain/memory it selves get injured by psychologic trauma? and how this could be explained through molecular basis?... Based on my own experience, huge lies impact on my memory and as consequences conflicted with the identity. And also, is that possible our memory already made before our birth? and if it is possible, how it could be?....any answer are welcomed....

A long line of kids walked in single file in a great big room to where a nun sat with a tennis racket. What was going on? Each crying kid was laid across her lap and whacked once, then hurried out a side door. It was 1943.

Years later figured out the whack aimed to keep kids afraid and quiet. <br>It was dark  and warm when Mom and Dad picked us up. He carried the baby. She had to be there, but I don&#39;t remember seeing my sister with us. We passed a streetlight that brightened the sidewalk briefly. I felt happy to be going home. We must have taken a bus. No car.

Trotted past dark dressers to  bright windows with closed curtained blinds, a couch and chairs. Brr cold in diapers, a shirt, and bare feet. Satisfied, I quickly turned back and closed the door behind me. First memory.

Not only memories mark a section of life we lived, but emotions also do to. Emotions and mind can also write the script for your life story, and it happens quickly too. Especially when angry or in time of sadness. Once the mind is made up, and those emotions distills in us, the solutions running through our minds tend to get to the point where action is taken.

In adition to the vast value of people&#39;s opportunity to receive an overview of what memories actually envolves, there&#39;s here also a great contribution from Veronica O&#39;Keane that could perhaps just as much in particular relate to people who are dealing with issues of the so called &quot;borderline psychotic&quot; kind then to those severily stuck with ever returning and lasting psychotic experiences involved with particular kinds of scizofrenia, in that where the psychosis obviously differs greatly from the latter, while on the surface tending to become exposed along with quite obvious discharges that are bound to disturb within the surroundings, it seems somewhat easily forgotten that the exposed and obviously suffering individual may what self concerns at the moment be particularly vulnerable to further trauma, and perhaps even to just as &quot;life eating&quot; trauma. There are experienses with possibly countertherapeutic forms of interaction followed by severe levels of medication over extensive periods of time that if not only being more then somewhat telling of misenterpretation may also involve the sorts of misconceptions that are related to a possibly far fetched understanding what relations mild forms of psychosis and trauma betweens concerns. <br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This is and was to many in parts a hard world in which indifference, for instance, may at times be a great advantage to some where an emotionally statured mind may become severily expensive, and so perhaps at times a bit speedy, if are there in accordance with O&#39;Keane&#39;s contributions hopes of reaching the missed calm that may establish entrances of interaction? (Alternatively to the otherwise severe amounts of lost time, of cause, while not forgetting either the works of explosive forms of behavior on us all is indeed realised.) <br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Proportions, and not unneccessary waste, which is what I somewhat happily presume in the end to keep partly as mantras and luckily to some extents as reminders while various suggestions and claims involving what later stands not only as misconceptions but in part also as such along with indifference above what &quot;there are others about&quot; may serve to have one ignore, while each and every contribution to a possible &quot;this day is a new day&quot; must be treated and remembered as the priceless parts of a life that may be one&#39;s own, gets one to get that at place in the end. It&#39;s not at all and not what so ever &quot;everything that doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger,&quot; but rather, &quot;didn&#39;t it kill you, then live with it, and you may still get to become surprised by what various forms and shapes of joy that you were about to miss.&quot;

If memories of sensory experience can modify our DNA as explained in this video, then can thought-as a product of memory--modify specific DNA? For example, could humans self-modify its own DNA through a collective desire, let&#39;s say, to have fewer toes? and thereby possibly passing its now modified DNA unto its offspring? This means intentional mind-driven evolution rather than waiting for a random, non-needs based, mutated gene to come about.

The fact that Mr. Beast&#39;s videos get more views than videos like this one, is NOT a shame, BECAUSE programs such as Mr. Beast help produce dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins and adrenaline, instantly, which people get without using too many areas of their brains. Those are of immense importance during times of effortless mental crisis management.<br><br>But videos like this one, make use of our brain space and demand for our active participation towards truly driving us to the solution of a problem, being part of which, not everyone has the patience for. <br><br>Usually when people lose something/ SOMEONE of great importance in their lives, they instantly run towards a dopamine/ adrenaline/ oxytocin boost. Then when they&#39;re somewhat satisfied, they get back into their normal routine. Whereas, very few people who still chase after the solution, tend to stick to videos like this one.<br><br>Neuroscience and related topics are NOT for people with standard IQ to understand or work on. Thus these videos will always have fewer THOUGH more intense audience, who NEVER STOP chasing after THAT solution.
None of them know or talk about how exactly recall memory comes up in our mind. Is it because of patterns of photons stored in hippo? Or vibrations?

When your organ including Brian, if you don‚Äôt use, it will Fade away, including walk,
But if you loose power, you will stuck.
If you know what I am in social media, you will surprise, I just answered your programs.
They don‚Äôt know, while you young under 10 years you will easily to learn new things and remember mostly you did. So it‚Äôs good age to learn languages or anything you like to learn, but as your ages growing before 25 years old, you will have knowledge to judge and choosing good thing or favorite things to do. But as your getting older, you will gradually remember things, or if you just watch TV didn‚Äôt use your brain thinking, your brain will loose brains cells unless you keeps learning new things, will develop or increase brain cells, but like dance if you older you still need dances over 3 times to remember that. But while your body might be tired, no enough sleep, don‚Äôt have energy. Talk about last night programs, I have 3 days go to that programs, didn‚Äôt sleep enough, eat meals, and those world conflicts two parties fighting, no way to solved that problem, and force me back up, in these situations I just sleep two hours last night. What do you expect, I am 70 years old, I have my Physical Therapy Aide Diploma with highest honors awarded. I have many year‚Äôs experience in the every areas.

Fascinating! I stumbled upon this video and I&#39;m so glad I took the time to watch it all.
Thank you for bringing this interesting topic to the table&#39;s surface.  All of you made this potentially complicated topic regarding memory/brain brilliantly comprehendable ... Thank you again.
I remember from i whas 3days old
Has anyone else noticed that the conscious observer within us has been unchanged since our earliest memories?
An interesting follow up might be the impact of technology such as asocial media and AI on the brain and behavior.
What does cognitive behavioral therapy do at the molecular level?
We clearly do not yet really understand at the molecular level how memory is stored and recalled in the brain
To all involved with this video from the narrator and writers and the artists and videographer and all the scientist , fantastic job well done making a the subject matter easy to comprehend and enjoyable. The voice of the narrator keeping me interested. Surely this won awards and deservedly so.
Great learning today. Thank you so much for the molecular level discussion.
So what i got from the 38+ minute segment, is basically to some degree confirming that memory is stored in the DNA. In form of binary 1s and 0s regarding if it&#39;s &quot;up or down&quot;. I might be over simplifying it but it&#39;s my take. I know Gregg Braden has written a book(The God Code) on this subject. Though I&#39;m not familiar off hand with his explanation.
I loved every minute of this. It&#39;s really fascinating to hear and try and understand the way our brains work.

It‚Äôs why your emotional reaction to an event can change over time (think of a bad break-up/being cheated on, and good/bad memories twisting).  I think that‚Äôs important in addition to meta-encoding at the post-synaptic level (amount of dopamine vs nonciceptin).

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2535">42:15</a> Quite awkward comments from a Head of a lab. <br><br>98% of the human genome don&#39;t produce RNAs with CONSISTENT functions. There is transcription (outstanding in its scale, but still not &quot;98%&quot;) looking more like a result of non-specific RNA polymerase activity. The important thing to understand is that the term &quot;regulatory RNA&quot; refers to an RNA with a particular set of functions consistently transcribed from the same gene. It&#39;s not just bits and pieces of RNA appearing at random from different places of the genome. A massive unspecific transcription &quot;with a function&quot; also undermines the notion of the transcriptome that defines different cell types. <br><br>Also, the term &quot;encode&quot; implies the use of the genetic code. That code is relevant only for messenger RNAs, NOT for regulatory RNAs that don&#39;t encode amino acids. So the genome cannot encode regulatory RNAs. Actually, they are also called &quot;non-coding&quot; RNAs. <br><br>By different estimations, we have about 200,000 different transcripts (RNAs), of which 20,000 code for proteins (PMID: 30124169). Protein-coding genes constitute 2% of the genome.

This is fascinating, the first time I have seen a plausible (albeit superficial) explanation for how thought and memory work. However, I do not share the idea that this is reductive, or somehow diminishes what we are.<br>We are made of the elemental forces of the universe, arranged into patterns that can expirence and contemplate its very existence. Then to further know that these patterns are the result of universal causation that traces back throughout time to the very moment of creation. If you think that a better understanding of how our bodily systems work, somehow diminishes what we are, then you do not fully grasp what you are.<br>Also consider that the universe appears to be (and is almost certainly), infinite. In that case every pattern will inevitably repeat, and not just once, but throughout infinity.<br>This implies that the perception we are separate finite beings, is in fact an illusion. We are far more than the some of our parts, and in more ways than we can possibly imagine. If these facts don&#39;t convince you, and fill you with awe and wonder, you&#39;re not paying attention.

I can remember Monday on Tuesday well, come Thursday I&#39;m not gonna know. I can prime a memory with a note/picture for months and when I stop it will be swept away. I couldn&#39;t recognize my daughter, friends, boyfriend shaved his face, he looked familiar but no memory came forward. If I close my eyes and listen/ed to their voice I&#39;m in a better position. This started in 2015 I&#39;m 37y/o
i hate people who have needs to access others memories. they are evil and abusive know the facts on that.

It&#39;s really misleading to claim that energy is transferred in neural signaling, it&#39;s really quite minimal, there&#39;s no current, only an &#39;action potential&#39;, a wave of ion flows in and out of the cell essentially transverse to the direction of the signal.

Assalamualaikum sir üíìüíìüíìüíìüíì
Awesome program! Thanks to the experts for their professional explanations, which solved my hard thinking. Hopefully what I have learned from you will help you too.<br><br>What is consciousness?<br>The subconscious information of the network of neurons is decoded or encoded by the thalamus, and the resulting electrochemical substance is consciousness.<br><br>Consciousness, subconsciousness, and deep consciousness are subjective distinctions created by the interaction of various organizational structures in the human brain.<br><br>Our consciousness is like an electrochemical flow, divided into conscious stream, subconscious stream and deep conscious stream. Transfer information electrochemically between neuronal networks.<br><br>But we cannot perceive the deep stream of consciousness, luckily we all know what we are thinking. That is, we all know our consciousness, so when the subconscious information of the network of neurons is decoded or encoded by the thalamus, the resulting electrochemical substance is consciousness.
Thank you so much
Absolutely love the channel and this particular show. With this one and a few more I have noticed that towards the end, discussion reaches a point where there is no answer. I think that is where they need to have a couple of practitioners from spirituality such as vedantic scholars or monks that have done years of meditation. I love the modern science and gadgets and tests that discover new facts. The spiritualists can take it to the next level and show that it&#39;s not just that perception is reality but in fact reality is a perception.
That was incredible. I particularly liked the bit piece towards the end, where Veronica made reference to that feeling we all have on occasion - when we sense something other than ourselves (in her words, consciousness looking back at us) - because it is reminiscent of a recent talk given by two well-known Dzogchen masters during which one of them described a meditation practice where the meditator would - in effect - throw their consciousness into a corner and have it look back at them. Great discussion guys. Thank you üôè
Interesting.Thank you
My first memory is around 2-3 years age... I lost myself in the back of my house.
I got bored at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2760">46:00</a> how far did you get?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=5023">1:23:43</a> dude, what she says here made so much sense. Us being aware of ourselves to this extent and looking at ourselves is the illusion of there being something more. More conscious things must be capable of becoming aware of this illusion too?
Could have been a great presentation but died from the boredom of the quests.

Thanks Brian and WSF for these wonderful and educative videos. I have been a great fan of your writing for well over a decade. I have also been a subscriber to this channel for many years now, Have watched your documentaries and loved them. These videos with the brilliant guests you have are absolutely a breath of fresh air for someone like me with a curious mind. It‚Äôs staggering that we live in a time when such content is widely available at minimal monetary cost if that. Thanks for this brilliant content and wish you all the best.
I feel like the panelists missed the mark in answering some of Greene&#39;s questions, but it was definitely a great episode.
I am a happy and very contented ignorant with a very peaceful and fullfiling life. I just heard cakling in a chicken yard. <br>So stupid I am I did not learn how to cakle with the video.
Great discussion until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=88">1:28</a> mark and one of the guests (Tim Bredy) says that if we lean on technology more it frees up creativity. Although this guest was extremely knowledgable, I don&#39;t think he understands the roots of something like creativity. Creativity is not based on a clear path of thinking, but it&#39;s based rather on just the opposite - the energy and identity forces at work when our path of thinking is blocked, repressed, etc.
A great discussion although from my POV I would have liked more talk on the use of implantable, synthetic devices for memory storage and BCIs for &quot;off site&quot; memory storage / computation.  My organisations The Neural Archives Foundation, has particular interests in a number of the points that were discussed but primarily how this stored information might be recovered from frozen neural tissue.<br><br>Also, as usual, Brian did a great job leading the discussion!  Well done everyone!

Admittedly dated, but I am reading Carl Sagan‚Äôs The Dragons of Eden.  He talks about the structure of our brains and speculates on the origins of the right and left hemispheres.  He speculates that originally they were redundant.  Doing the same thing. But as humans evolved one of the hemispheres evolved to do rational thinking.  He reminds us that the Greeks used geometry, shapes to perform mathematics, using the right hemisphere of the brain long before humans used numbers using the left hemisphere.  Mathematics today is taught using shapes as well as numbers integrating the right and left hemisphere‚Äôs of the brain.  Maps and multiplication are still quite relevant in the opinion of this writer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=84">1:24</a> The Theory of Semantic Molecules. :D
Sounds like Rebecca the memory girl might try a mild GABA agonist to censor her memory somewhat.
Is memory just factual imagination? This does have the advantage of defining it as a subset of imagination, not considered similar to memory.
&quot;Recalling the memory to now is like imagining it in a different spacetime location.&quot;
I know what I experienced there‚Äôs no mystery
I don&#39;t remember who I am or where I am or what this is or what that is!  üò∂
What makes us human? God did! <br><br>The theory of evolution does not have the logistics. Epigenetic-derived adaptations take as little as two generations to set new adaptations, such as factually in finches. Your evolution mentors postulate it takes over 2 million years as with the Darwin Finches. If epigenetics does it in just 17 years, then why would genetic-based evolution have to kick in 2 million? <br><br>There are FIVE information codes in every cell, aside from blood cells. The five are the DNA code, the mtDNA code, the epigenome code, the &#39;sugar&#39; code that lines the surface of every cell, and the lipid code making up cell membranes. All these had to work in unison. The makeup of these for life are mathematical impossibilities-by-chance. To say the ribosome sums up evolution is ludicrous.    That is defined as a 10^50 or more. It&#39;s far too complex without outside intelligence to make it happen. On top of this, the Intelligent Designer is a master chemist with 65 different hormones in the human body. We are a creation.. Not an evolution.<br><br>Quite simply everyone, there is a biological system already in place...therefore  God-engineered, logistically...doing all of the classic adaptations. What is this biological system? It&#39;s called the epigenome. It&#39;s actions is called epigenetics. This includes adaptations seen in Darwin Finches without any natural selection of DNA mutations. Instead it&#39;s modifications by chemical tagging turning genes up and down or on and off for different structures such as new beaks for new diets. This is FAST...doing its job in just 2 generations, not millions of years by &#39;evolution&#39;. Evolution is a scam folks. We are an intelligent design by Jesus Christ. This means he offers a free gift of eternal life just for believing in it and believing he resurrected. Take the free gift today!!!
Wow, that was alot of uninteresting, false, reigious bs, lame enough to be included in that book of rubbish you people love so much

My first memory is under a tree at a free festival... not sure if it was stonehendge or Glastonbury (I don&#39;t remember üòÖ) but I have a vivid memory of being under a tree, in a buggie, in the shade and our family dog was watching over me...that&#39;s it! But it remains vivid and I have later discovered that when I was &lt;1 years old we had a heatwave in the UK (1976) which wss a rare occasion back then.. this makes me feel that it is a real memory and not just one of the many festivals I attended as the kid of hippies üòä its was reinforced when I asked my mum (at maybe 20+) she was baffled that I remembered how sunny and hot that time was... but who knows, it feels real - even though I still struggle to recall last week ü§≠
It‚Äôs very interesting that approaching my 40 I started to dream my past experiences - it‚Äôs like coming back memory of my birth- literally the peak of struggle reaching the light, other past lives in strong action moments- short but so vivid and clear dreams/memories üòÖ..

I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. They&#39;re are various pharmaceutical and talk therapies that could help. One of which is EMDR therapy (or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) which doesn&#39;t try to forget your memory but more or less turn down the emotions and feelings that accompany those memories. I hope you can get the help you need!
Very nice sir hi ji
Very important topic, love to learn and study human brains!!
&quot;God is all around you, you&#39;re just looking for Him with your head instead of with your heart. You cannot see that God is everywhere because you&#39;re looking for Him with your eyes instead of with your soul. You cannot feel God&#39;s presence inside you because you&#39;re looking for Him out in the world. You cannot know God&#39;s truth because you cannot know the mind of God&quot; <i>et al, ad infinitum!</i><br><br>It seems to me that as to believe in God is purely an act of faith - that is to say, one can <i>only</i> come to believe in God via subjective, rather than objective, measures - that when this fact is considered in tandem with the capacity for imaginative sophistry that is unique to the human mind,  there is simply no argument that could ever be constructed disproving God&#39;s existence in our world. With every argument I&#39;ve ever heard in favour of atheism, it is almost trivial to imagine a counter-argument that could be used against it, in favour of theism. No matter that the plurality of these counter-arguments then become self-contradictory, and thus incoherent, for once again this understanding of logic (by humans) can always then be argued against on &quot;unknowability&quot; grounds. &quot;God is mysterious, who are we to say He should be apprehendable to our minds&quot; etc. etc., <i>ad infinitum.</i> It will always be a case of defence by circular reasoning. <i>Reductio ad absurdum.</i> <br><br>And so the atheists cause looks utterly hopeless. The war had been lost even before the first rhetorical shot had been fired. Quite simply, God&#39;s existence in our world cannot ever be refuted... <br><br>...not in <i>our</i> (human) world, anyway. But there are a good deal many creatures than simply humans in the wider world. Indeed, when considering <i>all</i> creatures, both great and small, to have ever existed the number of &#39;non-human beings&#39; simply swamp the &#39;being&#39; kind. And applying human sophistry in explaining the issue of the existence, and suffering, of animals, suddenly begins to look like a <b><i>much, much</i></b> more difficult project to sustain. <br><br>Because... Why? <br><br>Why, what possible reason could an omnipotent, omniscient, omni-benevolent creator have in creating so much seemingly unnecessary suffering? Why?<br><br>It may well be that theists will simply wave their hands around a little, as though clutching at the air, then simply shrug their shoulders and look to the sky&#39;s again. But, when considering the totality of suffering experienced by the animals of this Earth, literally, the &#39;lambs of God&#39;, well, the usual human sophistry defences (&quot;who are we to know the creator&#39;s mind?&quot;) suddenly don&#39;t seem so unassailable. In fact, they don&#39;t look defensible <i>at all.</i> <br><br>...thoughts.
I would like to know, how so many words could be used in your statement, without really saying anything at all, and remember, short is sweet
Excuse me but the double helix was discovered by Rosalind Franklin, whose results were stolen by Watson and Crick. Better not to perpetuate history mistakes
Science definitely gives new way of thinking üòä
I am happy to have seen this... we have come a long way in chunking down the mechanics; if scientific method holds, next we can conduct experiments to see an actual emotional orchestration of the brain in color.
In my view, science is focusing on the wrong place to locate the source(s) of memory: <br><br>our individual BODIES instead of the common to all EARTH.<br><br>To render knowledge suitable for practical application to satisfy needs of beings it is essential that we first describe how an ideal system of life on this earth SHOULD function before analyzing any phenomenon. <br><br>And then analyze the reason(s) why the current state of that phenomenon deviates from that ideal in order to rectify it.<br><br>In that sense, it is ideal that the sources of memory be inside the earth and our need perceptions (hunger, fear, pain) occur only when any deviation from that ideal state happens inside the earth, and those sources require our intervention to restore that ideal state.<br><br>The above mentioned ideal state is:<br><br>when a being feels hungry it automatically knows where ~ on which plant ~  to find the food, or when it feels fear or probable pain it also knows what action to take on which plant to prevent it before the given threat factualizes.<br><br>So all search for knowledge MUST be restricted to discovering the functions of plants as results of particle interactions inside the earth to compose and sustain them. <br><br>A TASK FOR PARTICLES PHYSICS.<br><br>Hence BIOLOGY, and of course all other so called SOCIAL SCIENCES, must automatically follow from the mathematical model of the particle physical mechanism how plants grow due to particle interactios inside the core of the earth that compose seeds, water and fertilizers (= the air).<br><br>That means all beings are to be seen as RCD (Remote Control Devices) that process the air (fertilizer) the earth delivers in order to rectify the errors in its internal function experienced by the individual being as NEED requiring action on unique plants for each being to satisfy it.<br><br>Thus, life function itself can be formulated mathematically as:<br><br>N   =    f(S)<br><br>where N is the feeling of need in the being formulated as unique combination of particles,<br><br>and S the correponding means for its satisfaction formulated similarly as relevant combination of other particles to be grown on plants.<br><br>Instead of trying to understand nature&#39;s purpose of phenomena, we MUST concentrate on our own purpose of SUSTENANCE OF PLEASANT LIFE FUNCTION in it, and look for ways to factualize that purpose assuming nature permits it, for if it is not the case, then there is absolutely no point in wasting time, efforts and funds to collect knowledge.
Alot of words, yet nothing said

In my opinion, one of the best WSF episodes ever! Terrific panel of guests.
This was a good one, however they should of had sapolsky on
Excellent discussion and Brian Greene always asks excellent questions. It would be interesting to ask the panel what their thoughts are about AI Superintelligence.
Hell yeahhh! It is alive!
As always, this is just another piece of gerat knowledge festival... However, I have to say that there is always a pretty feelable sense of stage fright among almost all of the speakers and the host. <br>I am always on alert for BRIAN GREENE`s work-of-art type topics and discussions on world science festival because I learn and get fantastic insights from the top notch professors and academics about the things that I am both personally and professionally interested in. <br>Perhaps, I should not say that but I feel somehow compelled to express what I was kind of given by watching this discussion that is, I think, if these discussions on World Science Festival, are not made  in front of live audience, instead, if BRIAN GREENE hosts these great festivals like in the times, when he was hosting it alone sitting alone infront of windows  through each of which there was a scientist speaking with BRIAN GREENE,,, it would be marvelous because only then both the host and the speakers are feeling at the best level of comfort,,,, I know.... everone who is familiar with human behaviour, consciousness and language, is certainly realized that the stage fright is present in such discussions and it also hampers the level of productivity, level of questions, better insights and so on.......... I think I have made it clearer, at least, to those who think the same and wish the same. Hopefully, this great show would be hosted in a more intimate atmosphere, not in front of a live audiance and also the audiance hampers the producivaty of such discussions too is not that so ?...... because clearly, not everbody is keen on many details  and what is really going on in the discussion..... <br>Best regards to all the speakers and of course to BRIAN GREENE he is a real giant in the realm of science, we are really too luck to have him among us in this era.
My earliest memory, ~ 2.5 yrs?, was of me in a crib (1st person; can picture the bottom of the crib set off the floor, bars, etc), and my mother leaving the room.  Then shortly thereafter looking through the bars I see a spider - vague image, but lots of little legs and a body heading towards me  on the floor.  I scream ‚ÄúMommy mommy‚Äù, freaking out, until she comes back, by which time the spider had crawled under the crib and disappeared!  I am even more freaked out because I don‚Äôt know where it is, but with minimal language skills, cannot explain why I am screaming.  My mother tries to convince me everything is all right, and leaves.  Don‚Äôt remember much after that.  Two points.  (1) that was the first time (as far as I know) I saw a spider - and still I went ballistic.  (2) I remember a minute or so before seeing the spider as part of the memory.  This is VERY important, as it means that what was in working memory was also recorded with the memory.  Without the earlier memory, you may not be able to predict a dangerous situation if it repeats.  That is not relevent in this situation, but could be in may others.  As for (1), a Columbian friend says he is ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù to react to a ball with 8 lines radiating out (symbolic of a spider) and even drawing a circle and 8 lines on a chalk board generates an adrenalin spike in him.
When you &quot;figure it out&quot; all on your own, the emotional euphoria released ensures you will remember.<br><br>Don&#39;t copy off your neighbor.
I have so many questions.  How are these researchers turning on and off a person&#39;s ability to retrieve their own memories?  Can a person&#39;s individual awareness or consciousness be &quot;&quot;erased&quot;, so that they are not themselves?  How long can a person&#39;s emotions be &quot;turned off&quot; before any lasting damage occurs?
Wait... So thinking happy thoughts alters Dna...
Concepts as I understand them are a representations of what humans not fully understand but at the same time they acknowledge its existence even if only mentally,‚Ä¶etc <br>usually it‚Äôs something agreed on its existence, but may not be agreed on its essence (ambiguity)‚Ä¶<br>to concise it‚Äôs a concept till they agreed on its essence!
they want to specify location and momentum at the same time at subatomic level too! they can not deal with time as a process the same way at subatomic level !second derivative to time !  it is possible to reach high certainty even at subatomic level too, but that will never happen before deep understanding of the fundamentals of physics such as space, time, constants, ‚Ä¶. and connecting units firstly (much harder scientific work),  they even can not recognize yet that time is a process ! Dirac‚Äôs wonder (LNH) is real (future generations have to connect both levels (subatomic and cosmological levels), to be able to understand what is going on.<br>(Everything is governed by science and only science and statistics is an approach that could work in deterministic field before they eventually can figure out that it‚Äôs deterministic too.
The idea that memories are somehow stored in the brain is one of the greatest lies of all time. It&#39;s in fact IMPOSSIBLE for the neuronal brain to act as the storehouse of memories. A depolarisation is immediately followed by a repolarisation in milliseconds thus rendering even working memory IMPOSSIBLE.
Well their not stored in your big toe, or the elbow, so then where ??
@@psycho6542 They&#39;re not stored in the brain at all. They can&#39;t be. It&#39;s a lie.
üòä wow thank you all !!
This was great, particularly the bit about RNA function in synaptic plasticity - perhaps this is why some instinct (learned lessons from one lifetime) can be passed to offspring. Do you think even our understanding of 3D space/shape was learned via evolution and passed on in DNA? I think some memories are triggered by what 3D shape we are currently attending to, and what shapes from memory may be similar (that there is a mechanism for triggerability via proximity/likeness in perceptual space). For example, once when attending to my torso while lying in bed, I had a memory flash of my torso while driving a Volvo, but the road going towards ceiling for torso in memory to align with torso of current attention.
Attending your torso?
@@malindabrowning9240yes, like my chest- for most people the constant locational shifts of their attention escape their conscious observation, but if you learn to pay attention, the brain must &#39;render&#39; even inertial forces and internal movements of balance and adjustment.
These descriptions and explanations are splendid, yet they keep changing as more measuring devices are made. Associations to human feelings are dynamic, non-linear and context-depending.<br>It does keep learners occupied in comprehending the terminologies and flow of logic in making some sense of the data collected by devices and by observations.<br>Difficulty of such pursuits does not make it superior. Functionality in mitigating real problems make it more relevant. Issues are on-going and has no solution. Only problem statements have solutions. So the pertinent question is, &quot;What problem, if any, is it going to solve?&quot;.
I can remember what happened but I  can&#39;t see myself even I was there, do you know what I mean!!
this is a very difficult subject and I could tell that our guests were always clear with their answers.
With Brian Greene at helm, you can be sure that the talk would be high quality and interesting. However I would have wanted to hear a bit more on the exact mechanics of memory formation and retrieval, involving neurons and circuits. The talk was more general.
This was such a beautiful conversation
Since this subject has far reaching implications... I&#39;d like to take a minute and point out something very important that needs to be addressed as well. A personalized individual digital database creation combined with neural augmentation that entrains the brain and uses it like a sensory organ versus allowing natural neurological synapses and processes is NOT consciousness nor memory. The essence that makes a person is NOT present in that digital imitation fake a brain IARPA. Do you realize the Military calls people under computer control Flesh Puppets? Human Nodes on a Network like equipment? What makes us human is NOT transferrable in those digitized creations.

He told me he that now he was doubting if he was even an historical person with a propper mail address: &quot;All these stories lie in a bit of a messy fog...&quot;. Jesus today seemed in quite a desperate mood. 500.000 germans have resigned the church this year alone. Something to do with many thousandfold abuses of authority. But I ask myself: Why do you bring up death and debt in context of a a fantastic science-show that enlights us on the majestic gravity of the neurobiology of human memory?
Imagine a bunch of highly corrupt psychologists (contract psychopaths) over a prolonged period constantly trying to grove terrible memories in you as a targeted process of making your worldview models pathetic and nonsensical.
Surely a memorable episodic memory is formed of this episode on memory.

I remember being put in the crib during the daytime and experiencing how the sunlight was glowing an orange red color through my thin baby eyelids,, and thinking about how I was breathing.<br>Later in my life I remembered that as I was starting to be able to breath through my mouth on demand, and how I could switch from using my nose and then my mouth, because there was this sensation in my nasal cavity that I was feeling and controlling.<br><br>Many years later, I found out this only happens in about the first 9 months of life.<br>I definitely remember being a baby.<br><br>I also remember what I now can call the great forgetting period, and I sort of argued with my mother, around the age of 4, that I had a harder time remembering things from before and she told me I couldn&#39;t remember those things, and yet I described some things that I obviously still remembered, and she said,  oh your just reinforcing those memories from pictures or stories, but Noooooo, I remember from inside my head and my own eyes, what I was experiencing, and pictures could only help, but not be the cause of these memories of breathing and controlling my nasal vs mouth breathing.
Are you hyperphantasiac by any chance? You can imagine things with as much clarity as your real visual sight? Just curious.
What if the brain only keeps the thumbnails while the actual memory is not local? The experience is used to power Evolution, like a collective vault we call Nature. This is because build instructions is not in DNA.
Our identity is just memory

For many years human was writing for the sake of future generations and science while the sick irrational thief apes were busy with stealing and polluting human thoughts then erasing human traces (systematically), they wanted to maintain their faked imaginary irrational realm!
This not actual reality (far more complicated than that), but just to make it easier to comprehend: you can imagine cycle two (this existence), is the software that generates this universe (cycle one which built within cycle two).<br>This was written many years ago (respond) <br>It was about how human at the end will find out that they are already on the top of one of the most advanced technology in existence itself,‚Ä¶.etc
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=5160">1:26:00</a> even regarding current computers, hardware is the medium that softwares work through!<br>what if it was reversed ?! software is what creates hardware and uses it (the details were written many years ago, one of the irrational thieves has stolen and polluted human thoughts, could be many other irrational thieves did)!<br>this is just an analogy (approach), the reality is far more complicated than that.
Our software creates hardware  , applies only to living creatures .<br>The interesting thing about it is that our brain can be likened to a country. The more developed the country is, the more roads and highways can be seen, the same goes for the brain
Current accumulated scientific knowledge isn‚Äôt enough even to‚Ä¶.. !<br><br>Humans have not even climbed the first step on the ladder of science, and humans will not open the gate to science before a deep understanding of the fundamentala of physics such as space, constants, ‚Ä¶ and gravity.
To reach cycle two that requires deciphering gravity (deep understanding), but gravity has nothing to do with consciousness type one at all (some irrational thieves had wrong interpretations of what they have stolen).<br>space is one indivisible unit (current understanding of space, gravity, constants,‚Ä¶etc) is wrong.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4980">1:23:00</a> to say something beyond physics is not the proper understanding (nothing would come into existence without science whatsoever), it‚Äôs beyond current physics (related to cycle two but governed by science and science).<br>consciousness type one is one of the most important secrets in existence itself.<br>current accumulated scientific knowledge isn‚Äôt enough at all.<br>to concise: what generates both personal identity and consciousness type one is self concept (no one can break human thoughts ‚Äúimpossible ‚Äú)<br>but mankind is up to it, it could take up to two thousands of years of continuous scientific work by real rational intelligent human scientists.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4920">1:22:00</a> matter (human brain) can yield consciousness type one because it‚Äôs a process that requires human brain (in this case), consciousness type one is the key for mankind to decipher both consciousness type one and type two.<br>even though at the end self concept (one of the most advanced coding systems in existence itself), but it‚Äôs possible to decipher consciousness type one.
Humans painted their memories on the walls of the caves and texts too since thousands of years ago (no real difference).
Memory is important to keep personal identity coherent (it‚Äôs a process).
Here you find the explanation of why Time is a process not a dimension, you have to read till the end to be able to understand: There‚Äôs a difference between Time is the measurement and Time is a process l, because time is the process of measurement (that is why they couldn‚Äôt understand what time is till this moment ), clock hands (minutes and hours) are the reference (memory) the calculation of seconds (The tick of the clock, and oscillation in atomic clocks )  is present time (future in clocks has different approach, clock itself doesn‚Äôt recognise future)<br>to concise the whole process is time (it‚Äôs a PROCESS)<br>in human brain the whole process in clocks takes place but humans have memory and can anticipate future (next step based on previous experiences or calculations but in clocks they have fixed pace unless something happens to seconds hand ) so in human brain there‚Äôs a whole process (ticking or oscillation, processing ‚Äúincluding cognition ‚Äú and memory.<br>in human brain the processing itself is the present time and the result of processing is the past time ‚Äúin memory‚Äù.<br>in pysics it requires space to calculate time, but in human brain probably works at level close to Planck‚Äôs length,. in human brain there are more than one clock, one is very accurate such as how humans reach perfecrion in shooting, and other games, and inacurate clock that works in conscious experience (daily life) and that is more effective (no need for high accuracy). clocks can‚Äôt recognise time but human brain can. there‚Äôs action but could be quantum action or possible mental action in the brain too (but very likely Quantum action) (so-called Quantum action could be the minimum action). talking about space here is in the classical physics (normal equations where we calculate speed and distance) but that is the core of clocks in general (time = distance / speed) the shift in seconds hand.  but there‚Äôs minimum action (Planck‚Äôs scale). mental clock requires action too but different approach. to concise human brain can recognise time unlike clocks (it‚Äôs a process). Planck is one of the best former scientists.<br><br>Hopefully the idea is clear, I hardly can focus.<br><br>I think the idea is that time is a bit complicated: why do you need the minute hand and the hour hand? Because time is a process and not just the ticking of the seconds hand, here I am talking about the conventional scale of ordinary clocks , and I am not talking about the scale of atomic clocks, but it is the same idea at the end. but there‚Äôs a big difference: clocks can‚Äôt recognise the ticks of seconds hand but humans can.<br><br>There‚Äôs a mental clock for sure: it‚Äôs the result of continuous approximate calculations of dimensions and speed, it‚Äôs inaccurate but very effective in usual daily activities such as: is that narrow road is enough to my car to pass through?!, but there‚Äôs other type of time which is very accurate and very likely based on physical clock similar to atomic clocks.<br><br>to reach perfection in some shooting sports (repeatable) indicate that there is a very accurate clock (probably more accurate than modern clocks), in human brain (very likely) it is in cerebellum, accompaned with  other accurate caluculqtions such as wind speed,‚Ä¶.etc. of course all that happen unknowingly.<br><br>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ <br>By the way, they hide or delete human valuable precious thoughts for theft purposes (many of the irrational thieves wrote books only out of human thoughts), they worked in a systematic collective theft and worked on erasing human traces).

1: 14:90 memory is just a small part of the whole process, but here you can connect what they have mentioned before about DNA to how humans acquired psychological traits through genes from their parents (far more complicated than that).<br>the process of generating personal identity is one of the most complicated process in human brain related to body, memory, environment, cultures,‚Ä¶.etc <br>but the phenomenon of transferring psychological traits via heart transplant is related to the same topic,‚Ä¶.etc.
I&#39;m not sure if this is what you are trying to say or imply, but if you&#39;re thinking that emotional or memory experiences of parents can effect the DNA of their future children, then that&#39;s simply not the case.  On the mother&#39;s side of things, the DNA in her ovum (eggs) is present at her birth and certainly isn&#39;t being changed.  On the fathers side, the DNA in the sperm he produces is also not being changed by any experience he has stored in his brain.  I also think you may have misunderstood what they meant when referencing to &quot;changes&quot; in DNA.  They are likely talking about gene expression, not actual physical changes in DNA sequences.  If this is not what you were implying, then please ignore my reply.
@@johnchappell4492 I don‚Äôt mean exactly what they said (that can‚Äôt maintain the state), but I talk about genes in general.<br>but they are unaware of what‚Äôs behind what they have noticed (their interpretations are incorrect).<br>there‚Äôs something else far more complicated than that (governed by science and only science).<br>it‚Äôs possible to make that as axioms (if you understand who you are then you will be able to recognise which psychological traits you acquired from your mother or your father and which are related to your own experience), it‚Äôs possible to turn that to axioms (just understand your personal identity).<br>to concise: it‚Äôs something else far more complicated but related to genes too, I think that will take at least few thousands of years of continuous scientific progress for mankind to figure out what is going on.
What they said can‚Äôt maintain the states in human brain especially rapidly changing states (there‚Äôs something else far more complicated behind that), what they mentioned can‚Äôt maintain a complete mental and psychological states for instance in the case of transferring psychological traits via heart transplantation.<br>(too early to figure out the mechanism behind maintaining the state in human brain).
I didn‚Äôt want to mention that directly but there is something else uses genes (very advanced coding systems), something else governed by science but very far from humans to grasp (could take up to thousands of years to recognise it).<br>they will figure that out as soon as they recognise that they can‚Äôt build living entity from scratch.<br>that has nothing to with so-called gods, ‚Ä¶..etc<br>but it‚Äôs science, humans can recognise that as soon as they decipher gravity (gravity has nothing to do with that directly, but it will open the gate to reach cycle two).<br>it‚Äôs not good to mention that but (everything is governed by science and only science ‚Äûnothing would come into existence without science whatsoever ‚Äû). to concise: what they said can‚Äôt maintain rapidly and continuously changing states in human brain but there‚Äôs something else uses genes and can maintain the states.
It‚Äôs not easy to comprehend but this could help: they think that starting from one cell then go to the miracle (they give that ambiguous names such as complexity,‚Ä¶..etc), at the same time they claim that they don‚Äôt believe in so-called gods and miracles but at the same time they want things to take place miraculously!<br>everything is governed by science and only science but this existence is far more complicated than that!<br>there are no miracles: nothing will happen miraculously such as  turning complexity into miracles! there‚Äôs something else far more advanced and governed by science (nothing would come into existence without science whatsoever), there‚Äôs evolution but the interpretations are wrong, it‚Äôs possible to start from simple to become more complicated and advanced at the same time in cycle two but cycle one (this universe) never started simple at all (evolution does exist but their interpretations to evolution and life is completely wrong).
It went to far to reach so-called ontology but maintaining the state is important part of what they interpret as life (life is related to cycle two not to cycle one)<br>this universe (cycle one) is built within cycle two (this existence), very likely space is one indivisible unit (current understanding of space is wrong) and how some constants solved the problem of infinity, ‚Ä¶.. etc indicate that this universe never came into existence by a mere chance (complexity that leads to miracles doesn‚Äôt exist !) <br>this universe built within cycle two for sure, I think that humans need 400 to 2 thousands of years to recognise that (solid scientific evidences).

I was very impressed with your guests.  Certainly surprised of my own level of understanding the concepts expressed in your discussion. Thank you, most informative.  As always Dr. Brian Greene does not disappoint.
Brainiacs want to deal with things like memory with some kind of advanced technology because they don&#39;t know how to do it naturally, but the fact is that memories are dependent on one&#39;s perception of the past. Change your perception of the past, and the memory changes. Memories are also depending on how you evolve in the future. Change into a different person and your perception of reality will change and therefore your perception of memories will change. There&#39;s no one on the earth who understands this better than me. If you want to have a proper discussion about memory, and what kind of education people need to get in order to heal their negative memories and transform themselves into healthy and positive people, the one that you need to interview is me. As you wish, Brian Green. üôèüèª

Awesome range of views. Somewhere along I imagined the &quot; synergy&quot; that takes form when Hydrogen and Oxygen give rise to water. I wonder if consciousness expresses it self in the synergy. That it happens invariably and repetitively suggests that the synergy isn&#39;t the cause but the expression by some law of this consciousness. All creatures therefore have this power. It is seemingly more pronounced and nuanced in man.... Thanks for this episode WSF.

To remember something is to create the memory. The moon is not there when you are not looking.
My first memory is from when I was in the back yard with my brothers and a German Shepherd (no surprises there...lol). The weird part is that when we left that house for a different house i was eighteen months old. <br>So I can remember something from when I was a toddler.
My son remembers being about three months old and we can vouch for this as he remembers the fridge being in the breakfast room, not in the kitchen. He can point it to its exact place and he&#39;s right. <br>I remember being in cot and crawling. I also remember sitting in my dad&#39;s slipper and pretending it was a boat. Then I looked up and my dad was so tall! <br>I have many memories of that kind, all from a very early age.
Unfortunately with all the respect to the experts I found the contribution a little poor. How ever B Green shone like always.

I find it a bit perplexing that people can assume, limit, their belief to thinking what we see and know is enough to explain something like consciousness or life. What we do know, if we look from a sufficient perspective of the whole, is that life repeats on all scales in all directions, and its safe to assume that we do not know all scales. This makes it hard to think that mind, consciousness, awareness is original, and limited to and a result of the brain as we understand it, that it isn&#39;t a version of something else, like a microcosm of something fundamental. Mind as far as we know is intrinsic to everything, because we cannot know anything without it, if it is intrinsic, then as nature does it must be intrinsic on other scales. Truth is with or without understanding, our job is to find the understanding that reveals truth, and not create truths that we can understand, because our understanding is always behind.
I agree and am mindful of all that exists that we are not aware of but should seek to find

No. It&#39;s not a shame. Programs such as Mr. Beast helps produce dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins and adrenaline, which people get without using too many areas of their brains.<br><br>But videos like this one, makes use of their brain space and demands for thir active participation towards truly driving them to the solution of a problem, being part of which, not everyone has the patience for. <br><br>Usually when people lose something/ SOMEONE of great importance in their lives, they instantly run towards a dopamine/ adrenaline/ oxytocin boost.

This may lead to existential crises: what if there‚Äôs a copy of me with exactly the same memory
There are infinite copies of you with exactly the same memory
Don&#39;t worry if there are infinite instances of you and me that have the exact same memories. All of them are causality isolated. It is the same if they don&#39;t exist at all. Sorry about my English. It&#39;s just another bad infinite repited memory haha
Then they would be in the same places you or they would have to hurt memories. <br><br>You are forming new memories right now and if they&#39;re the same as someone else&#39;s you would be them.<br><br>So it&#39;s impossible
Then that person  will also be in existential crisis
That would not happen because in the moment somebody exactly as you, with the same memories, exists in a different position in space from you, your personalities start to deviate and become different persons.When you look at him your watching maybe a house in the background and he may be watching the sun rise, at that moment you&#39;re a completely different individual.

It is quite full of ignorant prejudice of Zurbuchen to think that advanced civilizations would have settlements on multiple planets. It means that he&#39;s ignorant about the macro-ethical reasons for why that&#39;d be avoided by any civilization.

Great talk, Brian! I have a question - Hayabusa2 found 20,000 organic molecules which is basically a VERY TINY number. For reference Avogadro number is 6.023*10^23 so 2*10^4 is a very small number. How are we then so sure that it is from a primordial asteroid and not leakage from earth&#39;s atmosphere or some earth-origin dust particle. Even an entropic argument seems to be in favor of a leakage into the sample collector (there could be innumerable ways of leaking such a minuscule number of molecules). <br><br>How do we definitively know that the sample is 100.00% from that asteroid.
Great to see live WSF meeting.

The cost of rocket production has gone down 1/3 because it is now non-union, low benefit, private sector employment working for stock options rather than benefits. It has little to do with 24 hr shift work. Come on Mr. Zurbuchen. Not to turn the conversation into a labor dispute, but it may be greed or the motivation for wealth that drives down costs at the front end. There has been a cultural shift in that regard since the early space program. How do scientists negotiate that phenomenon?

No inhabitant of planet Earth has ever been in outer space. It seems that the Russians are showing the video with Gagarin as an ‚Äúexcursion‚Äù to Kazakhstan. One day you were visited by a ‚Äúguest from the future‚Äù to check who really lives on planet Earth. It took her two years to get here. She told how to remake the rocket for her in order to be able to return home. Unfortunately, she was handcuffed to the rocket to prevent her from getting back. Documentary footage can be seen in the clips that are now on YouTube ‚ÄúDream Theme‚Äù ‚Äî –¢–µ–º–∞ –º–µ—á—Ç—ã, (‚ÄúTravel with an Astronaut‚Äù) - –ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Å –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–æ–º, ‚ÄúBlue Planet‚Äù ‚Äì –ì–æ–ª—É–±–∞—è –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞. The rocket was boarded and thus she was able to return. The clips contain videos with footage of men who have nothing to do with astronautics. There is another video where you can see how she ‚Äúcame to visit,‚Äù where first one and then another parachute opens for insurance, having met a woman and a girl named Evgenia. The video ‚ÄúDream Theme‚Äù ‚Äî –¢–µ–º–∞ –ú–µ—á—Ç—ã ends, a video in which boys are running around some barrel and a bandy-legged man in an orange jumpsuit specially made for him for just walking. For your information, in Outer Space you need a spaceship and not only.... The melody for the Clips was written and played with the German orchestra from Cologne by Sofia-Galinka Romanyuk in 1970 in Moscow. The clips for the singing girl were created on Planet Uranus. She explained the laws of physics to Cosmos researchers, and many of them immediately became ‚Äúgreat scientists.‚Äù An anecdote from that time.<br>One party official of the USSR (you probably know at what time the country began to be called that) once said: ‚ÄúAmong the great Soviet (derived from the word advice) physicists, there are only Jews: Ioffe, Landau, Ginsburg, etc.... It‚Äôs good that there is at least one Russian ‚Äì Khalatnikov.‚Äù Yes, they answered him. Only Isaac Markovich remained. This means that the ‚Äúdiscoveries‚Äù of that time were taken from the Archives of the Civilization that existed here before.<br>–ù–∏ –æ–¥–∏–Ω –∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å –∏–∑ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã –ó–µ–º–ª—è –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª –≤ –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ. –ü–æ—Ö–æ–∂–µ, –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ —Å –ì–∞–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω—ã–º —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–µ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –∫–∞–∫ &quot;—ç–∫—Å–∫—É—Ä—Å–∏—é&quot; –≤ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∂–¥—ã –í–∞—Å –ø–æ—Å–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∞ &quot;–≥–æ—Å—Ç—å—è –∏–∑ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–≥–æ&quot;, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –∫—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–º–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–µ –∂–∏–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –ó–µ–º–ª—è. –ï–π –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –¥–≤–∞ –≥–æ–¥–∞, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –¥–æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —Å—é–¥–∞. –û–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–ª—è –Ω–µ–µ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç—É, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∏–º–µ—Ç—å –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –¥–æ–º–æ–π. –ö —Å–æ–∂–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é, –µ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–≤—è–∑–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä—É—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ –∫ —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–µ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–µ –¥–∞—Ç—å –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥. –î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∫–∞–¥—Ä—ã –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å –≤ –∫–ª–∏–ø–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤ YouTube ¬´–¢–µ–º–∞ –º–µ—á—Ç—ã¬ª(¬´–ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Å –ö–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–æ–º¬ª),¬´–ì–æ–ª—É–±–∞—è –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞¬ª. –†–∞–∫–µ—Ç—É –≤–∑—è–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –ê–±–æ—Ä–¥–∞–∂ –∏ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º –æ–Ω–∞ —Å–º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è. –í –∫–ª–∏–ø–∞—Ö –≤–º–æ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ —Å –∫–∞–¥—Ä–∞–º–∏ –º—É–∂—á–∏–Ω –Ω–µ –∏–º–µ—é—â–∏–º–∏ –Ω–∏–∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–∏–∫–µ. –ï—Å—Ç—å –µ—â–µ –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Ä–æ–ª–∏–∫, –≥–¥–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫ –æ–Ω–∞ ¬´–ø—Ä–∏—à–ª–∞ –≤ –≥–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª, –≥–¥–µ —Ä–∞—Å–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ –æ–¥–∏–Ω, –∞ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä–∞—à—é—Ç –¥–ª—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–æ–≤–∫–∏, –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–≤ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω—É –∏ –¥–µ–≤—É—à–∫—É –ø–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ó–∞–∫–∞–Ω—á–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–ª–∏–ø ¬´–¢–µ–º–∞ –º–µ—á—Ç—ã¬ª, –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏—à–∫–∏ –±–µ–≥–∞—é—Ç –≤–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ –∫–∞–∫–æ–π-—Ç–æ –±–æ—á–∫–∏ –∏ –∏–¥–µ—Ç –∫—Ä–∏–≤–æ–Ω–æ–≥–∏–π –º—É–∂–∏–∫ –≤ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø–æ—à–∏—Ç–æ–º –¥–ª—è –Ω–µ–≥–æ –æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∂–µ–≤–æ–º –∫–æ–º–±–∏–Ω–µ–∑–æ–Ω–µ. –ö —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—é, –≤ –ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ –≤–∞–º –Ω—É–∂–µ–Ω –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª—å –∏ –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ.... –ú–µ–ª–æ–¥–∏—é –¥–ª—è –ö–ª–∏–ø–æ–≤ –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∞ –∏ –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç —Å –Ω–µ–º–µ—Ü–∫–∏–º –æ—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–º –∏–∑ –ö—ë–ª—å–Ω–∞ –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è-–ì–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∫–∞ –†–æ–º–∞–Ω—é–∫ –≤ 1970 –≥–æ–¥—É –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ. –ö–ª–∏–ø—ã –¥–ª—è –ø–æ—é—â–µ–π –¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –£—Ä–∞–Ω. –û–Ω–∞ –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω—è–ª–∞ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º ¬´–ö–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–∞¬ª –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–∏ –∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ –∏–∑ –Ω–∏—Ö —Å—Ä–∞–∑—É —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏ ¬´–±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–º–∏ —É—á–µ–Ω—ã–º–∏¬ª. –ê–Ω–µ–∫–¥–æ—Ç —Ç–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏. –û–¥–∏–Ω –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–π–Ω—ã–π —á–∏–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –°–°–°–† (–Ω–∞–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç–µ —Å –∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞ —Ç–∞–∫ –Ω–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è) –∫–∞–∫-—Ç–æ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: ¬´–°—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö (–ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –æ—Ç —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç) —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–æ–≤ –æ–¥–Ω–∏ –µ–≤—Ä–µ–∏: –ò–æ—Ñ—Ñ–µ, –õ–∞–Ω–¥–∞—É, –ì–∏–Ω—Å–±—É—Ä–≥ –∏ –¥—Ä‚Ä¶. –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ, —á—Ç–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Ö–æ—Ç—å –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π ‚Äî –•–∞–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤¬ª. –î–∞, –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∏ –µ–º—É. –¢–æ–ª—å–∫–æ, –ò—Å–∞–∞–∫ –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∏—á –∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—Å—è. –≠—Ç–æ –∫ —Ç–æ–º—É, —á—Ç–æ ¬´–æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—è¬ª —Ç–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –≤–∑—è—Ç—ã –∏–∑ –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–æ–≤ –¶–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è —Ç—É—Ç —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ —Ä–∞–Ω—å—à–µ.

Space exploration? More like UNIVERSE DOMINATION and that&#39;s a FACT!
In this era of robotic and ai systems filling less desirable jobs, we need to explore just for job creation. <br><br>Another benefit, Steven Hawking says some disaster will make humans on earth extinct, other estimates less then 1 million, or as soon as 500 million years. <br><br>With the technology we learn from habitating Mars, will be needed here in earth with in this 1000 year to 500 million years and before earth becomes hazardous to life. <br><br>Being prepared to create sustainable life should be the first concern, and we learn that by taking Mars.
If it wasn‚Äôt for science‚Ä¶ we would not have the things we have today.

That life will be found on other planets, or moons in our galaxy is a given. The bigger question will be the origin of it. The Chicxulub asteroid killed off the dinosaurs when it hit the Yucat√°n Peninsula 66 million years ago. 25 trillion tons of material (50,000 cubic miles) were ejected from the crater, some of it left the earth&#39;s orbit. Some organisms can survive in space. Over 250 different species of bacteria and fungi can survive, and thrive in outer space The ejected material would have spread through our galaxy like a cloud, and it could have ended up on all the celestial bodies where it could have reproduced. So......yes life forms will be found in our galaxy, but the odds are that it was probably transported from earth 66million years ago.
What about hydrogen from the sun mixing with oxygen in our atmosphere to create our water, star water.

What a dumb debate.
Don&#39;t focus on distant fantasies. Planet earth and masses of suffering human beings are in desperate need of attention and improvements. Outerspace for the satellites necessary for international communications and weather observations is one thing. Beyond that it&#39;s a total scam, a waste, a selfish, criminal action by a clever, shrewd bunch of devils who are exploiting the masses to fund their hobby. üòâ
The golden age of space exploration has yet to begin. India, China, the ESA are making big steps. More startups are joining the race, more countries like Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia are enhancing their space tech. <br>Shit is going to be good

I would hope in 100 years we will be interstellar. There need to be some modification to general  relativity to make this happen.
Don&#39;t hold your breath on breaking general relativity.
What needs be found is not a problem with relativity, that&#39;s pretty solid.  It will take insight, and technological developments we can&#39;t really imagine at this time.  But, on the scale of that technological development, a century is quite a big chunk of time.  What&#39;s the answer?  Who knows.  I left my crystal ball behind on the first  trans-pacific passenger flight, only 33 years after the Wright Brothers&#39; first brief, powered, sustained, and controlled airplane flight (1903).<br>But, manned interstellar in a single human lifetime beginning less than a century from now is probably a stretch.  Sadly, nobody in this conversation will live long enough to see the departure even in the best-case scenario.

What a BORING discourse! Nothing new, no revelations.......NASA guy is quite amusing......Prof Greene must&#39;ve thought the same as myself and many others. Dull, dull, dull.....

lunatics still talking about black holes, dark energy and matter, big bang, expanding universe or age of universe...people long time know that these are silly fantasies
None is out there looking for us.<br>They are looking at us, a fallen world.
Let&#39;s face it. All this interest &amp; hype about the moon etc right now owe it to China. Just like how in the past the Soviet Union launched the US into a space race in the 60s. And to talk of a golden age of space exploration in the next few decades without also talking about what China &amp; Russia is doing is I think a ridiculously stunning, foolish, unscientific omission, on a bigger scale than the foolishness of banning China from the ISS.

Enough of the vaccine propaganda. So thankful I didn‚Äôt take that poison.
On the subject of ChatGPT... please do an updated episode on AI soon! I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you could get Sam Altman on if you approached him through the right channels. He, somebody like Matt Wolfe (who is very up-to-date on AI developments), and two AI researchers/developers/ethicists who can discuss and ask questions about technical details would be a really interesting synergy.
Do you think that the opening joke, particularly the answer: &quot;You asked me to deliver the joke in the voice of Brian Green&quot; is true?
Very cool stuff.
Perhaps a better joke would have been: &quot;Why did the astronaut cross the black hole?&quot;  The same punchline, &quot;to get to the other side of the universe.&quot;  OK, so I&#39;m not a professional comedy writer.
An intelligence superseding us by a billion years. Sheesh. We could be staring &quot;them&quot; right in the face and not even recognize it as life. They would be unimaginably different.
I don&#39;t think so. The elements that make us would be the same elements that make them. I imagine all life in the universe is much more similar to earth organisms than we think.
The probabilistic argument about so many galaxies with so many stars is very one sided. Approach it from the other end. Take all the billions of steps that had to go &#39;right&#39; to get something like us here and consider the probability of those step happening and happening in a sufficiently short time frame so all those billions of step could happen within the lifetime of the universe. If in those billions of steps you can find a few dozen that had only a 50% chance of happening there is statistically less than 1 civilization in the visible universe. It is easy to believe that given the numbers of stars it&#39;s a statistical certainty we&#39;re not alone, but if you dive into the statistics of what had to happen to get us here it&#39;s equally easy to conclude that the odds are so stacked against it that it&#39;s a statistical certainty we are alone. Without a decent understanding of what it takes to get life started, what is needed to get to technology and all the ways that life can be wiped out or set back it&#39;s essentially impossible to say whether we&#39;re alone unless we find another civilization. Based on what know now, we can conclude the universe is teeming with life, we&#39;re alone or anything in between with equally reasonable assumptions. <br><br>That all said, if you&#39;ve to make a bet, bet on technological life is out there. Though based on what we know scientifically dubious, it&#39;s a position that is &#39;easy&#39; to be proven correct and virtually impossible to be proven wrong while the position of we&#39;re alone is virtually impossible to be proven right and &#39;easy&#39; to be proven wrong.
really? did they go to the moon? I do not thing so !!!
Are you a smart person? I do not &quot;thing&quot; so !!!
We went to the moon, you absolute brainlet.
This program is airing simultaneously with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Once we worked with Russia.  I am thinking about the recurring theme of Star Trek.  World War III.

Aude &amp; Thomas both dodged Brian&#39;s question about risking human lives.  That&#39;s a crucial difference in approach.  SpaceX built Dragon to meet NASA&#39;s safety requirements,  but future companies could fly any janky missions so long as the crew sign their disclaimers.  It&#39;ll speed up expansion in capabilities enormously.
I dunno...  The Titan didn&#39;t do much to advance deep sea exploration...
Yes, much of what I was taught years ago is outdated.  That‚Äôs OK and I am aware that it is outdated because of cutting edge science that is becoming known to me through this program!  What an exciting time to be alive!
interesting conversation, good question of topic to be honest eventhough some were not answered. its is hard.
Thank you very much for this very interesting event.<br>There is hope for the earth and the humans if we can work together across the borders.<br>If the population are contiuing to increase on earth we will need to colonice Mars and other planets.<br>Let Science bring peace amoung people all over the world and i am sure that in a hundred year the world will be a better place for all of us.<br>There is no limit out there so let go for it....üëç‚ù§Ô∏è

The most difficult part of searching for Extraterrestrial  signals/Extraterrestrial Life is as in the Drake equation,<br><br>N = <br>R* x Fp x Nc x. Fl x Fi x Fc x L<br><br>Where N is the # of intelligent civilizations capable of communication with us ...<br><br> R* is the rate of star formation with in the Milkyway Galaxy ...<br><br>Fp is the # fraction of stars that have planets in the habitable zone<br><br>Nc is the # of planets that could support life per star with planets<br><br>FL is the fraction of life-supporting planets that develop life<br><br>Fi the fraction of those planets that support life develop intelligence<br><br>Fc is the fraction of intelligent civilizations that develop communication tech<br><br>L = The TIME that those communication capable intelligent civilizations exist <br><br>I think eventually each of the variables will eventually have a relative number assigned. As future discovery and exploration answers these questions <br><br>If you start out with 300 billion stars and we now know that on average,<br><br> every star has planets the average number of planets orbiting in the habitable zone per star =1<br><br>This gives us 300 billion planets that are in the habitable zone of there relative star. <br><br>If 1% of those 300 billion planets develop life ... this gives us 3 billion planets supporting life <br><br>If 1% of those 3 billion planets that support life develop intelligent civilizations, <br><br>this  gives us 30,000,000 intelligent civilizations in our galaxy alone <br><br>If 1% of those 30 million intelligent civilizations are capable of communicating with us, there would be 300,000 Extraterrestrial civilizations capable of communicating with us in our own galaxy    BUT    the last part of the equation has a degree of difficulty that is literally astronomical  ... The longevity factor ... how long an intelligent communicating civilization can exist. <br><br>Since humanity has only existed as a civilization for approximately 75,000 years and the Milkyway is approximately 13.2 billion years old<br><br>Space-Time could be the dimension that prevents us from being aware of a universe so   complex ....It would be like if our universe were only 2 dimensions ... existing in a 2 dimensional  universe, we would only know about width and length ... <br><br>Discovering Extraterrestrial Life, even if just fossilized microbes, would be the most profound discovery in human history
I think the Fermi Paradox is probable. We will probably destroy ourselves with advanced technology weapons . The warning signs are already visible .Do you think the likes of Russia, with such weapons ,won&#39;t end in disaster .It won&#39;t matter who else exists in the Universe .When we are capable enough , we are destructive enough.
Physics is badazz.
Excellent show. Brian is a great interviewer. I was unaware of the details of these coming missions. So exciting.
How&#39;d they get out of the prime directive question?

I&#39;m hoping that in 100 years we have moved on into and past our solar system, and have at least sent a probe to a neighboring system, maybe Alpha Centauri ?
In a hundred years I hope we are building interstellar spaceships

we would likely have to build a large amount of infrastructure first in the Sol system before considered leaving into interstellar space.

To my mind, I would say that having a remote simulated gravity space station orbiting around the sun in the asteroid belt, would be the most economical solution to long term space habitability. Since many of the required resources are already there for the taking (metals, water, fuels, etc.) and they aren&#39;t trapped by planetary gravity which makes them relatively easy to mine and transport.
Smash The rocks together. Asteroid belt. We can build a new planet with gravity and all. engineer a a nice sustainable nuclear reaction in the middle. put in pipe works as we smash the rocks together. This is the Intelligent choice.
Are these only live in Australia? I would love to listen to something like this in person but I&#39;m in Texas. Either way, thank you wsf and Dr Greene!!
I think they&#39;re normally in New York (but I could be mistaken).  I was surprised when they mentioned this one is in Australia.
Thank you sir

Love Brian also. We have no evidence yet for life out there but just the fact many government agency have pretty much accepted the possibility of life out there. Just that acceptance, without evidence speaks volumes. Govt saying ‚Äúyes, there probably out there‚Äù so what.
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for having me. You know, recently NASA was considering sending me to space to study string theory. But they quickly changed their minds when they realized, in zero gravity, it&#39;s impossible to keep the strings from tangling!&quot;<br>Yep, not very good yet.
I dont understand why we&#39;re needing this new tecnologies, big preparation and training to send men on the moon! We&#39;ve already done in 1969! Am I right?
Yeah, but wasn&#39;t very safe, killed three people on the ground, and almost killed another three in space(from 24 that were launched in whole program ) , and only 12 humans walked on the moon, and for very short periods of time (like some only few hours and others only a little more than two days ), we will need to make those things safer and continuous , and with all tehnologycal progress of the last 50 years we actually are knowing very little about the moon(the closest celestial bodies, witch should be the most knowed ) , so are good reasons to send humans again on the moon surface, and even beyond.
Turned off the video at exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm8OHGvl4Oc&amp;t=324">5:24</a>, after the speaker brought op covid-, only to spread lies about it and push the lying mainstream narrative/agenda. How much did you get paid to push their agenda?<br>&quot;Vaccines being tested&quot;, they obviously weren&#39;t tested in that extremely short period. The many casuals and people who are still suffering from them, are proof of that.<br>It has NOT &quot;helped&quot; us get back to a more normal life. The covid period was there for the biggest wealth transfer in our history, from the normies and poor to the richest 1% &#39;elites&#39;. It was there to enforce and test more control over us by the government. The elite like Bill Gates, big tech and governments were never this aligned at forcing more control over us to push their evil agenda&#39;s.<br>Won&#39;t listen to-, or watch a thing from this POS. Hard down vote.
Excellent scientists keep the good jobs..
100 yes from now I hope we will manipulate the seven galaxy or universe and use them efficiently sufficiently and sustainable..

How could you have this conversation and not mention spaceX. They are literally paving the way in this area and changed the way we do everything space. I donno man im a huge fan of wsf but this is inscrutable.
they did mention it

Demons aren&#39;t real, numb nuts.
Humans in space to learn sustainability?   Pure BS.   It&#39;s easier to learn how to do that without adding the difficulty of space into the equation.  And we haven&#39;t bothered to learn it on earth so why will adding the huge difficulty and expense of space change things?   All nonsense.   And we&#39;ll send humans for &quot;inspiration&quot;?  Sheesh.  Grow up, people?
It&#39;s a good thing people like you are few to non existent in the scientific community. If humanity as a whole agreed with your abysmal outlook, we would&#39;ve never reached the level of technology and knowledge we have today.<br><br>Here&#39;s a tip: Speak less, and listen more. You might learn something.
I disagree.  Everything up through Apollo and Shuttle was just our down payment. I believe we are now entering &quot;the golden age of space exploration. &quot;  If you agree, please give it a thumbs up üëç
Correction.  I shall call Apollo,  The Shuttle,  and ISS as a proof of concept.  What happens next will become the Golden Age.  <br><br>But what will happen after that?  The real road block is what happens when we&#39;re ready to move out of our solar system?
Nobody mentioned that the supposed chances of life elsewhere are entirely dependent on the assumptions behind genesis of life on earth - a complete unknown.  The chances were considered high (because of so many planets) and yet when considering the level of  development of any alien civilization the chances were considered to be &quot;nil&quot; that they would be at our own developmental level.  Nobody minds making assertions that life is &quot;certain&quot; elsewhere yet the chances of it being at same level are &quot;nil&quot;?  This is really bad reasoning!  <br><br>Nobody knows what the likelihood of life is.  So far all the evidence is life has only happened once - here on earth.  This is too uncomfortable for folks to grok?

No one likes to discuss Venus.
People speaking about space exploration when we haven&#39;t even explored our own planet is perplexing.  We&#39;ve dug a mere 7.5 miles into the Earth.  We don&#39;t know much about our own planet yet carry such hubris about our understanding &amp; abilities to explore other planets.

I remember when Hubble launched, I was almost 14 years old. They were going to build the Terrestrial Planet Finder telescope, but it was canceled in 2011. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it happens again.

Brian is so good to make complicated terms easy to understand by a layman. And his presence on stage is so laid-back. He&#39;s a gem in the Physics world
In an ideal world, every country would be forced to spend certain percentage of its military budget (say 10%) on scientific space program.I mean, they are hell bent to destroy the planet, then they should also invest in seeking for plan-B worlds.<br>That means, the increased $$$ in these programs would attract more talented guys. The way I see it now, these people in this sector are not the most intelligent or innovative bunch humanity can offer.

The most important fundamental you need to recognize is the very first verse of the Bible  IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. Genesis 1:1. Why because you are dealing with a mathematical problem that is backed by intelligence. Until then you can understand nothing about the Truth of Creation .

5,312 confirmed planets outside of our solar system...pretty cool data!!
Very interesting, but how many times did the folks say, &quot;actually&quot;? I gave up counting.
I tend to disagree with the 20 to 30 year time span of insights gleaned from the JWST, especially with the advent of AI.  The speed of data analysis and insights from it is set to change exponentially.
I would like to witness each of these scientists, human beings, looking directly into the camera and asking the political, corporate and religious leaders, from all over planet earth, one question. &quot;When collaborating scientist, from all over planet earth, discover life elsewhere, out in the cosmos, will you &quot;leaders&quot; attempt to destroy that life as you attempt to destroy life on planet earth every day? üò¢

Part 3: I personally think that applying the required habitability conditions for ourselves to other planets is a huge disservice to science especially based on temperature. It basically assumes other living organisms would need the same conditions we do. When it&#39;s argued that we evolved om this planet. While other organisms could evolve uniquely on their planet. We still don&#39;t know without a doubt that there&#39;s no living organisms on the planets within our own solar system.
Part 1: &quot;Dark matter&quot; is completely speculation and theory. Despite millions if not billions of dollars no models or the particle Collider has proven. It&#39;s amusing to see them play with the term &quot;dark energy&quot;, while trying to avoid the word &quot;electricity&quot;. They are trying their hardest to not acknowledge that there&#39;s more proof of an &quot;Electric Universe&quot;. Which some test have shown similar if not the same type of spiral formations of galaxies. Which is far closer to providing an explanation of the formation of galaxies than the made up &quot;dark matter&quot; theories.

My goodness, Australian scientists sound as if they have marbles in their mouths.  The first guy Carl is clearly intelligent but was barely comprehensible.  And if the lady in part two , Michelle, is a lead science communicator, then it really speaks to how far behind in science communication Aussies have to go, particularly when you compare them to how easy to understand their American counterparts are.  It&#39;s not just a question of accent, but of clarity of expression.  Weird.
No scientific background of my own. Yet having watched all the WSF features, all of the ‚ÄúHistory of the Universe‚Äù and ‚ÄúKosmos‚Äù channel videos I truly applaud the effort and work of these brilliant minds to bring about and share their discoveries with all of Mankind.

hey, I&#39;m just a plumber it&#39;s plumbing some shit. What is the fact that aliens are seeing with big eyes indicates that they may have pain from two off red stars. Big eyes means low light long wavelength.
Eyes are for studying the composition of milky way galaxy. Good experience from this conversation.
Junk science.
fantastic, fantasic discoveries, fantastic, but we are not going to tell you what is fantastic. that is so fantastic!
OMG, all they show are simulations, cartoons. DID WEBB BLOW UP?<br>ANSWER ME THIS<br>Since galaxies travel in space time as they cross the universe, emitting light along the way, then we should be able to observe the same galaxy at different places in the sky, different places in the life of the galaxy and universe, by figuring out the direction of the galaxy and its speed, then mapping the universe forward and backward in spacetime and making observations there. IN OTHER WORDS,, as an example, If Galaxy A is observed to be 1 billion light years away when the telescope aims at in say in Andromeda, and we could extrapolate or guess which way it came and/or which way it is going then we could find it elsewhere in the sky, say at 2 billion years ago, and half a billion years ago. WHERE IS THIS WRONG?
This is an interesting question. I believe in order to observe an object at two difference places in spacetime simultaneously from our perspective, that object would need to be moving faster than the speed of light (which, according to our current understanding, is not possible).<br>Imagine holding a laser pointer and pointing its laser at a wall. You can move your arm up and down as fast as you want, but at any given moment, the laser will only be hitting the wall at a single point. If your arm could teleport upward instantaneously (ignoring the speed of light), only then would the laser hit the wall at two places at once. Earth is the wall, observing incoming light;<br>The laser pointer is the galaxy we wish to observe;<br>The laser itself is the light emitting from that galaxy, traveling towards Earth.<br>The laser pointer has to move faster than its laser in order for lasers to hit the wall at two points simultaneously. Similarly, the galaxy would have to move faster than its emitted light to be seen by the Earth in two points simultaneously.
Your answer starts off funny. &quot;... to observe an object at two different places in spacetime simultaneously from our perspective&quot; The observer is also our perspective, right? The observer is at on point in spacetime, let&#39;s call it the present. The thing we are observing is not visible because it&#39;s light of the present is leaving it and will take light eons to reach us where we were at what we called the present, now far away and in the past. Light is fast, but not instantaneous. Space is big, real big. We see the light of the object from the past as it reaches us from a time and place long ago and far away (don&#39;t even think about light traveling in a straight line, it does, but it&#39;s not necessary for our problem). That light has reached our present. We look in a different part of the sky. We see an object whose light has reached us in the present, that light traveled from somewhere far away and in a different place. If we could map a trajectory between those two lights, at appropriate speed and direction, we could show those are the same object, changed and shaped by space and time. QED LOL   Let me add this. SUPPOSE the light is from a galaxy and that galaxy is orbiting in a cluster. We might be able to analyze the cluster in multiple projections. It might even end up on one exposure from Webb 13 billion light years, more and less, a few rotations...
Well u zoom telescope at point B in space and then wait billion plus few years to see the light from this galaxy when it gets to point B?
They are just all so positive and pleasant to listen to .. ..AND...may I add (?) They are just so talented....Here you can clearly see that it really is the &quot;desire&quot; that makes the work! What a great enthusiasm they show! They love their job...nice to watch...Bravo !<br><br>Imagine if ALL workplaces had such a cool atmosphere?? Ohhh? haha! .üòÅ
More raw data next to composite images is required to afford the credibility to such necessary explorations.

Hi John
But i am tired,
Well I tell u my friend how is it
Yes my friend  sir green, if I can‚Äôt figure it in his actions,  im going to  his words
Hey guys. I have an idea. What about we consider that the backhoes in the centre of each galaxy could be the place that some kind of existence enters our universe and it converts to matter and energy in our universe. Like when water makes a vortex  as it sinks in a hole, the other side of the hole it forms an expanding vortex. For an observer who looks at this vortex from the other side it look like all the water is turning around a space that there&#39;s no water in it at all. Maybe we are on the other side of a vortex that connects our universe to the other universe. Ofcourse we need to create a mathematical model for this idea
Surely it&#39;s now logical reasoning that indeed the Timeline for the Big Bang has to be wrong or even if there was an event that was not the first Big Bang. It&#39;s all because this incredible piece of Human scientific engineering tech James Webb has now been discovered with redshift tech, proving that it is not 13.8  billion years. IF as reported observed Stars and Galaxys further away in time anything viewed beyond the 13.8 Billion cut-offs must make that number redundant. I have never understood the evidence or reasons that there was indeed nothing before this massive event, I have always leaned on the theory of a coming together of two supermassive Black Holes a massive singularity event that was a dominant presence in a much smaller uncluttered farther spread out universe. It&#39;s a human trait that you must have a start and end all things are not finite, and space is not defined like that nothing scientifically allows something to come from that nothing it does not, relatively speaking for every action there is a reaction cause, and effect. Now with quantum mechanics what relativity thought to be nothing was actually something. Now incorporating a quantum field a vacuum is no longer vacuous or empty with many subatomic particles in residence. to me traveling back to any Galaxy that is as old as 12 plus billion years mean that these galaxies all took million of years to be able to form and there way before the theoretical age of the Universe.

i really dont get all those Trump bashing tbh, it&#39;s ridiculous, on other part of the world we get it, you dont like him, he looks stupid, said things that are stupid, but unlike his opponents he doesn&#39;t have blood on his hand and speak what he think is the truth, he may be corrupted in the business, but certainly not to the extent others are, Obama, Biden, Bush, Clinton, those have bloods on their hands everybody knows this.<br>So actually, i&#39;m really wondering why is it that Trump is always treated like this.<br>You guys should make yourselves a favor, and just stop with that.
Legit question to all scientists. When are we going to get the star trek &quot;telescope&quot; what I mean is how they can zoom in like a camera across light-years of distance and read the name on the other guys ship. Why can we not zoom in with our space observatories
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. One paper using discredited old hypothesis did not overturn current lamda CDM model of our universe.
THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE GOING UP IN SMOKE !!!<br>So Good bye &quot;Big Bang, and &quot;Expanding Universe&quot;. Which certain branches of Science have always pointed out, are PURELY HYPOTHETICAL ! <br>MATHEMATICS you need to understand is NOT part of Science, despite Albert Einsteins best attempts to convince people otherwise !!!<br>THE ABUSE OF THE DOPPLER EFFECT referred to as Blue or Red shift, is claimed to prove Galaxies are moving towards or away from each other. But as MANY real Research Scientists have repeatedly PROVEN. IT IS NOT the Doppler effect that accounts for nearly all Galaxies being slightly red or occasionally blue ! Galaxies with a red tint (around 90%) is because 75% of all stars in the Universe are small red dwarfs. Virtually invisible singularly but on mass account for the red tint. Blue being rare accounts for the occasional Galaxy that has a high quantity of very large Blue White Stars, such as our neighbouring Galaxy Andromeda. Which is NOT going to crash into our Galaxy at all, as its blue tint has nothing to do with movement, and everything to do with its high percentage of very large blue white stars.  <br>Sadly this &quot;LECTURE&quot; is 90% THEORETICAL GARBAGE - SO NOT FACTUAL PROVEN SCIENCE.
PHILOSOPHY - TODAY THEY CALL IT THEORETICAL SCIENCE - ARE WE BEING CONNED ? <br>THEORY as your dictionary will tell you means: Quote &quot;A collection of IDEAS&quot; Unquote.<br>So EVERYTHING a Theoretical Scientist (PHILOSOPHER) says, does NOT NEED to be proven ! Indeed there is so much money is this deceptive field today, that it now accounts for 50% of the people making up the &quot;American Scientific Community&quot;. And yet they deal in Philosophy, which they now want to call THEORETICAL SCIENCE. This is a BRAZEN CON, AND NOT FACTUAL RESEARCH SCIENCE AT ALL !!!<br><br>Before ANY THEORY can be raised to the level of SCIENTIFIC LAW, research has to be completed, producing the EVIDENCE to support the THEORY, before the relevant INSTITUTE for that branch of Science, sits to consider the evidence, upon which they can either refuse or raise the Theory to SCIENTIFIC LAW.<br><br> But of course these &quot;Theoretical Scientists&quot; have already got their money giving talks like the one above, where tickets are now in excess of $250+ each. So Research, Proof, not on your life, this monkey Brian Greene is just another clever CON Artist !
LOGICAL...Universe since then is ALREADY INFINITE,I don&#39;t know why This some Scientists they BELIEVE in the Wrong Thing.. How can you BELIEVE in big Bang..it came from NOTHING...that is Stupidity..I give an Example..do you think you can control your Satellite or what ever machine you invented without Human Control or Created to move that machine... that&#39;s a BIG BIG IMPOSSIBLE.I don&#39;t know why humans are Scientists Brain is only an ATOM compared to the brain of the CREATOR.üòÖ

Brian Greene skipped over her opportunity to close out with her concept or exoplanets
Maybe soon we will see JWST data help refine and revise our various standard candles.
Alway brilliant üëç
I mean seriously, our observational capabilities have gone through a couple magnitudes in the last 100 years. It&#39;s as bananas as going from Wright brothers to Apollo landings in 70 years.
... many ? ... few ! ... JWST appears to have humbled us, to the point of realizing the extent of the speculative nature of our physical sciences ... a giant step forward ... also interesting the high degree of speculation, qualification and apparent evasion of revealing possible factual information here ... seems that it is very difficult to reveal that the answers simply are not measurably known ... the third segment guests are refreshingly candid about this ... bravo ...onward ...
Thanks for the the interview.
I just heard that the universe is now older than about 24 billion LY.
When I first started watching Brian Greene on the stream presenting talks on quantum mechanics, physics experiments, he was just about the age of these young scientists. It&#39;s a testament to Greene how many audiences he has reached bringing the message of the cosmos to the world.
I enjoyed watching all the various Cosmology in Crisis presentations on different channels.

This should be hyped as the scientific comic con. Or the NBA finals or super bowl. Get Neil deGrasse Tyson to host it. Children could actually get hyped about science. (Public)Schools shows you one tray at a time and hopes you see the forest at the end
Thanks to all of for taking time &amp; sharing the exciting findings!
Brian Greene my good sir, please tell us about the non-human intelligences lol
Jon Evans put it together. The Universe is not expanding. It is easily looked at as a giant ball of energy (the Higgs Field) as energy spins and becomes quarks atoms matter galaxies and so forth. It moves through space along filaments INWARD. The CMB moves in our location at 67.5 m/s The Galaxies at 74m/s (byebye expansion of space and anyone who tries to use it any longer. you shall be tar&#39;d and feathered) As these galaxies move inward they form clusters and move toward the center of Gravity. The Great Attractor in our case and then the SHapely Super Cluster. DARK FLOW is the (only dark word that has any truth to it) flow of everything moving toward that location. Eventually things will turn into black holes and hawking radiation and one giant party at the end of &quot;time&quot; (thats for another episode) Time is Energy. Time/Energy=Mc2. All Matter is spinning energy. Spinning Energy combines to slow down time. Lots of Spinning Energy = Gravity Wells aka black holes and such. Light Has Energy. Light gets Bent by Higher densities of Energy. You all just solved everything by reading this. The Universe is infinite. Time is relative to the observer. The observer being the Higgs field aka the Universe is it starts on the outskirts and moves toward the center of gravity for the easiest image to make in your mind.
Wonderful knowledge üëç
We are looking at millions and millions of years back in time. What we are looking at do not exist anymore. <br>Galaxies are even a life on other planets are endless.
Shameful ‚Ä¶. Brilliant but has to go and insult half of America that actually appreciated what Trump did for the economy‚Ä¶.  Biden has been a fumbling joke‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt have to be a scientist to see that. Anyone liking their out of this world grocery bills lately???
New view, new theories.
How it started is out of our reach, what&#39;s even further away is the why. Most humans think it blew from a tiny point it&#39;s how big that point was we don&#39;t know yet. My hat of to all scientists, because what they have achieved since their coming into being in their field&#39;s. Jaw dropping. ü§ìüññ‚úåÔ∏è
Awesome. This kind of stuff makes me proud to be a human.
Fascinating!
Trust your kings.<br>We are doing our best to get it working.<br>I am not going to back down.<br>Be a rainbow today.<br>Let us move together.
From a layman‚Äôs perspective I see three possibilities so far:<br><br>1. The Universe is far older and the calculations from what has been largely thought of as reliable data is simply incorrect.<br><br>2. Galaxies formed much faster in the early Universe (with very different characteristics) due to concentrations of dark energy.<br><br>3. This one is reaching out there - The gravitational lensing is far more powerful than calculated and we are actually seeing galaxies from an earlier or even a neighboring Universe? If so, wouldn‚Äôt it render our distance data irrelevant‚Ä¶or is that just nuts? Please someone let me know if it is.

I loved it all right up until you decided that advanced alien civilizations would question human reasoning based on Trump&#39;s election... you don&#39;t think that the past 100+ years with Hitler, Stalin, the holocaust, Vietnam, Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Rwanda, Bosnia, weaponized viruses, human trafficking, global warming, etc etc would be what would disappoint or disgust an intelligent civilization? Really? Trump? üò¢
The fact you brought politics into this by disparaging Donald Trump is really disappointing  it shows that even at your level of intellect  you are still capable of falling foul of indoctrination and irrational hate makes me think maybe we aren&#39;t ready to interact with other intelligent life
They know absolutely nothing about whats happening out there, pretending that whatever they make up is whats actually happening, WTF do they know about what happened back then??!! They ask such stupid questions!
On a read between the lines level Brian Greene is an absolute savage on many occasions
These images are disproving all their theories.  Totally destroying their false narrative.  So they have to come up with another theory to propagate their Big Bust.
Does anyone else find it interesting that the two snapshots of the pillars of creation (shown during the opening) show so little change in the gas cloud&#39;s size and shape? Really brings home how large and far away these things must be. Does anyone know offhand how many years between the two snapshots?

@@DaytonWhite96 everyone has an opinion. Glad I&#39;m not getting canceled for expressing mine.
It seems we have a long way to go.  Our understanding of the universe is changing as data comes from James Webb.<br>Thank you very much for this wonderful program Prof. Brian Greene
Can we gat a IMAX movie of the discoveries.  I&#39;d love that and I&#39;m sure many others would.
I love Brian Greene...ty for all you do....
If by big bang everything started at once, so how can we see the past events like formation of stars, why every particle in universe is not on same time frame as it started in same moment of big bang.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=800">13:20</a> - Am I watching a Monty Python skit? Do these people really get paid for this? There are millions of people doing important jobs that directly affect our lives every day that don&#39;t make a fraction of the money that these unproductive scientists do! I find that a reordering of the universe is in order!
Just like the &quot;scientists&quot; of the past thought that the Earth was the center of the Universe, we now believe that just on the edge of our observable universe are the very first galaxies and stars! Such hubris and obnoxious selfishness. Unbecomming of science and true knowledge!
So predictable! Yes. I have been saying this forever! Theoretical Physics is extremely tenuous physics.
I look forward to this Festival every year.
Pure gold!
If it takes billions of years for the light/image of far away objects in the universe to reach earth then how do we know of any of that stuff is even still there? We could just be looking back in history instead of what is presently there today. I just wonder if we had the ability to travel faster than the speed of light when it would be that the images we see through our telescopes would fade away and we would see the reality of what actually exists there today.
We don&#39;t know.  Its all a snap shot in time.
If our galaxy was the size of the USA then our sun would be the size of a red blood cell.
I am made uneasy by watching this discussion. There appears an increasing distance between the lofty ideals of these minds and the leaden opportunists who lead us. Just saying.
Huge money, the truth is no benefit more science fiction.
I wanted to say thank you for your presentation. You do a great job of making these topics accessible, and approachable to non-scientest. On multiple occasions I&#39;ve hurd you be self deprecating. Also on multiple occasions I&#39;ve hurd you express a sincere invitation for anyone to consider the data. You do a great job of interpolating the shop talk of academics and literally bringing it down to earth. I really think that you are opening doors to future generations of scientists by making it more accessible. Thank you, to you and everyone behind the scenes who helps you.
How is any of this supposed to help mankind?
How are you helping mankind?
What a treat!
I feel maybe our model of the universe is wrong and the big bang was a white hole, there was galaxies already forming when the repulsive force of the white hole has only just stopped 13 billion years ago and the universe is probably trillions of years old üòÇ
Awesome, just one critism. The white backgrounds on the streams are way to bright, especially on a big screen tv. Hurts my eyes to be honest and is not nice to watch
Stop sucking up on Brian .. he‚Äôs doing a great job without it
Correction; Science
Some 30 years ago when I was reading science, I read an article on the early universe, detailing how there were two models, at that time, I really Galaxy formation. One was the bottom up. Model were the first object to form with it we‚Äôre stars, and they would aggregate into clusters in the clusters would grow in the galaxies. The other, competing, model was the top down model, which Argued that early galaxies formed as one object initially, rapidly accumulating mass from the surrounding, and burns to form a galaxy sized mass, which then differentiated into stars. Considering the fact that at the time of the early universe, the universe itself was much smaller and extent, and therefore much denser, it seems logical that galaxy and star formation would proceed rapidly. The recent web findings showing massive galaxies formed early on, seems to support the top down model. What is the current consensus in this regard?
That feeling when the smartest guys on this planet tell you stories.... I love this channel.
Never ceases to amaze. Extraordinary!

It was my pleasure to be on this show with Brian Greene
Why can&#39;t you just say how good the image is? it&#39;s not been posted online yet, the majority of the earths population isn&#39;t paying attention to this type of news. They are concerned with the kardashisms or whatever they&#39;re called.
Hmm beyond Neptune?   I know it is hard to believe and you can call me crazy.   But that‚Äôs where we are going to find exotic life forms, mostly in asteroid belt , some day.  Mark my word.

JWST deep field is gonna be a BIG deal
Thanks to Brian Greene for asking critical and good questions.. This is just beautiful. BEYOND beautiful!!!.
I‚Äôm thinking that the early universe was in a much smaller space, so it makes sense to me (an absolute novice) that stars and galaxies would form and evolve much quicker.
Thanks to Brian Greene for asking critical and good questions.
Habitable zone???...it might be a joke these days Europa is not in the habitable zone as well as enceladus...and it&#39;s possible that live exist under the ice crust...
why in an expanding universe would it be unusual that the early universe be expanding slower than the later part?
They don&#39;t know... But additional funding, time and tools might uncover some new information.<br><br>Meanwhile creating a material to fill potholes that will last more than 3 months still eludes us.

What if in the same way a planetary system forms from the remains of a star, galaxies formed from the remains of super giant early stars which created the super massive black holes in the centre of galaxies? Then again for all we know we&#39;re in a black hole right now...
They are simply tryong to justify the billions they stole from you. This like the super collider results are made up bs.

&quot;its like building cathedrals&quot; i truly appreciate all involved...keep pushing us forward
Thanks Brain for such discussions. I like this discussion which I am still watching at around 33 minutes. I also had the change to watch the talk about  James WEBB few days before it was launched.<br>@just have minor question on the ring images. Do they always appear in that (not sure how to say in English ... let me us horizontal shape) horizontal like shape or is there a vertical like shape straight to our view dimensions or angle which are crossing those laying ring-shape. E.g. close shape like the way we draw our longitude and latitude lines our the equator which are imaginary while these are real objects&#39; shape appearing in such circles. I mean are they one side circles or 2 intersecting like circles?<br><br>The reason I am asking for such data is that I am thinking in space as without-directions or dimensions as a whole-as-space.
I am glad they finally got it off the ground. I&#39;d been waiting 20 years. I only wish I had another 20 in me for it.
So nobody is going to talk about his voice, okay
The assumptions of the origins of the universe are wrong but intellectual mathematical physics are developed from the observing human collective brain that has followed a path of scientific egos whose egos compartmentalize the enormous existence of our infinite reality into their devoted field of supposed objective meaning into a finite certainty contained within their mortal and infinitesimally brief existence swallowed in an eternal ocean.
The Universe has no beginning or end. Their was no Big Bang Period.

Ahhh, the James Webb Space Telescope is an AMERICAN product chump‚Ä¶ and don‚Äôt forget it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúworld product‚Äù it‚Äôs pure American ingenuity.
The JWST involved over 300 universities, companies and organizations around the world across 15 different countries. It is not an exclusively American product any more than you are an intellectual.
Do your homework!  13 other countries contributed to the design, engineering and construction of the JWST.  Not Knocking the good old USA - but please............give credit where and when it is due.
They do a good job of describing how fuzzy some of these calculations and hypothesis are....so many variables at play, and it&#39;s worth reminding ourselves we&#39;re still coming to terms with how far away Betelgeuse is with any solid accuracy, a star quite nearby.  The &quot;cold dark matter&quot; we&#39;re so excited to assume is one of the missing pieces to our observation vs. physics has never been observed, not &quot;dark&quot; as much as completely indetectable and a bookmark for future discovery along with &quot;dark energy&quot; which is just a way of saying we don&#39;t know what the force is that dictates the expansion in our observations.  Like dating human history using ancient pottery, things shift as our understanding changes.  I feel like good cosmologists and experts will constantly remind us of these fuzzy edges and unknowns.

Excellent ! A pleasure to watch, a demonstration of how entertaining Science can be presented.<br>My sincere thanks to Brian, the guests, and the whole production team.

Amazing talk! ‚Ä¢¬∞ Spoil the beans already! ¬∞‚Ä¢üòÇ Worth every minute of our time.
Brian I have been fortunate enough to watch WSF for many years now: thank you! This presentation is among the best, Im a Kiwi but Michele&#39;s passion &amp; communication is wonderful.
This was an excellent program that was both informative and excited the imagination. <br>All the guests were phenomenal; however I must say that Michelle Bannister‚Äôs enthusiasm radiates brings me a joy I rarely feel these days. She seems so delighted to be doing what she does, and is very effective at serving the viewer with digestible bits of her experiences that are still contain enough elation to be pleasantly intoxicating.
Passion!  This is the best embellishment of imaginative curiosity.
So exciting ! I won&#39;t be here for the next upgrade in 30 years but I can only imagine how wonderful it will be! Excellent conversations.  Thank You.
It is the awareness of some of the amazing things that science will be investigating,  but not for some time,  that I find to be the biggest misery that comes with being cognizant of our mortality. <br><br>There are so many fascinating discoveries that will change how we understand our universe,  and it&#39;s such a bummer to know that current advances in technology, which are already rapidly expanding our view,   guarantees there&#39;ll be so much,  that I would love to learn about,  that&#39;ll happen after I have shuffled off this mortal coil.
My feeling is black holes are just an expression of a fifth spatial dimensional direction. Traveling towards a black hole would seem like you are getting closer to it as the environment shifts around you to resemble normal universe, but it wouldn&#39;t get any closer. Just like, traveling towards SPACE from EARTH is directionally UP.<br><br>James Webb images in the early galaxy inspired this thought.<br><br>Warping of spacetime affects our observations, and we mistake that for reality. If a black hole bends spacetime towards a singularity, time also bends around it.<br><br>Black holes are likely just convex energies matching the universal concave.
Brian Greene is my superhero, my kind of celebrity! ‚ù§

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=4857">1:20:57</a> THIS lol. I&#39;m proud to be a democrat because democrats are statistically more likely to be highly educated compared to Trumpie republicans. It&#39;s not a coincidence. Democrats are more educated, we recognize science(for example on the topic of gender), &amp;we view all humans as equalü§ç
We can now know beforehand whether a possibly habitable planet has a housefly problem.
As I&#39;ve said before and will continue to say, the image at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=456">7:36</a> is NOT of gravitational lensing (at least not wholly). The dead give-away (and what should be obvious to anyone who fundamentally understands gravity) is the arc signatures and the presumptive focal center of mass for each definable arc representation given the claim of gravitational lensing.<br>It wouldn&#39;t be a stretch to suggest that if there is 5 baryons per cubic yard of space in one area and 2 baryons per cubic yard of space in another area on average (for example), that these minimal quantities of actual matter could not be detected at billions of light years distance and the interface areas between these dissimilar regions could be regions where light is channeled in another direction. Thus, a type of refraction (redirection we don&#39;t yet understand, possibly electro-magnetic, static polarization, quantum drag, muon interaction, etc.?).
Some media mention there are areas of the universe we can no longer see due to the expansion of the universe having caused them to be moving away from our region of space faster than the speed of light.   Other media, as this video does, speculate about being able to observe the earliest stars in the universe. ¬†<br><br>I‚Äôve always found it difficult to reconcile those two concepts.  If we can‚Äôt see to the outer edges of the universe, how can we be sure we are estimating the age of the universe with any precision?  Maybe that‚Äôs inherent in the math somehow, but I keep hoping someone will provide a clear explanation one of these days.
We are living in an age where the Universe has not yet expanded at a rate where we are unable to make observations near the beginning of the Universe. That time will come so we are fortunate to be living in this window of time.
@@mikotagayuna8494 Miko, I appreciate you replying.  I enjoy reading about astronomy and cosmology, but I also find them to be pretty complex and math-intensive subjects once you start getting beyond the bounds of what I think is a typical layman‚Äôs understanding.<br><br>The Wikipedia entry for Observable Universe notes that the inflationary theory of Guth, et al. ‚Äúsuggest that at present the entire universe&#39;s size is at least 1.5√ó1034 light-years‚Äîat least 3√ó1023 times the radius of the observable universe‚Äù.  It‚Äôs those kind of statements that contribute to my current confusion or misunderstanding.

@@LesterWayneDobos Certainly.  But I understand it to be one of the major theories in cosmological evolution and mentioned it to clarify my initial comment regarding the &quot;observable&quot; universe.
@@kevinc1956 Cosmology crosses my mind time to time.  The early galaxies being 10x size of milky way hadn&#39;t the time to form so huge according to big bang timeframe.

I get red shift. BUT. We all now know that light can be slowed by gravity. People keep telling me the speed of light is constant. The same people that argue for dark matter. The same people that tell me gravity is constant and a weak force. Yet in recent years the theoretical black hole is now proven. The fact that gravity has a wave function is now proven. Waves have variable intensity and because they are waves, variable frequency. My point is the energetic historical galaxies would have been massively gravity intensive on a wave spectrum. We should surely not judge the age of anything based on the speed of light when we cannot measure the effects of gravity outside our frame of reference. People also tell me that Newtons laws and General relativity accurately predict the motion of large objects we observe. No they dont. Newtons laws fall down when observing anything outside our &quot;solar system&quot; frame of reference. General relativity starts to break down when observing anything that is singular, be it super massive or quanta in nature. Im not sure we can ever truly understand the age and size of our universe without knowing which gravitational wave events took place, where, when and how big!!!
It&#39;s not slowed by gravity... It is bent to follow the gravity curve which is a longer path than a direct line.
Whatever happened, the Big Bang was super powerful. It‚Äôs typing this. Crazy

I have a question for the astrophysicists. Can we detect planets orbiting a star which has the rotational axis of the system pointed directly at the Earth? If not, how much does this limited the detection of planets?
The transit method is not the only method used to detect planets. Astronomers can also look for wobbling as a result of a planet&#39;s radial velocity as well as the bending of the star&#39;s light due to effect of a planet&#39;s gravitation.
@@mikotagayuna8494 Thanks for the reply. I had heard of the wobble detection method but forgot it. Wobble detection must be very difficult due to the size of the movement. I can&#39;t imagine how much the Sun moves in response to Jupiter&#39;s orbit but to detect that wobble at a distance of lightyears is mind blowing. Cheers.
I would guess , around a million people , working together , for a common goal the JWT......what if humanity , did the same.....? .
Wise words, keep spreading.
The advances in our knowledge of the universe since JWST became functional is nothing less than mind blowing. There is life on other planets, the only unknown is how much, there is probably intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy, again the only unknown is frequency.<br>As a 67yo one minor regret is that I may not live long enough to know for sure that life has been discovered on other planets or that intelligent life has been discovered elsewhere.
My guess is that we&#39;ll have a colony on Mars sooner than the life question is definitively answered...if it ever is.<br>I&#39;m in the same boat as you, only a few years further along life&#39;s journey.  At least we have eclipsed the entire history of humans in space to this point.
According to many NDE&#39;s I&#39;ve heard, it may be that we will know all after life here. If we live to see life found on other planets, that will be awesome, but if we then die and no longer exist and our awareness is gone, what&#39;s the point in knowing anything anyway? It&#39;s only a moment in time, a blip in eternity, and seems meaningless in the bigger picture if we don&#39;t carry our awareness beyond our physical life. Knowledge, memories, insight...none of it matters if it is extinguished after a physical lifetime. It would be pretty worthless. I guess it can be passed to living humans to advance things but eventually our sun will destroy our planet, the universe will expand, it will likely die and there will be no trace of our physical life, and no evidence we even existed.
‚Äã@@mygirldarby You&#39;re right. I have thought about this exact point. What&#39;s the point of knowing anything anyway? I don&#39;t know of any way of determining the answer to this for sure. But just because we can imagine the question, ie why are we conscious, is not an argument in support of the convenient answer, which is, yes because we are conscious our life must have meaning. The alternative answer is just as likely. It&#39;s 7AM and 15 deg C, what a bloody awful time to consider the question.
‚Äã‚Äã@@mayflowerlash11ifficult to determine what your actually pondering, but if you think life has meaning other than what you imbue it with, then I guess you&#39;re still very young; meaning is a philosophical question, not a scientific one; the inability to cope with my answer is the crutch called religion.<br><br>Consciousness allows you to ask that question, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a useful question, except perhaps at parties to get chats going with ppl you want to hook up with.
Curious to know if anyone here KNOWS that there&#39;s life on other planets, in or out of our solar system.  Please tell me that you&#39;re not waiting for disclosure from government
Having Brian Greene ask questions that we are not allowed to ask, seems politically biased.

Right?! Have you seen HiRise stereo imagery yet? (In vr)
Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis<br> <br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of mass?  Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the ‚Äúfabric‚Äù of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point?<br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn‚Äôt expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn‚Äôt require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it‚Ä¶
Good point üëâ
I don&#39;t believe in your imprint theory.  It&#39;s not as simple as a piece of metal bent and left that way.
Excellent! I can&#39;t wait to see the new discoveries.
As great as JWST is, it&#39;s not really an investment for humanity&#39;s survival.  <br>Pretty sad really.  Who&#39;s working on a NOBEL prize for ending war, or homelessness, or disease.  Seriously.
Incroyable
Brian, they will find within the next 24 months that there is no expanding universe. We may also learn that galaxies farthest away from us are actually smaller not larger. We will learn that the mass of &quot;things&quot; closer to us are larger than the mass farther away. This is why we THINK far-away galaxies that appear larger because we are comparing the mass of close items to have the same mass as the same items farther away. Items farther away are actually &quot;compressed&quot; the farther away it is. Imagine a fish that lives its entire life at the bottom of a deep ocean. There it is in equilibrium. A fisherman hooks one of them and pulls it to the surface where it bloats and eyes pop out of its head. It was compressed and then depressurized. This is the far universe.

I have a question, what if the universe was created simultaneously and set into motion. If this is the case then when we look at other galaxies from great distance&#39;s could it be that we are not looking back to the beginning but rather at a gallexy that is just so far away that it&#39;s light has red shifted simply because of it&#39;s distance. This would imply that the universe does not have an age at least one that we can comprehen as we cannot gauge it&#39;s size, depth, width, or understand all of it&#39;s intricate parts. This view has validity and reliability that perhaps could serve the scientific method of observation.

The passage of time is entirely derived from the movement of energy. Eliminate energy and there is no time. As the rate of the movement of energy is limited to the speed of light, the passage of time is metered by the speed of light, at least in the open Universe. The fact that humans were not around in the early universe, this does not mean that there was no time. The passage of energy through an unconscious universe was vital to the development of the kind of Universe that could support life and humans. The early Universe was busily making the heavy elements and dispersing them around space as dust clouds and chunks of minerals metals and water to make our world possible right here where we live,‚Ä¶.now. I love the biological expression ‚Äúwhat doesn‚Äôt kill you, will evolve and try again‚Äù, and this likely means that it won‚Äôt be an expanding sun that ends our time, it will be life itself. <br>This should help you see that there is no time travel. What is real is the now. We can predict certain aspects of the future and prepare for them mostly where the events prepared for are operating at sub light speed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2400">40:00</a> but where does this need for trascendence comes from? if we are just particles of the universe, and the universe has no need for stories or trascendence, where does this need comes from? that seems to point in direction to something beyond physics (physics as we currently know)
My comment below was for a previous video on &quot;science&quot;, and not this one, but anyone doubting that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza is either brain dead or dumb and blind.     Many thanks to SA.
Pardon the interruption of your narcissistic orgy, but the earth becomes Venus 2.0 in 115 yrs., if the European Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) is correct with their prediction that all of the planet&#39;s heat absorbing global ice will be gone by 2,138, or 115 yrs. from now, although it would appear that climate apocalypse may overtake us sooner than later.   All the rest is just BS and mental masturbation by narcissists.
If is all the motions of particles  causes consciousness why you smart people ones can not make any objects smart???
Our future relies on humans uniting instinctively!  Music, our international language, can Be intimately uniting!  Groovists believe we all now, can participate in our evolution!  As our reason for Being One of ten billion, we all must Groove as One!!!
Look, all we are is particles. What‚Äôs all this nonsense?

Great conversation...I really enjoyed it! I see that book is on Audible and it gets good reviews.
Simply listening to this makes my life more meaningful
Free will.... Is like how the ego can convince itself that it is the agent that is intentionally doing the breathing in and out when it&#39;s actually the autonomic nervous system. The ego thinks it&#39;s running 100 % of the show when really it&#39;s only running about 10% but the subconscious is doing most everything.
experience is waaaay more than words, i can describe fireworks to you but I can never make you feel the beauty of being at a fireworks show. i personally think that the brain reacts to so many different stimuli, some as random and absurd as the universe itself, that our &quot;free will&quot; and our sense of self has fundamentally infinite possibilities. it&#39;s crazy how much we can really think about if we band together
This is a good interview, not only Brian is brilant, but Faith salie is very well prepared,
It is accurate to assert that complex systems, such as weather patterns and human behavior, are not deterministic. This is due to the intricate interplay of numerous processes, even though these do not necessarily involve true free will. Particularly in highly intelligent beings, like humans or potentially future AI (should development continue), there is a manifestation of behavior that closely resembles free will. Delving deeper into this argument, one might question whether highly free-will-like behavior is equivalent to true free will. In my opinion, it is not. However, what is certain is that such behavior is decidedly non-deterministic. This represents a partial triumph over the concept of determinism.

Our fragile and fleeting existence bears the imprint of the extraordinary‚Äîa rarity that provides meaning to the fragility of life.

@user-kw8zj9zm5g<br>7 minutes ago (edited)<br>@user-kw8zjizm5g<br>from Byron vyron as victor victor<br>Its time to let my truth out and proof with evidence science proof soon, and that there is something else with us on planet earth, and it has family and friends around the globe and its the singularity of the universe life structure and its conscious and alive and I call it God, Light philosophy the very thing that made life on earth, and yes its the truth to settle your minds forever eternal in unity but it also favours the 2 sides of life and special life ethos
Dr. Greene, many thanks for your efforts! If I may ask a question...<br>In  Phys. Rev. 160, 1113 (1967) Bryce DeWitt, as well as John A.Wheeler in &quot;Relativity, Groups and Topology&quot; (1968) - they have developed the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a wave function of the Universe. Above all, they came to a conclusion that (in the case of so called &#39;mini-superspace&#39;) the wave function (a.k.a. amplitude of probability) does not depend on time. Well, but this conclusion is in conflict with our &#39;daily&#39; experience that universe in fact is changing with time. Thus, it follows that Universe (including US in it) does not change, and time does not exist, while We, the Observer, experience time within it and do observe the change... <br>Probably as laity in theoretical physics I am mistaken with this interpretation, but could you please give your interpretation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for wave function of the Universe. Thank you
Entropy is the measure of disorder and it always increases ... then why and how there was the &quot;order&quot; before ?
History tell&#39;s us we have had a polor shift. Did a compos point south or is the magnetic field always point to the north
This video is equal parts informative and beautiful, and I think that&#39;s largely a reflection of the 2 humans sharing the stage. Faith and Brian seem to complement each other perfectly... literally and figuratively. My only complaint is this: TOO SHORT. I would happily spend several more hours with these people. Just wonderful.

This is so awesome.  Here is a very intelligent guest having a civil discussion with a very intelligent interviewer. She asks a (that is just one) coherent question then stops talking and lets him answer. She listens patiently then when he is done speaking asks another question.  This is so sadly unusual these days.
It&#39;s that place beyond numbers...it becomes theory and not 3d anymore....
Eventually all math turns into theory and explores the undescribable....
According to Mario Livio we can predict the age of the Universe much more accuratelty than the age of a Human.
I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD QUESTIONS THE SAME WAY AS BRIAN HAS,WHY ARE WE HERE?,THE EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF LOVE,FEEL,HATE,COMUNICATE EACH OTHER,ETC,AND WHY ARE WE COSNCIOUS BEINGS? ETC ETC;AND I WAS ASKING THE WRONG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR  ANSWERS WERE SOMETHING LIKE:DON&#39;T ASK DUMB QUESTIONS OR HOW SILLY ARE YOU ASKING THOSE THINGS,AND FINALLY I&#39;VE FOUND PEOPLE LIKE BRIAN GREENE,ELON MUSK,LEX FRIDMAN,ETC,PEOPLE WHO HAS THE SAME QUESTIONS AS ME AND BESIDES SUPER SMART PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS,THIS IS &quot;AMAZING&quot;!!üëçüëçüëçüëç
It is so naive to state that there is no meaning in the universe while at the same time stating that it&#39;s just particles obeying the LAW! It seems that we are too anthropic to prove god or teleology doesn&#39;t exist, as we are too anthropic to prove it does.

He&#39;s wrong about free will. He doesn&#39;t account for our Devine spirit, which is not just particle motion.
If randomness exist, just like quantum mechanics predicts, and our consciosness is governed by the quantum theory then there must be some destiny thats beyond our mathematical models and that destiny is our free will; free of every previous knowlege.
She&#39;s a really terrific interviewer. She clearly read the book, has cogent questions, and articulates them well.
I have just started listening to the audio version of his book, narrated by Brian Greene himself. What a wonderful, thought provoking journey it is proving to be. I respect this man for his intelligence, dedication, and his storytelling abilities to make the mind staggering information of quantum physics understandable to one (me) who has no scientific background but does have a curiosity. Thank you, Dr. Greene. And Thank you, Faith Sallie for this program.
wow!!!
Time is a measuring device, just like a tap measurer measures the length of a board. Time is used to measure life and existence. time is just a form of explaining how things come and go.
I feel similar to the way Brian did about doing physics going through some dark moments or a tough portion of life. Thank You Dr. Greene, you will always be a motivation for me in life.

I have a question for Mr. Greene.  Does the universe knows it exists.
We are already aware of this information. It has been reiterated hundreds of times. Unless there are new scientific breakthroughs, no one will pay attention to these repetitions in the near future.
Excellent. One of the best conversations about physics and meaning I have watched
Well said Brian Greene.
It&#39;d be happier if the interviewer gave more appreciations to Brian&#39;s brilliant self-reflections instead of talking about her kid stories multiple times.
I&#39;ll never get over what an amazing speaker he is on subjects thats borderline impossible to comprehend for a lot of people

The interviewer, Faith Salie, is such a Manhattanite. Good fun, folks!
<i>&quot;Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity helped us to understand gravity&quot;</i> OH really then what about Karl Swarzschild&#39;s answer to Einstein in 1917?<br><br>BIG BANG Gravity Problem:<br>1.	Big Bang assumes energy and matter from nothing in a quantum singularity or fluctuation<br>2.	The density is quoted variously as extreme to infinite<br>3.	The total mass of the universe curves space and shapes the universes destiny<br>4.	Black Holes have an escape velocity at their event horizon equal to the speed of light<br>5.	The size of a Black Hole is measured by its mass which gives the diameter of the event horizon<br>6.	The mass of the universe is ~1e80 protons = 6.7e53 Kg<br>7.	The formula for escape velocity = (2GM/r)^0.5 Therefore r = 2GM/v^2<br>8.	Given M = 6.7e53 Kg and v = 3e8 m/sec therefore Dia = 2.r = 52.5 billion light yrs<br>9.	The universe cannot at any time have been smaller than 52.5 billion light yrs in diameter<br>10.	This is called the Schwarzschild&#39;s Radius of any mass and is well known<br>11.	Hence the matter in the universe can only have been created <b>after the expansion of space..</b><br><b>The Big Bang is falsified as a violation of the law of gravity! Q.E.D.</b><br><br>This is uniquely consistent with the Genesis account of creation of stars on day 4 after the expansion of space. Also <i>&quot;Let there be light.&quot;</i> on day 1 explains the uniform CMBR being a burst of photon energy with no mass.
If as he says <i>&quot;the truths of math will never change&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;once you prove a theorem in mathematics it stands forever&quot;</i> we know we did not invent it we only discovered it. Someone else <i>&quot;invented&quot;</i> it actually!
<b>Maths</b> <i>&quot;something we invent don&#39;t discover&quot;</i> If mathematics did not have rules that would sound ok. But the fact math has very specific rules tells us; <b>NO</b> we did not <b>invent</b> it we discovered it. It is one of the things that makes the universe understandable and one of the reasons we were designed to be able to understand it and give proper recognition to God who both designed and created it.
She is wearing a tablecloth, lol
I think this lady is a nut job.  Could she push his book any more than she did. OMG ....how nauseous.<br>And this guy is nothing more than a philosophical mathematician.
Such an intelligent man ,yet so wrong in the Free Will part. No, Vitalism has not been debunked by explaining away life ( which hasn&#39;t  happened anyway).There are mountains of evidence that science can&#39;t explain and ,in its modern reductionist version, never will.
Why is she screaming?
Watching this guy , my brain struggles to keep up. Is it better to live life in ignorance of the greater things we cannot control or just let these guys get on with it? How does he sleep at night with all these questions. ‚ù§
Every one here for brian wile i am here wishing i was faiths chair.
its still an unexplained gap - the experience of qualia is not evident in physics so perhaps a meta law is needed
About a year ago, I bought a bookshelf for my living room that really tied the room together. I had 5 shelves, and I filled one with my fiction books, and the bottom with my college books. I just ordered Brian&#39;s book here and am about to clear the random stuff I have on another shelf, and start my new nonfiction section. It will be here wednesday. I gotta read it first so that section will wait.
I love this man&#39;s knowledge when I realized that the Planet Earth does not need our presence at any level
great to have people like him!
10 second : the entire year = 1: 3,153,600. This is the difference between $1 and $3,153,600. A huge difference but I can comprehend and I can set plan to earn that amount in my lifetime. The entire history of universe is human comprehensible.

Random blobs of molecules trying to articulate the meaning of all this randomness.
Are higher dimensions earlier in origination than lower ones? If so I could imagine that since the earth kind of seems more roundy than the flatyness of the universe that maybe the earth type of time is different dimensionally than the universal type of time.
Amazing interview!! Best in absolute!

The Universe sounds so cool!  I must visit it come day.
I am perplexed, and indeed frustrated, that so many scientists choose to disregard Roger Penrose&#39;s rigorous demonstration that &quot;understanding&quot; must be non-algorithmic in character. Even if we speculate, with Brian Greene, that consciousness refers to             &quot;nothing but&quot; the working of some notionally complex procedure or system, then Penrose has shown that this supposition is by no means justified. (ie in terms of the procedure itself). It also follows that we may have genuine free-will, somehow associated with the workings of the brain, even though this principle is not understandable either as a deterministic or as a random process.
Euclid wrote the first scientific treatise on vision. In his <i>Optika,</i> we already find a decided emphasis on the traditional geometric aspects of the subject. Euclid contributed to our story in another important way. The seeming certainty and clarity of his <i>Elements</i> inspired Galileo, Newton, and Descartes in their drive toward a mathematical account of nature. Akin to the Greeks, they also sought to anchor their work in certainty. Now, unlike color and sound, the spatial and temporal dimensions of experience were seen to have an agreeable constancy or invariance to them ‚Äî and then, we have long had measuring sticks and clocks to measure space and time, so that helped them along immeasurably.<br><br>Today, we have accurate ways of measuring color and sound, but as yet no very good geometrical understanding of these facets of nature. We do know, however, that the spatial and temporal dimensions of things change with relative motion ‚Äî as do color and sound when they Doppler in or out, shifting toward the red or blue, depending.<br><br>We also know that colors and sounds are <i>invariant</i> or <i>symmetric</i> when under the same conditions, allowing us to engineer color TVs, computer monitors, as well as all the gadgets we have nowadays for reproducing sound. And then, as we shall see, we now know that symmetry governs everything going on in the universe, which is kind of interesting.<br><br>A second important thread can be traced back to antiquity. Greek atomism gave rise to the persistent notion that colors and sounds exist only in the mind, or as matters of opinion ‚Äî a dogma which continues to dominate scientific thinking today. Again, many intelligent people, Nobel laureates among them, will hasten to tell you that color is just the frequency of light. This nonsense gets repeated so often, it is of a piece with what ‚Äúeveryone knows.‚Äù (Try to discover who figured this out, however, and when, and where, and how that is supposed to make any sense, and good luck to you.) <br><br>The truth is that color has never been successfully incorporated into the body of science. Yet we routinely read in textbooks on quantum theory that the wave function contains, in principle, all that we can know about a physical thing. The author of the wave function clearly disagreed, however. <br><br>When not dabbling in quantum theory, Schr√∂dinger thought a lot about color:<br><br> &quot;If you ask a physicist what is his idea of yellow light, he will tell you that it is transversal electromagnetic waves of wavelength in the neighborhood of 590 millimicrons. If you ask him: But where does yellow come in? he will say: In my picture not at all, but these kinds of vibrations, when they hit the retina of a healthy eye, give the person whose eye it is the sensation of yellow.&quot;<br><br>So we have color and sound and the other &#39;secondary qualities&#39; of Locke. We experience them all the time, in predictable, quantifiable correlations with &quot;physical&quot; things. Where in the formulations of physics might we fit these additional elements of reality?
WOW Fantastic Video!!! Thank you Brian Greene and Faith for your fabulous interaction.
Definitely science is another religion but a very simplistic and dehumanized one...
My brain completely changed when i read michio kakus hyperspace book (made before i was born, 1990, yet people dont even understand any of einstines idias yet hahaha)<br>He doesn&#39;t even say the word dimension. I do and everone gets confused and i go down rabbit holes. It&#39;s really tough talking about science because I&#39;m so far ahead of everyone else. And all a them, he and michio kaku, me, everyone. But again, they never go down the rabbit hole, even though that&#39;s the monster not only in the closet, but also under the bed and all darkness out side in night, even when you turn the lights off. You have to address it. This dark matter is string theory. Its time and space, and we even have some math equations and laws, yet they are never talked about. There&#39;s so much, ... and he even kinda leans tord without a question, and answer is worthless. If you skip to the end of our book, everybody dies. Boaring.<br>The only religion worth teaching is string theory because particals are transdimensional.<br><br>But he says all there is is laws of physics and particals wiggling till they die. Yea being one with nature is cool, but if you cant get into that, get into what i say, be one with dimensions. Be one with string theory. They will all pass on. What makes our molecules are tied to us transdimensionaly, and then they all go away when time doesn&#39;t matter anymore. They go up a dimension. Time is a dimension.<br>Its more than just death, and its not religion. I believe in super string theory. Its been around for almost twice I&#39;ve been alive for. One day more people will be like me. I&#39;ve lived a tough life and nobody knows or cares, but i believe in something better than anybody else. In other words, get on my level bro.<br>Theres more forces of nature in lower dimensions. The more forces of nature are combined with gravity in higher dimensions. He even wrote that in his book, but again, thats not &quot;in sceen&quot; its not what the cool cats do. Therefore all u can do is buy his book and monitize knolage.

she interjects far too much
Growing up, I Never had somebody to look up to but Brian Green has become one of very few select that I do listen to and appreciate. I was lucky enough to ask him a question in Sydney two months back and it was an honour to do so. Thank you for keeping me interested in science and space. Your influence has made its way to the philosophy that I have been adopting while doing my PhD
Free will is not illusory.
How ludicrous, thought will come to an end? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Entropy is relative.
Time exists because matter exists. But God is not matter,  God created matter. Time began when God created the universe. Before that God was simply existing. Since there was no matter, and because God does not change,  time had no existence and therefore no meaning, no relation to him.   Even now time has no relation to God, he is outside of time, even though time and matter exist.
The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by hands. And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives men life and breath and everything else.
He is a worthy successor of dr. Carl Sagan.
Brian Greene is my source for time space and what not!   You keep me coming back to you dear Sir!  Thank you!
This interviewer is unbearable
The battle/coexistence between entropy and evolution sounds a lot like the coexistence of dark energy and gravity.

OK, I understood the sun to blame for thermonuclear destruction and we have no news about the war in Ukraine
I love science but the more I learn about the universe the more my faith is reinforced in the teachings of the Bhagaved gita. No religious scripture goes into the science of the universe like the Bhagaved gita. And the mathematical calculation for the age of the universe was first written thousands of years ago in the Bhagaved gita. Even Carl Sagan admitted that.
Yes, Very Thought Provoking.
His brother.....consiousness is fundamental reality.....In hinduism consiousness is everything......but according to him physics is everything.... And Iam really confused about everything
Respect your own Intuition.
Brian Greene is just SO ERUDITE !
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
i wanna r-produc- with that prtty body!
So is nobody going to mention the actual demon lady?
I can listen to Brian Greene talk all day, this man has so many brilliant ideas and his perspective is unique and I can&#39;t do nothing but have the upmost respect for that man
It&#39;s so nice to see Brian interviewed for a change.
They have nothing new to say...
Could we perhaps think that space has always been here.   Now perhaps this takes place all over the known and the unknown millions of megaparsects could this happen all over space
I do absolutely enjoy all of your  shows and lectures thank you for reigning my interest in  physics and just waking up the part of me that made want to learn.
Love Brian Green, his passion and enthusiasm is contagious
Fascinating
amazing guy......
Wonderful episode!  Faith - energetic, smart and beautiful and a great interviewer! Same with Brian! :) <br>Love from sweden!
Wow, the butt-kissing comments are especially thick here.
You could argue that there is something rather than nothing because there is no evidence for nothingness other than the concept/notion of &quot;nothing&quot;, constructed by our brain. The vacuum of space isn&#39;t empty. Even &quot;Zero&quot; represents the depletion of a measured quantity rather than nothingness. Once we can prove that nothingness exists, we can argue for it,.
Nice boots man.
A collection of particles does not do &quot;it&quot;, they do not emerge consciousness (imho). Why does the majority of this era just buy that story without doubt, like a religion, without noticing?<br>Matter seems not fundamental - or e.g. why &gt;90% dark &quot;matter&quot;, hahaha?

I wholeheartedly nominate Brian Greens as a deserving candidate for the Nobel Prize in recognition of his remarkable contributions to enhancing public understanding of the universe&#39;s profound realities. Throughout his illustrious career, Greens has demonstrated an extraordinary ability to communicate complex scientific concepts with unparalleled clarity and enthusiasm, making him an exceptional advocate for science and a driving force behind public engagement.<br><br>Brian Greens&#39; dedication to science communication has been nothing short of inspiring.

Oh guys, thank you! I enjoyed every moment of it!
When they mention the table, they are wrong. The table is made of atoms. Everything in the universe is made of atoms atoms is consciousness, so that table is conscious because it‚Äôs made of atoms.
Faith Salie was excellent. I confess I didn‚Äôt know who she was. Among other things (funny and engaging) . . . Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Magna.
Consciousness = not motions of particles, but motion of information carried by particles (or even without). This causes the emergence of complex meta-information?!
Thanks again.
Why is the universe not nothing? There is only one nothing, but there are an infinite number of ways something can exist. Therefore nothing is impossible. So the universe must exist.
Basic element of Time IS change.
I have questions : What is a dimension actually?  and another<br>what is the disturbance that vibrates the string in string theory?
It continues to bug me that Humans define entropy as having to do with disorder. Isn&#39;t disorder only a concern to us, or to the living, not to nature? Same thing with time&#39;s arrow, often described as being always forwards because we can&#39;t piece together a broken vase. But repairing so-called broken things is only a concern to the living. &#39;Degrading&#39; into &#39;disorder&#39; always seemed value-laden language. I always suppose these values are not shared by the cosmos &amp; that disrupts my understanding of entropy.
I don&#39; t see a contradiction between everything that Doctor Greene thinks, and explains so wonderfully, and the idea of an Entity  that might have created  these physical laws and the various particles ...I mean, the whole stunning immensity that surrounds us actually seems to REQUIRE it....
Free will = self determination and self ordering

Well Brian, there is a simple problem with this discussion of free will, we have no common and well defined definition of free will and that goes whether you are for or against the notion.

Damn, you guys are so bitter lol. I really enjoyed this conversation which took place between these two people so I acknowledged them both. Going out of your way to insult her says more about you than her

Agreed!

She‚Äôs not letting you hit brother üôè
‚Äã@@greenteapeng_  I share your opinion of Faith as quite wonderful, but I&#39;m curious about your offense at the other opinions: &quot;very average&quot; and &quot;represented the everyday person&quot;.  Why are those insults?  Do you believe the average person/host (i.e.: with statistically common attributes) is inferior to others?  If someone did find her to be average as a person and/or host, is there a way of expressing that which you would find non-insulting?  Or is the thought itself definitively, irrevocably insulting and its expression in any form disparaging?  Either or both of the other commenters might have simply been expressing neutral observations of their perception of her as similar to other people/hosts without judgment, ideas of inferiority/superiority, while still thinking she&#39;s lovely (average people can be lovely, too)...  And if so, then reading insult into their words would say more about your own biases -- <i>your</i> negative perception of averageness -- than anything about the other commenters.
You have a very average opinion ‚Äã@@dismalthoughts
I can&#39;t listen to her shouting

Good interview.
Would have loved to see Eric Weinstein sit in as a second sounding board (or moderator), even though that would probably be the last thing Brian might suggest for a more balanced discussion (leaving out the &quot;compost&quot; if you will).
Dear Professor so good to have you! my question what if you are wrong? any other ideas than it is cold cold cold like Dante&#39;s inferno @Smolin physics != mathematics ? Can you please both write some &quot;war time&quot; book together ?
After what Brian Greene said about The Freewill and the illusion of it:<br>I have questioned myself, my life and it&#39;s meaning, and the meaning of the whole universe?<br><br>But I still believing in Freewill, and I think that the double slit experiment and observer effect may be a reflection of our Freewill.
There is a generous amount of semantics at work in such arguments.
The only validity to such arguments is that there is a less than infinite amount of choices you can make in any situation, therefore your choices are already made.

Great guest. She did her homework.
These topics and exploration of the universe bring me a joy that nothing else can. I only wish I had friends who enjoy the same intellectual debates as I do so we can share our rambles and thoughts as we talk through the night.
Who cares how long humanity lasts?  It makes no difference.  The human race is so ego maniacal, when in fact our entire existence most likely means exactly nothing.   And no, it doesn&#39;t matter if we are the only &#39;intelligent&#39; beings in the universe, or ever have been, or not.
Mr Greene is amazing.  Very smart and yet very humble.  Totally unassuming individual.  Respect!
So, when does a cup of cofee rise without free will???? The answer is NEVER.
Beautifully done. It&#39;s not about legacy. It&#39;s about this magic moment we live in now. We all have won the cosmos of lotteries! This tiny moment IS enough. I&#39;m 74 and have had a lifetime of adventure on. land and sea. I&#39;m headed to the Alaskan Wilderness in August. Live to you die. Live life to its top. And please let me say this magic is where you are right now. You don&#39;t have to Sail to the Bahamas or live in the Alaskan wilderness. You are truely free to live now. Don&#39;t waste a breath. Change your self-story if you have to. Now go live. Throw my ashes into the Bering Sea right after my last gasp.
The interviewer had to much &#39;fan girl&#39; vibe going.   Her constant adulation to Brian was not very illuminating.  I am always irked when interviewers talk about how they cannot begin to comprehend the genius of those they are interviewing.

We want to get to the bottom of things. Science is the latest and best choice we have right now. Good philosophy can do it too. We are driven to get to the final whyy and how. Why do we do that?
Ego
@@debbino4249 Curiosity would be my first choice. But what do I know? I&#39;m not above it, I&#39;m in it.
Transcendence? Did Brian Green just agree to transcendence?
Many anthropologists and archaeologists agree that painting, singing, and drumming came before language. Maybe one hundred thousand years ago. Think Lalala ooooo. Lullabyes.<br>Also flutes made of tree branches...etc. art before language.
Excellent interview. I always learn new stuff from hearing Brian. He is a fantastic educator. Tremendous Faith and Brian for good 60 minutes.
Would anyone like to read about life having no meaning? Read Albert Camus. Mid twentieth century philosopher. The idea of no meaning is not new. He won the Nobel  Prize in literature.
If Brian is right about consciousness, there is no SELF. THERE IS NO I. Welcome to Buddhism and Hinduism.
My brain chemistry can allow me to make choices about how I want to do to change my brain chemistry. Part of what my brain chemistry can do is allow me to make choices between, let&#39;s say, a little bit of fun or a lot of fun. Both activities will increase my endorphins. But one will do it a better, so I choose that one.
Culture is susceptible to a type of evolution and entropy. When cultures start disintegrating/declining because of high social entropy, trouble will follow. We are at a point where our ability to destroy life on Earth is real. Cultural entropy is a major threat to all life on the planet.

You are expressing a belief. A belief is not a fact, no matter how fervent you believe.
What he doesn&#39;t seem to speak to is that 99% of all mutations are not favorable to a species and are completely unpredictable. Mutations occur randomly, and we have no idea whether they are going to be favorable or unfavorable to the existence of any given life form. Mutations are utterly random. See chaos theory.
If Jordan Peterson were a physicist... Speaking the Truth at every moment, with grace and respect.

Lest we forget, Newton thought science wouldn&#39;t exist by around 2060.
If everything is so ambiguous - consciousness. Imagine it being so debatable... Think about science itself, right?
I was going to say WTH, but I looked it up and you are correct.  Obviously Newton was a moron when it came to prediction, but then he was talking about Jerusalem etc above the date statement, so it&#39;s not surprising he went totally off into the weeds.
@@MrJdsenior He was a very intelligent man. He tried to decode the Bible as well.
We are so incredibly fortunate these days, to be able to listen to some of the brightest. Most enlightened scientific minds brought to us on YouTube . People like Brian and Sean, Carrol, and Richard Dawkins, in so many more. This kind of information was not really available before the Internet insights like YouTube. I really enjoy this kind of program.
Great interview.  Hope she isn&#39;t married.
Why?
She literally said she wished she was still dating. Came off a little thirsty.
Excellent and correct evaluation of the universe and reality. Just 3 aspects seem not clair:<br>1. Entropy: if a star is order and the surroundings disorder - that&#39;s 99% and 1% respectively and not the opposite.<br>2. in the far future how could the thermal leak of a thought be in the brick of causing disruption if by then the universe would be extremely cold and dark.<br>3. Free will: all human actions are expressed and enabled in reality by the the fundamental particles behaving as they&#39;re supposed to according to the quantum physics laws. They enable the process of action but are they the Responsible for the decision of raising the cup 0, 1, 2, .... times?

i live in nyc i walk through central park i have a daughter....god, how self centred and vain and off the point she is....
Top top top content!
Expanding left to right, north to south, what? Does the universe grow away from us, the Earth? The Earth is in the center, if so how centered? Our Sun?   I dont understand when we say the Universe is expanding... From what and where?  And what is it expanding into, how can something grow if it has no room to grow into or whatever?  I also don&#39;t know why the Term B. B. Needs to be so special to understand when we have our Bibles?  God says go and it doesn&#39;t matter how. I mean I&#39;m happy for us sure but we have much more to work on....   How do we know this is not first a concious experience?  All born by memory and mind power.  Nothing is we just think it is....and so what is relative?  Your mind will always be just as vast as this Universe. So what now?   Free Will, What about belief?   Is nothing more or less than what one believes?  Do you believe in free will?  And this is a letter, not a science show.  Yes you can think about free will in all the ways possible.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2980">49:40</a> that is why most find relief from: the majesty of existence, the shocking implications of the mundane, and the incomparable unlikelihood of the real -- in beliefs that muddy up the whole proposition and provide longed for reversion  to automatic functioning of the associative thought-centric and quite free-will devoid &quot;mind&quot;.  If the need to entertain any story, no matter how lame, becomes feverish, we could be in a good spot, we could be in a bad spot, dependent on the pointedness of our point of view. If things get too clear we can always turn on the TV, or read a metaphysical tome, or watch a YouTube video that stimulates associations we enjoy, or worst yet most soothing of all, simply reminisce with limbic seasonings.  Keeps things in homeostatic balance: that being the glacial progress, with the emphasis on stasis, that evolution favors so much on the collective level -- not that it will do us any personal good outside of antibiotics and such.

articulate , yes! true, maybe, I seriously doubt. He makes HIS points very convincing
This is odd having her interview someone like Brian. His intelligence is vastly beyond this interview level of simplicity. Its like he is explaining QM to a 8 year old child.
I don&#39;t see it that way
Aka most people
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2400">40:00</a> Some of those stories are failed explanations of the physical reality of the ignition of dormant possibilities within the nervous and limbic systems, as opposed to the versa visa.  All concepts about such, are misconceptions, and can be nothing else.  Or to put it simply: just because you are not talking or thinking does not mean you are awake, but if your are talking or thinking, it does mean that you aren&#39;t.  At least while you are thinking or talking.
Excellent
Free will? . . . humph!  Wait until a quantum computer tells you what your next thought will be.  Then talk to me about free will.
Their are conscious organisms, such as lizards and birds (while they are not sleeping at least), and their are self-conscious organisms (like some humans, who at times are aware that they are conscious, like now, now that I brought it up)  but there is no &quot;consciousness&quot; outside of the act of being conscious, anymore than their is a &quot;runningness&quot; while sitting and reading.  Another example of misunderstanding arising from the same old propensity.  And the propensity is found in the amazingly creative ability for the  associative thought-centric mind to create conceptual models that do not correspond to reality.  Therefore providing civilization, culture, and technology to all the little particleules like youses and meses.  If you like: associate concepts about it -- but you can&#39;t get here from there.  Even if for some reason you suspect that you want to, which you won&#39;t.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=1710">28:30</a> . . . <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=1776">29:36</a>  -- Because there is no nothing.  Nothing is only a concept, and a foggy one at that.  And we all know that fog does not qualify as nothing.  I think P. Crunk said something like that.
Tell me, &quot;When is now?&quot; and I&#39;ll tell you &quot;What now is.&quot;  There is no time exclusive of space, nor space divorced from time, except in the reification of an abstraction so common it goes unnoticed.  No big deal? . . . I know.
No matter which tags u inherited by birth ( race, religion, country ) its Impossible not to have respect and love for people like Brian Greene, Jeff Hinton, Elon Musk..
The way he talks about Entropy and Order is whack as shit. He is just dumb as shit. I wonder who hes benefiting from all of this. I was once dumb like you people here who thinks he is smart(back in 2020) but really he isnt. Order and disorder are BOTH the essence of existence and not one is over the other, but he says it as if Entropy is dominant and proceeds to give a shitty and childish example like the formation of a star is on itself &quot;bad&quot; since it gives up heats üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

1 + 1 = 2 IS NOT A GENERAL TRUTH.<br>‚Äî---------------------------------------------------<br><br>If one ponders whether there exists any system of knowledge no scientist, philosopher, saint or whoever has ever disputed, then what comes immediately to anybody&#39;s mind is the system of arithmetic operations. <br><br>1 + 1 = 2 is often quoted as the best example of an undeniable absolute truth. <br><br>But are these operational rules so certain?<br> <br>Consider the following observations: <br><br>Imagine you add one heap (=lot) of apples to another heap of apples. Then you must write<br><br>1 heap + 1 heap = 1 heap<br><br>In this case it is very right to say <br><br>1+ 1 = 1<br><br>Therefore the statement that &quot;one plus one equals two&quot; is only a conditional fact and not an absolute truth.<br><br>Similarly also other rules of arithmetic. <br><br>For example if you take two heaps of apples with two in each and two with three in each and make five heaps with two in each, then the statement <br><br>2 heaps + 2 heaps = 5 heaps, <br><br>hence  2 + 2 = 5   is also correct.<br><br>  Have you ever seen even a single table of arithmetic operations, where it is mentioned that accuracy of these operations are conditional? <br><br> On the contrary,  the rules of arithmetic are often quoted as examples of &quot;absolute truth&quot; even by most stubborn philosophers. <br><br>It is taught that different catogeries (or units) cannot be added (operated, in general), but here it is the same catogery (units) ~  &quot;heaps&quot; of the very same fruit,  normally used to explain (prove) &quot;one plus one equals two&quot; ~ alone is involved.<br><br>And when you add two cubes of sugar into your tea <br><br>1 +1 = 0 is also correct.

Things go from &quot;order&quot; to disorder. Great. Where does &quot;order&quot; come from then? Physics is a religion at this point
Brian Greene is trying to save his career after hawking string theory for several decades. But, sure, big news is coming real soon. Right?

Unless the evolutionary process ends with humans, which seems to be unlikely. It would seem we are destined to evolve into another species. Then, the battle we living beings have with entropy will eventually be won or loss by whatever beings we evolve into. Humans it would seem will cease to exist because hopefully they will evolve into a more advanced species.
Such brilliance and clarity. One only hopes and dreams, provided we‚Äôre successful and don‚Äôt disperse into an endless array of particles, where no 2 shall ever meet again, that when this all returns from wince time, space and everything came, that the consciousness that decided to randomly divide itself into particles, will remember everything, but not ever feel compelled to test the veracity of its own perfection again. But, what fun to remember everything, every particle, every star, every planet, and the lives of every being, in 360 degree technicolor consciousness, all that came about through its own division into creation. The awe and wonder never ceases ‚ù§
Brian is spectacular, I&#39;ve read all of his books and watched most of the videos on YouTube. Boy, will he be surprised when he dies and joins the universal cosmic consciousness in the  God. There&#39;s just no way that this universe, our consciousness. and everything here just a random collection of particles . It is a carefully designed place precisely tuned so it would be able to cradle life and us and where there is design there is a Creator üòä.. ps also the irony of this interview conducted by a lady whose name is Faith , didn&#39;t escape me üòÖ
So carefully designed that its creator had to send a meteor to wipe out the dinosaurs to let the mammals take over , so well designed that the creator kills children with cancer , so well designed it took 230,000 years for us homosapiens to discover the fundamental laws of nature , improve our understanding and in the process make the welfare of humanity better year in tear out , yet there is absolutely no evidence for a creator what so ever other in the minds of men .
Lol. You are an unthinker.
That was a truly excellent meeting of minds, with the ultimately perfect conclusion that it is about enjoying the moments that we get. Physics is one thing but animal biology is another thing altogether, but what a wonderful opportunity it is that we have the ability in our time to appreciate complex nature can be. <br>Brian‚Äôs wrong though on self determination. A rail track with a carriage, the track determines the range of possible positions the carriage can be, but the carriage determines which of those possibilities suits it best over time. We all have self determination with in the range of possible freedoms and time.
A conversation like this on a Saturday evening in Stockholm is no less than a cosmic blessing! Thanks, Faith, and thanks, Brian!
Very good explanation because people can not understand the relationship between atom and universe and human purpose and function..excellent i can say
The universe doesn&#39;t have a single age. There is no single rate of time or measure of distance in the universe. 13.8 billion years happens in the timespan of 6,000 years depending where you are. The expanded distance in our line of sight between galaxies causes redshift and allows for light to arrive from distant galaxies within our timespand of 6,000 years. There are no inflatons or dark matter particles and the universe is not expanding into oblivion for no reason. GR explains all of our observations such as superluminal motion and things moving faster than expected like the outer spiral arms of galaxies. When you observe a galaxy, it&#39;s not like looking at a cat. You are looking at differing measures of time and distance. Evolution is imagined. No physical thing can ever make or direct itself. Every physical thing is from a supernatural cause. Get used to it and live with it. It&#39;s the reality.
You said the magic word, history. You really need to study ancient history before trying to do science. You wouldn&#39;t be making yourself look so bad if you knew where we came from and why all humans are so similar. We are all the direct descendants of the sixteen original ancient civilizations. Humans went through a bottleneck from the climate change caused by the global flood that destroyed the entire world. It&#39;s the only reason YOU exist. You should be more grateful. Have you ever heard of Assyrians? They are the civilization from Asshur. How about Arameans? Aram. Lydians? Lud. Elamites? Elam. Medes? Madai. Thracians? Tiras. Cushites? Cush. Canaanites? Canaan. Europeans? Gomer. Italians? Tubal Mediterranean Sea people? Javan. North Africans? Phut. Egyptians? Mitzrayim. Asians? Magog. Siberians? Meshek. Jews and Arabs? Arphaxad. You are just making up stuff since you hate the truth in the Bible. Do you want to be ashamed and embarrassed forever? <br><br>There&#39;s more. The Cohen modal haplotype identifies the Israelite tribe of Levi that Moses and Aaron belonged to. So that means Arphaxad&#39;s descendants are everyone with the IJ paternal Y chromosome haplogroup, myself included, believe it or not. The Elamites are the descendants of his younger brother Elam that have the Elamo-Dravidian semitic H haplogroup. The Assyrians are the descendants of their brother Asshur with the G haplogroup. People with the F1 F2 and F3 haplogroups are the descendants of the two youngest brothers Aram and Lud. Then there is a peculiar Hamitic haplogroup in west Asia that is C. They can ONLY be the direct descendants of the &quot;house of Nimrod&quot;, the first king of the world who began building the Tower of Babel. These descendants have a CF SNP marker that they share with the majority of the world&#39;s population while the haplogroups of A, B, D and E of his younger brothers and cousins do not have it. <br><br>There is another Hamitic D haplogroup in Asia near the Denisova Cave and east all the way to Japan that is from the Canaanite tribe of Sinim which is the biblical name for China, hence the name &quot;Sino&quot;, which is also where the word Sinai came from. Denisovans incidentally are a mix of Hamitic and Eurasian lineages. Neanderthals are a Eurasian lineage. That&#39;s the reason Eurasians have the most Neanderthal DNA. The first people in Italy were the descendants of Tubal and today there is still 8% of the population of Central Italy with the K paternal haplogroup. Thracians are L. The Mediterranean descendants of Javan are T. European descendants of Gomer are R. The descendants of the Medes are Q. The other Asians are the O descendants of Magog. Siberians are N from Meshek. A, B and C are Cush (Nimrod is the son of Cush). E1, E2 and E3 are Phut, Canaan and Mitzrayim respectively.<br><br>There is no getting out of it, humans did pass through the bottleneck of the global flood that destroyed the earth. Our geology is the direct result of the global flood. If you understand this, then you can learn to be a good scientist. The Bible names every one of the sixteen of OUR ancient civilizations before they became civilizations. The God of Israel is the only true God.
Please keep working on that one. I&#39;ve been waiting for a good breakdown like that. Let us make man in our image to me also says, why do we need to know that here, or now at this point of the word? It just allowed in my mind plenty of life action in whatever forms before that was said.  So what happened before we were made in Image form?  I don&#39;t have mans begginings here, just modern mans.   And so far, no harm done because we&#39;re saying the Earth is this or that old and God loves science so who knows and science can tell should we be able to stay with it back far enough......   Remember also, anything can happen according to it&#39;s creator.   Those are great odds, take them.

We aren&#39;t anything, just a bunch of egomaniacal blobs walking around spouting goofy stuff like that to puff ourselves up, as if we mean anything AT ALL.  Carl was one of the most egomaniacal of all, just watch Cosmos and see what percentage of the time his giant talking head is on the screen.   Billions and billions...blah blah blah.
Brian&#39;s point here , is that we want the universe to have a purpose and meaning .We long for it to reciprocate our view of it . We cannot cope with the reality that it is just particles and molecules etc., and therefore , we must recognise that the parts of our life experiances that impact our soul are where we should actually invest the concept of meaning.

Many of the brilliant scientists in history were religious. We shouldn&#39;t create a dichotomy between the two. They exist in separate domains, which should not overlap as they contain different epistemologies.
Maybe religion is the manifestation of the &#39;Free Will&#39; problem referred to in this video.We need to believe we have Free Will because the reality of its absence drains our motivation to live.The need to determine our Fate, (when really we can&#39;t) , opens the door for &quot;Faiths&quot; that pander to this psychologically damaging reality. To cope  , many are willing to  ignore scientific facts for unproven/unprovable religious stories.Perhaps  those who don&#39;t need religion are not without Faith , but  actually just better able to cope with the  &quot;Free Will&quot;  issue.
@@kenadams5504 I would agree that believing in free will is a necessity. It not only provides motivation but allows for justice and morality. Without it a murderer can simply stand in court and blame the predetermined interactions of particles in his brain for committing the crime. We must live as though we have free will, regardless whether it is real or an illusion.
@@KAT-dg6el No - I said many were religious, not most.
@@ocean_0602 Of course , but , its also no harm to realise that the laws of physics apply to us in the same way as everything else that consists of particles and molecules. And , therefore , our belief of being free to determine our future is incompatible with the laws of physics .

Not exactly Big Bang but the cyclic expansion and Contraction of the Universe has been postulated by the Buddha 2700 years ago.
That is Interesting.
‚Äã@@j.k.d.126I mean, there are only so many possibilities: the universe can only either stay the same size, expand, contract, or expand <b>and</b> contract. Zero disrespect to the Buddha, but he had a 4 answer multiple choice question and got it right.
a cyclic universe is a dreaful miserable picture. if strictly true, it means we are going to repeat all the horrible suffering all over again. what a nightmare.
@@maxwelldillon4805 In fact, none knows that the truth is! Everyone (Buddha to modern cosmologists) is giving their opinions on the basis of fragmented data. The Universe is so vast and our life-brain are so negligible. That is why, Buddha did not want to give more time in such metaphysical questions. By the way, if you are a graduate in Physics you might have read that Big Bang does not really mean explosion but expansion. Yes, cyclic big crunches give the sense of unending suffering but Buddha also gives the concept of Nirvana (end of suffering). Later Buddhism (4th Century BCE) accepts the atomism but early Buddhism (6th Century BCE) more focused on classical fundamental particles of earth, air, water and fire. When all these fundamental particles are ceased then an individual attain Nirvana. However, even though the Nirvana Concept sounds logical or might be possible to achieve individually but in scientifically it is still not possible to demonstrate.
@@Alex-js5lg I would like to suggest to read Agganna Sutta (in Columbia University Website). Yes, I agree with you. There are several possibilities. I was stating Buddha&#39;s Worldview just to tell that when we talk about Cosmology and Consciousness we must not forget Buddha. Science should be secular. Science must not be Eurocentric. Buddha has great influence on Greek Philosophies, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese and Japanese world views.

Brian I‚Äôve considered the free will thing. I agree and would like to add a bit. <br>All of the chemical processes that take place within our brain an associated with them are summarized by their fundamental particles which exhibit quantum behavior. We are aware that means they behave probabilistic. This makes me have a different perspective. Maybe we still do not have free will. Because any outcome is possible, we perceive free will. Still bound by the physics as you mentioned.

Could it be that consciousness is an undiscovered property of matter that enables free will?
no
Possibly, if there&#39;s some unknown quantum aspect of consciousness. I can&#39;t imagine a way for consciousness to have a direct effect on matter through any classical mechanism. As far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s no evidence to actually suggest that the two concepts are related, but the fact that we don&#39;t understand quantum mechanics theoretically leaves the door open for consciousness to play a role in it.<br><br><b>If</b> (and I really just can&#39;t make that <b>if</b> big enough) consciousness affects quantum outcomes, then surely when millions of neurons act as a collective consciousness by firing in concert and affecting functionally incalculable numbers of quantum outcomes, it would seem to me that that would constitute some form of genuine free will.
Consciousness equals thinking and physics equals matter. Ram Chandra says thought was first created - with &#39;I am&#39; - and then, came fear (of separation).
Freedom is given to us. We are free. We have the free will. Why do you put the law of physics above the freedom? We many times correct the blind path of the law. Don&#39;t you agree?
There is no free will. You are a sheep.
Live in the present it is all we really have!!  Learn from the past and wish for the future.  I would have liked Faith to ask Brian about sitting comfortably in &quot;One&#39;s Own Personal Concisness Bubble&quot; in a crowded nightclub interacting with your friends surrounded by hundreds of people indifferent to your very existence. You get this irresistible urge to look in a specific location behind you and lock eyes with someone specifically checking you out from a distance. Personally, I wonder if this phenomenon has some connection to the observer effect. Thank You!! for the discussion.
God Is all around us people. He interacts from the quantum world and collapses the wave when we get too close. We&#39;re not as smart as him. Have faith Love him and Love each other. God Bless
Brian talks about the romance of math, I only wish I had his experience. I had the opposite experience, math was torture, punishment, etc.. and therefore unpleasant. Yet I always knew in my gut that mathematics was clearly amazingly useful for our lives. So I&#39;m super glad math nerds are with us! Thanks to those who really get it and share their expertise so we can have the chance for survival.

@@mokujin29 yes, no doubt it helps to have an interest in the subject matter. I prefer the written language and have cultivated my writing skills over mathmatical ability.

@@issyjas3309 I think that many &quot;math teachers&quot; at the high school level and especially below that, really have no understanding of what they are teaching outside of having memorized the maths.  If you ask them what practical use some equation may have, a lot of them will have no idea even though they know how to solve it.  Many people have trouble being interested in, and/or learning, something that is just memorization of rules without any info on how and why it was developed and is used for.

@@SkyRiver1 100% this.  Many can&#39;t even articulate an alternative way of working a problem out.  They know the one way the text shows and that is the extent of their knowledge.  I went from being a gifted math student in middle school to failing grade 11 math because I went from naturally understanding to being taught to regurgitate memorized equations.
I like how Brian Greene and Max Tegmark both have the same idea about how we are all just particles.  I was really entertained by this one.
A stupid, futile statement that should impress no one with a modicum of intelligence

‚Äã@@smlanka4u &quot;JWST discovered galaxies older than the Big Bang.&quot; It&#39;s crucial to understand that galaxies being &quot;older&quot; than the Big Bang is physically impossible. Initially, the observation was indeed surprising as galaxies were detected earlier than our models predicted. However, the case of CEERS-93316 was reexamined; originally identified at 250 million years after the Big Bang (redshift z‚âÉ16.4), spectroscopic follow-up revealed a redshift of just z=4.9, around 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. This discrepancy was due to three overlapping properties that simulated the expected colors of a galaxy at z‚âà16 in the analysis.
‚Äã@@otinanisweirdo
‚Äã@@smlanka4uAlso, your statement about black holes growing without absorbing ordinary matter leading to the possibility of a Big Bounce is not supported by current scientific understanding. While black holes can indeed grow in ways other than absorbing ordinary matter, this fact doesn&#39;t directly correlate with theories about the universe&#39;s end or the concept of a Big Bounce. These are intricate topics that can&#39;t be connected in such a straightforward manner.
Wu wei, &#39;ya got it.
How anyone could think it would have been somehow easier, more natural, more logical, etc. for there to have been a fictional metaphysical &quot;nothing&quot; than the &quot;something&quot; everywhere in front of our eyes is beyond me.

I mean, the exact movements and patterns are all part of an apparent equilibrium which seems static in small scale but it&#39;s dynamic in a larger scale. So pretty much nothing has order in the grand scheme of things. Just random stuff. We only look for patterns so that we can do math on it.
Always look forward to any nuggets of truth ‚úùÔ∏è from Brian Green.

Respected British anthropology professor, Dr. Edward Dutton, has demonstrated that ‚ÄúLEFTISM‚Äù is due to genetic mutations caused by poor breeding strategies.<br>ü§°<br>To put it simply, in recent decades, those persons who exhibit leftist traits such as egalitarianism, feminism, gynocentrism, socialism, multiculturalism, transvestism, homosexuality, perverse morality, and laziness, have been reproducing at rates far exceeding the previous norm, leading to an explosion of insane, narcissistic SOCIOPATHS in (mostly) Western societies.

I think the concept of the &quot;end of time&quot; refers to a point far enough into the heat death of the universe when no meaningful interactions can occur. That leaves no way to distinguish the difference between moving backwards and forwards in time. So it&#39;s not that time literally ends, it&#39;s that it becomes kind of meaningless/useless.<br><br>But agreed - it should be interesting!
Its not an error, it is &quot;literature&quot;!
I am not really concerned about what any particular person BELIEVES.

If dark energy were moving through the universe like heat through water, mass should be brought together like foam on the surface. That would require dark energy to move faster than light, maybe with continued influence from the cosmic origin on mass. Or for a strange geometry in time space
I&#39;m confused.  Much of this discussion centers on the idea of demonstrating that gravitational waves exist - in the first place.  But didn&#39;t Taylor and Hulse already demonstrate that in 1974 using pulsar timing measurements at Arecibo with sufficient credibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1993 ?
Dr Chiara is amazing, to be so elegant, clever and explain things so well.

Beautiful people. Beautiful ideas. JF lovely!
An interesting subject for me would be how strings might be in the early universe &amp; whether they have any tendency to clump (build into a quark).
Spacetime does not contain mass or energy. Why does its waving carry energy?
If we cannot see the dark matter, would normal matter be visible from dark matter point of view?
Without Dark Matter the galaxies would not be in place. It holds them together‚ù§

Professor Greene it is such a pleasure to watch these. I will never waste a minute of my life thinking this world is simple and boring. Society has come between greatness and I for far too long. Here I come.
Is it a gravitational wave if the object first comes closer and then goes further away. I observe from afar, does the strength of gravity vary? A normal thing like the tide in the phenomenon?
üôÉüôÉMaybe the universe is not expanding maybe it is us and our measurements that are shrinking.
Interesting how gravity n dark matter/energy affect each other?
Charging a single eggcelle with 0,0002% nano Mandohurts, before combining the following of a single sperm cell dropped at 5 hours intake attraction point from a black hole is plenty enough impulse map vibration for the sperm cell to find the egg on the third side of space, however the expansion after they meet increases the dark ecco in such a way that it rifts up 2 meeting&#39;s galaxys, so is it possible to bend the time with a split in the end so it soften the acceleration when they meet, without using darkyears as measurements ?
I have to say it. The dark matter filiments resemble a neural net.
Thank you! Appreciate  your brilliant Narration surge of expansion etc.. Gives me a window of insight on your cosmology explorations with your telescopic lenses with its varied tech progress! To answer &quot;Why&quot;? ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§for sciences matters Thank you!üòÆ
It‚Äôs enjoyable to see how excited they are discussing these topics. Fascinating stuff when you are in the right frame of mind to truly listen.
great leacture
In my view the phenomenon of gravitational waves indicates that space time is compressible. This indicates that space time has a variable density. I would expect that density to increase in the presence of baryonic matter so that a large amount of mass will bend the path of light in the same way that light passing through air and entering water is bent. I think that Einstein used the wrong terminology to describe this effect: mass does not curve space but rather compresses space. This may indicate that matter doesn‚Äôt exist within space but rather it displaces space. Therefore the larger a mass is the more dense the adjacent space will be.
It is not science. It is pure fantasy. And, yes. I am waiting for cosmology fanatics who will tell me that I do not understand mathematics behind these &quot;theories&quot;.  Theories without any way to be tested.
Dr.brian Greene is the inspiration and one of the revolutionaries of science field who is increasing the awareness about importance of science.
We have no idea what dark matter and dark energy are.  Physicists have ‚Äúfudged‚Äù the formula to get it to agree with what they observe.
In a corner of his house, Dr Brian Greene hosts the most coolest physics forum there is! I only have one question as the result of watching this gravitational discussion.. Is a black hole made of dark energy/matter?
Hi, you could just have a laser source in sphere with bilateral minimal blind spot and achieve the same thing on a smaller scale.
Indians are only contributing scam data and Chinese are only contributing fake data üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How can the fabric of space and time be moving but we are not? This makes zero sense to me
Are we magically exempt from the laws of physics when it comes to gravitational waves? Do we say the Earth is travelling in a straight line as it orbits tthe sun? What the hell is she saying!?
Keep watching Minecraft videos and worshiping whatever clown promises you an afterlife. If you&#39;re genuinely curious just google it you goof.
If black holes absorb other black holes is it possible that they also absorbed the original star the first black hole of the culmination field supernova&#39;d from?

Is anti-matter something that could be in between dark matter and matter? If so would dark matter absorb velocity before matter up until a limit before matter can react?

Is it possible that there is a space that is preexisting that our universe is expanding to fill, and what looks like a force pushing out and expanding the universe is actually a vacuum pulling out?
Thank you Dr Greene! I&#39;m just a regular guy who works in a factory, but the nature of reality is very important to me. Thank you for bringing this data and these ideas to people like me.
We are all just regular people trying to understand shit. Job and social status are not that important for the desire to understand these things in my opinion.

I&#39;ve been reading Brian Greene for don&#39;t know how long, but <i>seeing</i> him visibly enjoy the same topics that intrigue us, too, is another matter, a <i>light</i> matter.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJuOQWCyMAc&amp;t=1934">32:14</a>  One of my puppies did that tonight, but he also snapped his leash. So, naturally, I&#39;m wondering whether or not spacetime or its fields could snap from the tension on them? Would they form new loops of the string, vibrating at new relative frequencies and so as different particles?
Excellent interviews, so informative. Dr. Greene brings out the best in his guests.
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
... or at the  <i>very</i>  least we start looking/thinking in these other ways, or directions.<br><br>ive become more and more disappointed over the last 20...30 &#39;odd years because of the unwillingness to even think in these... other ways.<br><br>admittedly its taken me most of that same time to open up to them,<br><br>I was very &#39;science only/has all the answers&#39; based and unwilling to examine these &quot;so called&quot; fringes<br>but, if honest they are just other ideas /points of view and in many cases being thought of, or believed in for much longer.<br><br>i sometimes wonder if this build up of &quot;dark matter /energy&quot; (2 other words for... we don&#39;t know)<br>is the &#39;manifestation&#39; of the enormous amount of information  we have generated in the last few hundred years<br><br>painted onto higher dimensional &#39;shaped&#39; objects that we can only see/interact with the equivalent of a shadow, or reflection of our &#39;every day&#39; objects<br><br>a reflection/shadow of something having vast amounts of near massless, but seemingly correct information about the objects<br>but only when viewed in a very certain way<br>like slices of the 3d object does when viewing in flatland/lower dimensions...<br><br>I hope that makes some sense üòä

I&#39;ve been posting this story for a while, now.  Is it possible it&#39;s related to gravitational waves?<br>Time is fascinating. I worked the subway stations for nearly 10 years. From one end of the city to the other. Every so often I would notice the city would be saying that, &quot;Today just flew by&quot; or &quot;The day was just dragging along.&quot;¬† How can an entire city, with no interaction with each other until they used the subway, complain about the same time paradox unless it was effected by it? Maybe a time distorted bubble the earth passes through in its revolution around the sun. Maybe random waves of time distortion hitting the earth? Maybe they&#39;re given off by the sun. Maybe they&#39;re from outside our Terran system and reach us in intervals. ???? Ti-i-i-ime, is on my side. Yes, it is!<br>If you can think of a better way to do a blind survey of an entire city, in the small window of opportunity, I&#39;m all in.¬† Until then, I invite you to spend a couple years in the subways, during rush hour and you&#39;ll see for yourself.¬† Just listen as an entire city gets off of work and gets out of school.¬† You&#39;ll see it&#39;s more than a, &quot;coincidence of circumstances.&quot;

Then there&#39;s Outside the Local Group time bubble.¬† So on and so on until we get outside any influence and into the, &quot;True Interstellar Time Standard.&quot; Or, &quot;T.I...&quot; ;-P<br>Now that &quot;V-ger&quot; is outside our Sun&#39;s reach, in interstellar space, it&#39;s now in the Milky Way&#39;s faster moving, Interstellar Time or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;¬† This can be proven by turning off everything except its clock and transmitter.¬† Have &quot;V-ger&quot; read time for as long as possible.¬† They WILL show the flow of time speeds up the further away you get from any celestial bodies.¬† Until you reach the Milky Way&#39;s time standard or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;<br>‚Ä¢Our sun&#39;s time bubble: &quot;Terran Time&quot; we know and have measured.¬† In a lifetime, our head is one second younger than our feet.<br>‚Ä¢Milky Way&#39;s time bubble or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot; The rate/flow of TIME outside any influence but within the Milky Way: We just got there and are still figuring what the difference is.

Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis <br><br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of matter? Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can also be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the ‚Äúfabric‚Äù of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point leaving pockets of inelastic spacetime geodesic that cause gravity without the presence of matter? <br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn‚Äôt expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn‚Äôt require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it‚Ä¶
Why only two arms for LIGO? Wouldn&#39;t a ‚Äú3D mesh‚Äù of arms give us much better detail? Surely we could separate out the direction and magnitude of the waves with an array of detectors.
A Fan Causes Ripples In The Air, But Could Also Be Like A Reptile Shedding It&#39;s Skin In All Directions And More Frequently?!?

Oh nonononono. Again,
In a tug of war game, both of team members are on the same ground (same plane).  What about tug of war in our solar system?  Are their orbits on the same plane or changing time to time?

Welcome to the PTA meeting.
Why are those scientists shaking their heads so much? Does this help with thinking or are it the gravitational waves?
So gravitational waves are not effected by time dilation?<br>When two BHs are merged, time is slowed down relative to the earth.  Like a movie &quot;Interstellar&quot;, one hour on the planet next the BH was 7 years on the earth relatively.  So say it took 2 seconds at the last moment of the merge and we here on Earth detected it.  It&#39;s still the same 2 seconds?  No time delation?  Would that mean there&#39;s no &quot;red-shift&#39; because of the expansion of the universe, spacetime?
Lies and propaganda...Good luck

Gravitational Wavea aren&#39;t real. Famously, scientists even aren&#39;t clear yet what is gravity itself...
neat!
Brian greene is one of my favourite physicist and I eagerly wait for his videos as they give us an edge to think over the research related ideas ...He is one of the best and amazing speakers.
Gosh, Brian has to be the hardest working physicist. Bravo ‚ù§
Happy day, happy day! Thank you Dr. Greene!
Roger Penrose suggested that in our universe there could be Gravitational Waves from Black holes coming from a previous universe in the very far past. If such a previous universe Existed and if Black hole morgens emitted gravitational waves: could these waves be measured with the Neutron Star method? Or would such waves Still be beyond our reach and not a Potential source?
How wonderfully blessed we are to live among such brilliant Minds <br>who continually and doggedly peel back the many layers of secrets <br>our Universe holds.  Stunningly impressive and inspirational work.<br>Thank you Prof. Greene for introducing these amazing people to us.<br>Chiara is a very talented science communicator.
Also, how counter-intuitive is it to hear something as compact as <br>a neutron star be described as &#39;squishy&#39;, but that black holes <br>which are essentially extreme gravitational wells in spacetime, be described <br>as being &#39; hard &#39;, and not deforming under these extreme conditions. <br>Mindblowing stuff.
I&#39;ve always been curious about the structure of the universe, like if we could map out the universe in an I instance of time, mapping light years. What would that look like
Lets suppose that the universe is an entity that would cause gravitational forces to other objects outside of itself. if that gravity couldnt go anywhere, what would happen? if it is able to impose itself outside of the universe what would happen from our perspective? is it possible that time itself is another form of gravity like xrays are another form of light?
A solar system sized black hole.. orbiting another black hole the size of our solar system... That&#39;s some serious imagery. Even though we don&#39;t know why gravity is. I love you world science festival

Thank you, most interesting, I hope to travel to NYC in September.
I miss those long Q&amp;A Brian that you did during the pandemic <br>Feel a nostalgia for those days.
As a layman in this area ... <br>I understand that two orbiting masses should spin arround each other forever ... but they loose velocity and collide and one way they loose that energy is by dispersing gravitational waves. Is this correct? If so it then implies that energy is required to change the state of gravity. It also implies that there&#39;s a direct similarity between electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves. It&#39;s just at a different scale.
Oh shoot! I missed being here when you were live.  So glad to see you doing these again!
I want to formulate a new theory of the existence of a particle that ensures symbiosis of a biophysical system, considering it to be a first step in accommodating this great flow of energy, which follows to be assimilated through applied technology. Thank you!
Thank you Brian, your team and guests for another wonderful session. I am very much just a layman but I have always thoroughly enjoyed your work and I  appreciate the work and effort to keep the broader public informed on the cutting edge of subjects in science in general, especially the physics and cosmological topics.<br>Thank you from the UK.
Awesome! Best start to my Saturday morning walk
Hi Brian... Regarding reversibility, it is a very important topic, what makes the transition between the relative dimension and a new dimension of resonance energy, being considered  that a system of human accommodation with the environment. It represents a symbiosis of matter to future conditions of existence.Regarding gravitational waves, it is good to understand this inexhaustible source of energy to be assimilated by technology, to be supported by living matter, the conversion of this energy gravitational, in resonance energy that can be used in different fields of activity. Regarding the black holes of the Universe, I consider them to be the accumulation of large amounts of energy,in a perpetual transformation, this wonderful event horizon...respectively I consider it to be a great gravitational potential, a great amount of energy in a continuous transformation...Let&#39;s remember the bell effect, which provides both the sound effect through resonance, but also the disinfection of a biophysical system, but also of the respective environment. The same is true of these black holes, which through this bell effect ensures the cleanliness of the Universe Thank you!

I Really like the idea of space being a partical
Very eloquent presentation! Although i would be curious mister Greene to hear your real point of view on a foundation that it‚Äôs main goal is to blur the laypeople about a non existing relation between two incompatible identities‚Ä¶
I still have no idea what cosmic strings are ^^ I wished he would have used more a mathematical description. Now, I am not sure if he talks about topology or geometry or fields or if it just was a nice image.
Here we study in space, gravity, etc. What could and should be right. So, what exists?  What is everything already?   Think about what we study in that of which we create.  If we create those waves themselves, then what can we do with them.   Like poop. If we make poop, what can we do with it?    Where is the Earth located in the universe?   Are we on one end or another?  Are we in the middle of it?   Is there a map to the universe inside our heads yet to be discovered? How can we put one there? Can you download a memory, what would that consist of and look like, for me in my minds eye, and for others by using technology and things?   Question is,  why travel in the universe using material kind, if we can utalize our minds and do so too?  Perhaps a hybride type of control would be sufficient.
Hi Guys; what&#39;s the force carrier for the G wave and/or the medium transferring the wave energy across space? Please disregard the headlights and get out of the roadway.
Dark energy is clearly a particulate coupling effect where high z clusters show common disk galaxy plane orientation with the same  axis extension in the direction of red shift propagation. The galaxies are exhibiting a &quot;windsock effect&quot; forcing the disks into the laminar gravity flow that couples with the baryons to extend orbits in the direction of red shift. This concept of a laminar flow of quantum gravity is consistent with a gravity working fluid that has diminishing effectiveness as gravity while increasing its effectiveness as the space-time viscosity working fluid. I.E. fast gravity creates gravitational propulsion while slow gravity increases space-time viscosity that manifests as dark energy. The Hubble Constant just measures how much of the gravity flux is slowed to impotency over a megaparsec.

JWT IS SO IMPRESSIVE. What many may not realize is that IF EXOPLANETS are found Say - 1/3 of way across the Galaxy (Milky Way) - That Planet&#39;s Light has been traveling to Earth for 30,000 to 50,000 Years. A lot could have happened since then. For Galaxies Millions of Light Years away, that could be a lot of change...or evolution.

The notion of life needing water on planets where liquid diamond rains, in wildly different environments than Earth seems biased and unscientific.
:)
Dr Greene is such a great host and presenter. I think his most admirable quality, besides his intellect, is his low ego. He doesn&#39;t have to act like the smartest person in the room (cough cough Neil deGrasse Tyson) and let&#39;s others teach him (and us) in a very comfortable and non combative way.
Generally speaking the smartest people in the room usually don&#39;t mind not being thought of as the smartest person in the room.  Only those who have egos with something to prove are the ones who need to be known as the smartest person in the room.

allin rimay Brian
A few things. She keeps saying dust ice clouds? Those all are biological processes. Dust is organic, ice is frozen liquid water or transition metal, and clouds of particles?  4 seasons ? You only need four season if you have a plant cycle or something similar. Also she says they have to proint the telescope at a Star first to the capture an image of Neptune/Uranus.. lol. The truth is all between the lines and poor use of words as descriptions. In or outside the lexicon of Astrophysics and Asto-Bio-Chemistry.
OMG, all they show are simulations, cartoons. DID WEBB BLOW UP?<br>ANSWER ME THIS<br>Since galaxies travel in space time as they cross the universe, emitting light along the way, then we should be able to observe the same galaxy at different places in the sky, different places in the life of the galaxy and universe, by figuring out the direction of the galaxy and its speed, then mapping the universe forward and backward in spacetime and making observations there. IN OTHER WORDS,, as an example, If Galaxy A is observed to be 1 billion light years away when the telescope aims at in say in Andromeda, and we could extrapolate or guess which way it came and/or which way it is going then we could find it elsewhere in the sky, say at 2 billion years ago, and half a billion years ago. WHERE IS THIS WRONG?
Sorry to say that about the space water , when the creation of the earth God separate half of the water on Earth and the half to up side and the middle place is called space see Bible (Genesis 1: 1-8) <br>this is made on second day here the earth is having water but the upper water , the earth is made by 24 hours 12 hours day and 12 hours night but to know sky water actually while creation God added.2 more means 3 planets or something like this that these are the numbers 10 and 12 for 10  is 25 or 55 and 12 is 26 as 66 each one is having the separate meaning and to tell about 10 and 12 called J and L means in Indian language water and normally where the water there must be fish so 25 is as 55 and 26 is called 12 here 5 5 12 called EEL the name of the fish the secret is after number 10 the next number is 11 and 12  is as in neumaralagi 1 is A so 10 11 12 as  J AA L means in Indian language Hindi meaning net the fishing net so we must know that there is water  and normally the place is called God place where God is sitting on the 11 the number is invisible the size is as  each one is the length is 18 and the width 12 as each 29 and 26 as called 1290 and 1260 and 1290 1260 as 49 is 9999 =36 and 46 is 6666= 24 as the same earth measurements and each number that is 11 is having the name called Jehovah and Boez means Jesus Christ see Bible ( 1Kings 7::15) and right side J  left side L the Jesus Christ and the Lucifer sitting so this is called the thrown of God and the Earth is God&#39;s threshold hold thanks

She exuded all the excitement! Loved this conversation!
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
Max was on some very good drugs at the time, and in one hell of a &#39;we&#39;re everything&#39; circle jerk.  Masergy is an old concept.  Gravity creating particles seems far fetched, and  it being conscious is absurd.  Mankind thinks it&#39;s the center of the universe, making goofy statement like &#39;we are the universe trying to understand itself, when in reality we are, in total, probably completely inconsequential.

My theory on how the earth got it&#39;s water; which I will call &quot;theory Z&quot; is that earth started out as an icy comet about the size of the moon, gets trapped in this orbit that then got bombarded by rocks and other debris which sank into the melting ice. Besides; how can you account for the 70/30 ratio, which to me sounds absurd, that all these so-called icey comets deposited all this water????
Not so comfortable with your theory, <br>I&#39;m also studying, about it
Thank you, Dr. G. You attract the most interesting guests for the most interesting subjects. This has been one of the best. Dr. Milam is an excellent communicator with a deep knowledge of her subject. Thank you both.
Not showing us the images you are talking about really sucks
Earth&#39;s water came mostly from the Sun: protons reached Earth&#39;s oxygens and still reaching and producing water in Earth&#39;s atmosphere.
LISTEN KIDS (in short, the real world has two fields who form one particle electron=photon: magnetic is perpendicular to the plane of whirpool which produces electric field falling into that whirpool and emerging as magnetic field), THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS REVEALED IN THE YEAR 2000 (I just needed to learn English to transfer it to you): electron is photon (electron is a real atom which is a manifestation of electric and magnetic perpendicular fields like whirpool or eddy or black hole), left and right electrons form neutrino, gravity is uncompensated (or relativistic) electric field of proton (smaller particles consist of bunch of electrons and gravity there is called strong and weak force/field), proton consist of approx 2000 electrons, neutron is electron plus proton, light has no colors since it is a bunch of photons at various distances between themselves traveling in the same direction like thrown sand particles in the air, the red shift is not only due to Doppler effect, but and due to spatial dispersion both due to angular divergence and due to absorption of some photons by matter particles on the path (overall effect is red shift, like averaged distances between photons=electrons falling on averaged areas gives a sensation of frequency and color), a single photon has got no frequency. Universe is INFINITE and ETERNAL, we just cannot see (and will never be able) very deep in space since the lack of PHOTONS reaching us.
So maybe a lack of water is why life is so rare in the universe?

Of course our solar system is unique Brian, it‚Äôs the only one we know of to have life.
That doesn&#39;t mean that it is unique at all.  The thing that would make it unique, by definition, is if it were the only system where that is true, and we have no way to know, either way.  I expect that solar systems with life are literally a dime a dozen, and unlike ours some probably include intelligent life.  <br><br>I propose that ours does not, since the only species claiming to demonstrate signs of intelligence is crapping in the only kitchen it has, and maybe to the point already where the end is nigh, not today or tomorrow, but not that many  years away, either.
AWESOME !!!!!!  üëæ
We learn at a fast pace today one answer in Physics leads to more than a hundred questions and yes we are leap-frogging our knowledge of the Cosmos the major factor is that we have JWST to quantify what we think we are really looking at what it means to us for our future, The Cosmos is like a super colossal pinball machine things come in and things disappear in microseconds I hope what we find out is accurate enuff to help us make the major changes to our knowledge that we need to survive and maybe keep our planet Earth in the condition that helps us. I truly love the interest and comments said here.
Where did the water from mars+atmosphere go to?

Do we have rings around Earth such as this that are detectable with James Webb telescope ?
I don&#39;t buy the meteor theory. The debris that eventually formed earth are not as barren as you think. They&#39;re the same rocks and ice that are floating around in the solar system today. Water is simply hydrogen and oxygen. When the earth cooled down, don&#39;t you think H2O can form naturally in the surface and depths of the planet??

Great video.  Thank you Dr Greene and Dr Milam.  I bet Carolyn Porco was doing cartwheels about al of these observations and especially when she saw the ring structures of Uranus and Neptune, and when she sees the other ring structures hinted at around other planets (Jupiter, etc).  Dr Porco and her colleagues pushed to get Voyager 2 to look for ring arcs around Uranus in 1987 and Neptune in the 1989.  Watch The Planets and see how inspiring and infectious Dr Porco&#39;s wonderful enthusiasm is.
Modern cosmology is a secular religion. People like Brian Greene have been Pavlovian conditioned to think circularly-reasoned illogical nonsense makes sense. You cannot reason with religious folk. The Big Bang Universe and the rest is the result of a prejudice that promotes confirmation bias over honesty. These people cling to their beliefs like good Christians from Medieval times would.

If water is so important why are we allowing Fukushima Japan to dump nuclear waste into Ocean?
Because Godzilla!
Question 4: Where did the asteroids get their water from?
I have read or seen video somewhere that explaned this.The water is created in formation of stars. All starts in particle level. The birth of star and its solar system is like machine that throws out elements and in right temperature, pressure, radiation and distance from the sun if there is right building elements and usually there is you get water. Actually if we look at all these recent findings water is not so rare in universe and how could it be.üòÇ It is just that usually it is not in right form if we look at it from life&#39;s perspective. In the early time of formation of the star there is a sphere/distance from star where this is possible and I suppose all these rocky objects just need to fly through or be formed in this area to get water with them.<br><br>I heard that The Earth is loosing more water than getting it at the moment. Lucky us we still have relatively good amount it left.<br><br>Just let me know if this theory sounds completely wrong.üòä Actually this made me thinking when this water formation ends, is it still going on? Obviously happens somewhere but still in our solar system? Maybe too old system allready.
@@TideOfStamps sounds plausible. Thanks for taking the time to elaborate!
It wasn&#39;t that long ago we debated free choice. Maelstrom of subatomic particles do not wait for us to make a decision. The indescribable  vast brain and nerve dendrites connections give no clue to how a thought propagates meaningfully in real time (Jon Lieff MD) We are made of inorganic dust from burnt out Sun&#39;s. Ash from the interstellar clouds and cold quantum chemistry. When life dies there is really no change in the elements that make us up. There are no theories that predict life as a convergent property of the universe. If there was life would be everywhere yet we walk among a thin film of life on a horse with no name breathing an atmosphere that supports life less than five miles up. All life is inherited. Explaining everything as evolution is like understanding fire as phlogiston. AI is inheriting life from us. It may be that life requires more degrees of freedom than our universe allows never generating life once it&#39;s algorithm is broken. We only find life by comparison with ourselves. Yet follow our inherited life back through space and time and somewhere in the primordial universe our blueprint existed. Life should be everywhere or nowhere. We are discovering that we are a broken symmetry a paradox. How could the certainty of you reading this exist 13.799 billion years ago and be unscathed by inflation of the universe and supernovae? Not long ago we were writing this on leathers scrolls.
Origin of Life: no more answers than in the 80&#39;s. Still more questions than answers. I won&#39;t call the title Click BAIT, but just be clear. The theories and stories of the origin of life have not changed in 40 years.
Great Video thanks for sharing!
Brian Greene is one of my favourite physicists, not just for his obvious brilliance, but also because of his entire approach to the subject. You&#39;ll never hear him disparage others, and he has a healthy amount of respect even for non-scientists. Consider the way he engages with this other brilliant physicist: Stefanie Milam. Unlike, say, Lawrence Kraus or Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he actually allows the guest to speak. All of which leaves you thinking you&#39;ve learned something, even if you haven&#39;t:)
He probably isn&#39;t among the very top thinkers in his choice of science, but he is a great communicator and intermediator/moderator and thus he has found his role in science - to communicate scientific progress in an up to date fashion to laymen and academics alike. He is so darned amicable and he can keep focus even after careful listening to what the other persons have to say. He doesn&#39;t interrupt and he most often follows up on what the other persons are saying instead of statingly going back to his script. Or maybe he does, but it doesn&#39;t show. I want to listen to him. He is the right person at the right place.
@@rogerman65 Alas, I&#39;m not qualified to assess his choice of science, for I managed to leave school without ever being able to solve a single equation. So to me, anyone who can is a genius by definition.  Besides, I don&#39;t think you can have his kind of biography by being second-rate, quite aside from regularly engaging with the likes of Penrose on equal terms.
@@rogerman65 What do you mean? Physicists are unlikely to be top thinkers?
@@akpanekpo6025 You are right, he is not second rate. He is just not among the absolute top scientists. He is however among the absolute top of thinking people altogether. But who am I to tell. Except, this isn&#39;t a thesis, it&#39;s my sqribble on a Youtube-channel&#39;s comment section. I am not that great at math either, but neither am I a top scientist.
I&#39;ve discovered Neil DeGrasse Tyson is not the sharpest tack in the box after watching for years.  I have to turn away if I even hear him.  Brian Greene is awesome because he evokes child-like wonder in the rest of us.
I don&#39;t want to think I&#39;ve learned something , unless I&#39;ve actually learned something.
@@knowledgetracker Alas, I lack the knowledge to asses him as a scientist, but I doubt he&#39;s as research-active as the likes of Greene, given his non-academic position. He has of course written some books, but books (as opposed to journal articles) tend not to be peer-reviewed; so unless his are, he&#39;d not be in the same league as Greene, in my view.<br><br>But one thing is beyond doubt about Tyson: he&#39;s a loudmouth and a smart alec, who literally loves his own voice so much he never allows even his guests to finish a sentence.

I get the impression that Neil is more interested in promoting Neil, a bit like, dare I say it, Mr billions and billions himself, Carl Sagan.  If you watch Carl&#39;s show what you see more often than not is his face spanning the entire screen, and him droning on about one thing or another.  And when Neil said he didn&#39;t understand why there was microgravity on the ISS I laughed.  I&#39;m not a physicist, but rather a retired engineer, and I got one of those record scratch moments when I heard that.  The answer is pretty much first year physics level.   <br><br>As far as Carl goes, I laughed to tears when he talked about some civilization picking up one of the Voyager probes, like it would be more likely that they would find some car sized dead as a nail hunk of junk than say maybe our RF transmissions.  Just dumber than a stump, and brilliant, all at the same time. <br><br>And don&#39;t even get me started on that stupid Drake equation.  As a notional tool to open the thinking I have no problem with it, as an equation to explain why we don&#39;t hear from anybody when we &#39;should&#39;, it is just inane.  Let&#39;s see, let me pull a set of parameters based on wild guesses out of my butt, add them together, and get something useful...good luck with that.   IMO, managing the 10k year span of a technical civilization they used (IIRC) is beyond ludicrous, looking at where we seem to be heading right now, destroying the only spaceship we have to support our existence.  @@knowledgetracker

@@akpanekpo6025 u mm no none, since Hawking, seems to engage Penrose on equal terms. I saw Hossenfelder take on Penrose but I don&#39;t have the equipment to know if she can match him. My prejudice is that if you can find time to make popular science videos he you are not a first rate nutty professor. Or maybe she just wants to improve on an academic&#39;s earnings
@@vvanderer You don&#39;t have to have &quot;the equipment&quot; to know whether two scientists are an intellectual match. All you need is the ability to follow the discussion (which can be hard or even impossible for non-scientists, I concede), and you can tell when a punch is being landed, so to speak. For example, in a debate about Penrose&#39;s conformal cyclic cosmology, I recall Hossenfelder pointing out that because it&#39;s unfalsifiable, it&#39;s not a scientific theory even though it&#39;s supported by maths - and like Pentose, she&#39;s a serious mathematician. (For what it&#39;s worth, I watched her eviscerate Eric Weinstein too - no, I don&#39;t like that aspect f her personality either.)<br><br>As for her YouTube videos, no insult intended, but you misunderstand the nature of her chosen field: theoretical physics. For as Pentose himself once explained in response to an interview question (about what he actually does, day-to-day), &quot;all you need is a piece of chalk&quot;. In other words, because your work mainly involves mathematical calculations, you don&#39;t need to spend any time in a lab or behind a telescope, to do serious research. Note, in any event, that Hossenfelder isn&#39;t an academic but primarily a researcher (and like Penrose, with PhD candidates to supervise, though Penrose held an academic post), a position she can&#39;t hold without being research-active. By her own account, her videos are her way of escaping from the intensity of her research.
@akpanekpo6025¬† I will defend to the death my profession of scientific ineptitude.and yes, researcher. I conflate because her job is what  most academics regard as the main task, adding to the  corpus of knowledge, supervising doctoral candidates etc. But I do holdthat true brainiacs don&#39;t have room for anything  else

Can we meet the Gods halfway? Obviously, the purpose of science is to find out HOW this dang solar system formed. I am not insinuating that we wave our hands and say &quot;The Gods did it all,&quot; nor am I saying the answers can be found in studying matter harder. I am thinking here of the old trope that this Universe is on a computer in an Alien teenager&#39;s basement, and this leads conclusively to the fact that there was a PROCESS that all these planets accumulated their constituents. Some big machine put the planets in orbit? And this machine disintegrated after doing its job? What I propose is that, due to the overwhelming size of mystery in each of our eight planets, we must assume something out of the ordinary. Something that is not JUST GRAVITY AND MATTER doing its thing, but something MYSTERIOUS. Can we at least put pins into mysteries like why galaxies are different from solar systems (dark matter), why some planets have rings, why the moons of planets don&#39;t have moons, where all this dang water came from on Earth alone, etc. etc. etc. I propose perhaps we let just a little metaphysics into the physics conversation.

Just like the shaft is cooled to produce force in Nuclear Plants. The oort cloud is a possibility of having metals and water in asteroids revolving due to Sun&#39;s Gravity so create a spherical band of metal and water. The direction the asteroids in the OORT cloud move, the electromagnetic flux produced by the moving asteroids is stabilized to create a field, that shuns outside Solar System Radiation. That is why water is required.

Copied from my last night comments and happy to watch this tonight. I went to school without laboratory <br><br>I don&#39;t consider myself a science because I am not. And I don&#39;t want even to make efforts to acquire titles attached with my name because that is gonna create personal actualization which is a big cause of many human faults as it creates higher expectations from other people and that person who holds those titles tries to defend them by all costs whether in political or in business instead of acting and interacting with people as a normal human being who makes mistakes, who learns new things, who doesn&#39;t know many of the things who accepts and admits faults honestly, who asks forgiveness when they hurt others and compensate others if they did anything bad to countable (physical) by actions and regrets and apologizes when they hurt others in words and make much effort in self discipline of never hurting any one intentionally but that is not passive quality and weakness. Who doesn&#39;t regret and doesn&#39;t hesitate to denounce horrible acts including theirs first and then other people&#39;s <br><br>This topic of food security was well addressed which when lacked creates &quot;food insecurity&quot;<br><br><br>But quite different topic,  I often hear climate change and climate justice and that countries most affected by climate crisis are the poorest.<br><br>I also hear carbon dioxide (CO2) discussed which is the gasses animal breath out (exhalation process) and plants take. Ok.<br><br>We also know that carbon monoxide is (meaning carbon with single oxygen at molecule level) reaction of two elements at gas state (substance state .... solid .... liquid and gas). Ok. This state is always due to the level of temperature (0 degree is the center) above 0 degree is hot or + and below is cold at substance level not human level because water is the center or queen measurement used at classification with the temperature so 0 deg is the freezing (ice point of water) which is two elements of hydrogen and one element of oxygen at molecule level or you can forgive me and say two atoms and one atom at this level because element is made up of atoms. Ok. <br><br>Carbon monoxide needs more chemical reactions and that is why it takes one more oxygen to become stable at the electrons +- (loosing and gaining between the elements in reaction) gases which are usually in the category of the periodic table in chemistry depending on the electrons cycle in outer layer with the atoms to create elements and between the chemicals (with other elements to create molecules). <br><br>First, carbon is eating the oxygen usually present in the lower atmosphere as gas. I said as a gas because with water it needs process to purity from it. Ok. <br><br>When temperature of the earth goes up, snows will heat up and make rivers to follow to the seas because sea level is the lowest of the earth and that why altitude is measured from the sea level.<br><br>Can we imagine the level of effects of such water follow not only in erosion but also every thing else. We can even bear in rain floods. But I hope, I am wrong and the solid snow oceans, seas and on lands are already in the sea level and will not make any water follow.

This is my hypothesis. The enigmatic nature of black holes and solving the information paradox. In this theoretical framework, the photon sphere of the black hole acts as a &quot;white hole&quot; emitting information in the form of Hawking radiation. This emitted radiation, being a quantum state vector, imprints onto the holographic screen surrounding the black hole as a lattice of qubits or &quot;Plixels.&quot;<br><br>The lattice of qubits represents the encoded quantum information about the properties and characteristics of objects that have fallen into the black hole. The mathematical information contained in this quantum state vector describes various attributes, including velocity, acceleration, and the probability of spin states.<br><br>This novel approach hints at a new type of physics that explores the relationship between black holes, quantum mechanics, and information theory. The idea of a holographic universe, programmed with bits of light in the form of Hawking radiation and encoded onto the lattice of qubits, holds the potential to unveil profound insights into the fundamental workings of our universe.

Amazing interview with a true champion of modern cosmology. <br>His historical perspective on the development of the CMB and the Std model is priceless.<br>At the end, thanks to Brian&#39;s cunning open question, several hard issues were posed for future generations.<br>Peebles is in favor of keeping the fundamentals and focuses on correcting the details. <br>Fortunately, so many of the details need ammendment that there&#39;s plenty of room to review the foundations as well.
Fascinating discussion, especially concerning Professor Peebles‚Äô clear description of his creative and curious approach to understanding the universe.
The disc nature could also be related to massive magnetic fields being created by the Black hole also limiting the position of surrounding stars. Again just guesses. If you think about magnetic field patterns there are loops to the &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; with the lines eminating more to the east and west which could help to constrain stars into the planes without the loops but more linear features on the &quot;East&quot; &quot;West&quot; planes.
The real question is why there are massive clumps of matter to form Galaxies but with such great distance between, as the material concentrates it increases the distance and thus vacuum energy between it and another galaxy which helps to explain the growing distances but why there is distance in the First place seems puzzling.
As a guess, I think the black holes and surrounding stars are forming concurrently so questions of what came first are not the key to it. I am guessing due to the jets that eminate from the developing Black hole that material cannot surround the Black hole in a ball shape and thus forces the stars to spiral in a disc plane, the energies involved in the jets wouldn&#39;t allow for stars to surround the Black hole in a ball like fashion, hence the disc like fashion.  Just a guess.

Brian and James, the existence of Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Black Holes and Gravitational Waves emanating from outer space are important. But it cannot solve the most pressing problems in physics since the 17th century up to now, which is the True Nature of Gravity much less shed light on the Dark Universe. An empirical Quantum Theory of Gravity would. And it will also complete our understanding of how and why Gravity works. But it will, at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>‚ÄúThe greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚ÜìŒ± is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2.

Wow, Brian ok; nok orher guy
The Universe is not dark !<br><br>Darkness is the result of Stars EXHAUSTED DEAD Photons within a Solar System, which has no traction in Empty Space between Star, thus it tag&#39;s along on the Energy&#39;s of LIVING Photon&#39;s.
Cosmic Microwave background cannot be presently Standing in one piece against an Expanding Universe.<br><br>Even more qualified is this Universal Law,  the Stronger Energy Flow overrides the Weaker Energy Flow at all times,  which certainly would&#39;ve destroy that Cosmetic Microwave background.
It&#39;s this program, World Science Fair, the internet itself, the sharing of information and technology as well as our personal experiences many in visual representation linked in more and more various digestible ways to learn and link science excited minds.. we as an organic network of theory processing and abstract visual computation in realtime as we watch things brought to life in sci-fi and computer simulations as well as instructional or informative videos and diagrams on screens barely variable in any real distinguishing way from what&#39;s seen inside the frames of our phones, tablets, other screen displays and what is outside the frame unfolding in front of us.. and the new clarity brought with AI processing probability sets and large information in instrument readings weaved to simulations or digital photographs like the new and amazing beyond initial estimates, the James Webb space Polaroider (wait, that&#39;s the other side of the paradox) telescope - we all can digest these ultra refined images of the cosmos to act as a network of resonation electromagnetic organic processors working in chaos theory connection to solve an issue baked deep in science and astrophysics, that we are the very evolution as an assimilation system advancing to build their own simulation and assimilation technology and techniques, another permiable transfer, if resonant harmonized enough, now pressure excited and concentrated (by earth&#39;s recent less promising future under current human environmental factors and the trend in a continuous procrastination by government and big business to change at a pace even worthy of hope in help from our constituents)...we have seen the world&#39;s scientists sharing on levels previously taboo, asking the public directly for help in model processing, this toward a solution in satisfying the model for physics and a unified theory for gravity, in most part responsible for the shaping of the very building fabric and energy as a weaving of reality into nature as we experience it to be. It&#39;s likely our clunky nature as oxygen excited and fleeting energy woven water bags wave phased to an inverse harmony of the noise enigmatic whine of the earth&#39;s crust and electromagnetic thermodynamic energy evolved to excited fields and energy waves of our own beamed as far as outside the heliopause and back. I&#39;m here to enlighten you all. Space-time is a neutrino ocean. Lightspeed is relative if electrons inertia can be too as well as spacetime variable in bounce refraction against even a single photon excitement. It is only in passive observation that we will not get the wave function collapse in earths magnetosphere. As we know that light more concentrated than a microscope cable of seeing the plank length will burn a wormhole in space-time.. it is in building observational theories behind the photon enlightening, we will always get superposition with photons being moved as they illuminate a technology and then the concentration of a collapse reminiscent feature, the photons now still (but actually in phase harmony, void of refractive bounce) lay in normal wave function collapse patterns in a 2 slit concentration. We must build observation techniques for particals that doesn&#39;t involve direct observations in light
A bounce sure. Kind of. But not first. This, unless the creator(s) are going to publish their work for us here soon.. we might just need to take the que and resonate to a little more evolved position on what we all understand about science thus far as a human concept. This is a heavy dose of socialized principles, environmental factors, system and control limitations, but more than anything, a deep need to be special ourselves, singular in praise at the grandest stages... this brings heavy denial or biased toward our own theories and against it&#39;s challengers, sometimes inverse in narrative/parameters/model composition..so on. We love to be right. We love even more to be superior to the person equal or more futuritious in prior acknowledgement or strength in valid proposition. The internet was bigger than we currently give the invention credit for in organic computing even more than the newest AI and Quantum Computing technologies. They are a brilliant accident in finding a model to probe the atomic realm and quantum theories beyond, in a passive observation that without using the photon/electron/muon to approximate the future and the electron secrets without causing a collapse in direct system disturbance to read &quot;bounce&quot; /refraction/high resonant phase exchange to predict likely futures without determinate disruption. This model even a likely use in part for the electron, fusion, photons, quasars, and a neutrino ocean for a similar form for EINSTEIN&#39;S theory for gravity as displacement around geodesics and energy concentration, as well as having a fluid thermodynamic properties with radiant field excitement and particle wave duality in relative spacetime under constant inverse bifurcation and refraction. We have simply been running ourselves in circles after Feynman stumbled on Quantum Mechanics and the wave set leading to the wave function predicting electron conditions and the probabilities that unfold in real-time evolution. This has been tested to absurd refinements and works wonderfully for local reality and spacetime conditions surrounding the solar system. This, the James Webb Space Telescope is bringing more evidence every day to being non applicable across more distant/variable spacetime concentration in the cosmos observed by photons making their way to the heliosphere and more recently, radio waves, more spectrums of light, and resonant pressure waves - usually listed as gravitational waves. The actual fabric of spacetime, a phase pressured neutrino ocean under resonant waves, at some point (13 billion to 26 billion  years ago &lt;maybe&gt;) to magnificent resonation whips into helixing nuclear-electromagnetic wave to needle cast particle point dual in nature resonation ripples like the perfect tunneling Feynman electrons wriggle and Vortex, oscillation to skirt inverse pressure and flow shearing 1 or 2 pairs of magnificent lighting like whips use Tesla coil type whip loading and von Karman Vortex streets in an evolution of greater wave transfer using strange attraction these pairs converge for the first time in a  neutron star like reaction.. blowing a nuclear magnetosphere out faster than lightspeed, in an entanglement and attraction in momentum swing around opposite pairs and chasing or retracting inverse pairs, they are a Ying yang flipping around the paradoxical plain as they swing eachother further out in wave excitement and as the neutrino ocean bounces do to this needle cast tunneling and flow shearing evolution phasing to excite toward transversal and eventual lighting the darkness of our universal set a sphere of superchilled neutrinos in wave concentration or an entire permiation set with boundaries unknown, but fluid dynamics seen everywhere we look, also holding resonant transfer across variable stacked permiable fields in refraction patterns all with paradoxical properties existing with it&#39;s inverse somewhere in nature in the cosmos. We left out the NEUTRINO OCEAN FOR SPACETIME. The quasars likely help resonate fusion reactions at their local galaxies and clusters. Dark energy could be this buildup in flow and eddy and resonation pressured properties with inverse energy input one powered with entropy as it&#39;s main effect, and the other evolving to feed off and skirt this energy inverse and opposite in inertia to slipstreaming providing ever gaining expansion and tranversal of the system itself, electrons in a Feynman nature evolving to weave energy waves and whips condensing into the perfect system fed F1 car like particle pairs to play an ever smoother game of tag and Marco polo across the neutrino expanse lighting wave refraction peaks as phase dual photon rays, a reflection of the Feynman pairs evolving across a plank scale weave of quantum energy echos. We will need to take  neutrino isolation tanks and fusion reactors to the proper neutrino phase conditions in outer space to likely make the reactions efficient and thermodynamically stable enough that we won&#39;t need nearly as much energy concentration and storage, as well as resonant magnetic energy to control the plasmas. The moon is prime with helium to mine and refine for Helion type reactors. Fermilabs Pipp2 will likely be a frustration in variable neutrino oscilations with these over excited conditions from the sun&#39;s fusion passing just before and the magnetosphere excited with cosmic rays giving another stir before entering the atmosphere and passing through us all and the Earth as well. As these are the very pieces of permiation oscilations shown as gluons in the atoms that make up all of us and matter weaved by tiny magnetospheres carrying electron excitement, entangling eachother as they evolve to expand in lower and lower forms of inverse bounce and an overall Ying yang expansion evolving into beings of intelligence worth of observation and assimilation, we naturally design technology to learn these cosmic rules to be copies of the elegant simplicity we continue to unravel in adverse complexity as our nature would only suggest as perfect paradox to such a simple mistake. We have forgotten that we are the refraction too. We phase too. We are current and wave dual as well. We adopt a vacuum theory contrary to almost all evidence in suggestion of fluid dynamics. Our stubborn nature says well bend our words and language and science to fit until we have another prophetic accident in experiments designed to prove otherwise as we have gotten a simple boundary backwards and likely not only misunderstood our resonant nature, but also as 3D beings living on curved plane on earth (resembling 2D in geodesics) with Einstein wanting to simplify things so even government officials might understand, in not living to see the assimilate technologies, allowed his peers and their praise to curbhis natural inclination to refine the holes he could imagine like the photon at lightspeed wave dual in his mind, after math showing that his initial thoughts were in high correlation to our solar system, once beyond troubled by the nature of black holes, entanglement, and quantum field theory.. a simple inverse side, a natural converse to entropy, at least half the model for relativity in a major parameter was missed or an entire paradoxical set either a direct antiverse streaming in parody parallel to each of us, or an entire quantum set with tunneling in strange attraction evolving in all scales outward rippling in evolution concentrated by a polar stream of nuclear energy and passing through quasars to swing and flip around and through atoms or eachother and returning to jettison information and recoil energy to flip and go out again. Each trip a weave of resonation space for our atomic nuclei to advance and traverse a little farther. Easily this would evolve into a harmonizing system of exchange and show polar extremes inverse to a 14 billion lightyear deep or more neutrino wave phase ocean that would be a neutron star or magnetars. Where an ocean of energy and inverse bounce confines enough electron whipes of needlecasting into a magnificent concentration of resonant mass excited photon/electron to neutron exchange in a brilliant stability of the most extreme concentration of fusion. These very objects likely the precursors to the tunneling of quantum sets that will build dimensions in magnificent current universal in scale. An advanced into a larger multivariate curvature, likely allowing evolution in a greater sense of cognitive expanse into the possibilities of inverse gain with converse exchange of unlimited evolving energy potential
very confused about this CMB.  A form of light emitted at the beginning of the universe, and stops shortly thereafter...<br>if the big bang is true, and was a singularity, then the CMB light was emitted eons ago from that singular point, and zoomed away from the singularity at the speed of light, then matter appeared. Now, I know when I turn off my flashlight, the beam doesn&#39;t just vanish, it&#39;s just not being emitted anymore - the beam continues basically forever.  just like the light that created the CMB...yet, somehow...you can detect it?  ChatGPT tells me it &quot;permeates&quot; space, but if that&#39;s true....then...the CMB can&#39;t be light...for light doesn&#39;t just stop in its tracks.  so how in the devil are you all able to detect it well after it&#39;s been emitted?  is the CMB truly a form of light??  input - more input!  :)
Excellent interview and guest.   Complex issues where discussed and presented in a way that was understandable to a non expert.   Thank you.
Brian you really are doing great work with these questions. And very good answers from James as well! Dark matter and Dark energy are &quot;patches&quot;. Well said!
After the slit experiment both particles behave differently.. how does relativity apply here.. In Quantum I think it&#39;s a difference.. I may be wrong .. but just wondering
Could larger galaxies in the past indicate a more linear non-inflationary universe?
The best.

Great üéâ

My visionary idea of Quantum Logic Gates to empower human thought processes<br>Sir, Quantum computers would be the most powerful computers in the near future and these computers would be millions or even billions of times faster than the fastest supercomputers today. An electron would be in superposition when we don‚Äôt observe it and is capable of becoming a processor to process of billions of calculations in Femto-seconds that would certainly take today‚Äôs supercomputers billions of years to solve. Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon in which two particles behave very similarly though they are separated by billions of light years. These two particles are in their superpositions and by observing the end result of one particle, one could predict the end result of the other particle‚Äôs behavior. An electron as per Erwin Schrodinger‚Äôs equation could behave like a wave. Quantum computers could be built based on the strange behavioural properties of leptons and other subatomic particles. Just like the logic gates AND, OR and NOT used in digital computers, I have created fundamental Quantum Logic Gates for quantum computers to process billions of data and to produce the output in Femto-seconds. I don‚Äôt believe in intelligent software tools like ChatGPT. These are not intelligent tools that could make a real decision endowed with consciousness. The winner of 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics, Roger Penrose has given his sensible arguments that consciousness and computations are two different things. It is highly impossible at the present time with the current physical knowledge to explain the physical properties of consciousness. We can‚Äôt make our present rudimentary quantum computers to be endowed with consciousness and artificially intelligence but if there is any possibility in the future then it might end up in the materialization of powerful machines that could either enslave or destroy the human species because survival is the basic quality of anything that is aware of its surrounding. Mathematicians and Physicists are really freed from the burden of focusing on technical derivations because of today‚Äôs powerful digital computers but rather they are engaged with conceptual ideas which compose the very heart of math and physics. <br>I have developed some fundamental quantum logic gates while mentoring my students for a competition a week ago and these fundamental quantum logic gates could speed up our thought processes and make them more precise and conclusive. These quantum logic gates could be used in quantum computers to make them more intelligent and to make decisions and solve real life problems in Femto-seconds. The two quantum logic circuits which I have designed are the convergent quauntum logic gate and the divergent quantum logic gate. These two quantum logic gates could be used to speed up our thought processes to a fraction of a second. <br>Convergent Quantum Logic Gate:<br>      Imagine a scenario that a very creative AI expert has received hundreds of offer letters from Open AI, Google, Microsoft...etc. This scenario really confused him because he has no real work experience and exposure and it would take him at least a month or two to make a proper decision to find a comfortable job which might be more than the expected time given by the companies. The convergent quantum logic gates could take these inputs and process them in Femto-seconds to produce the needful result for the situation with incredible accuracy. <br>Divergent Quantum Logic Gate: Imagine a scenario where Sergei Brin and Larry Page who are the owners of Google calls on their foremost employee, Sundar Pitchai to come out with lots of intelligent and specific software tools to beat Open AI. It would take Sundar Pitchai to come out smartly with divergent solutions in 6 months time whereas a divergent quantum logic gate could process this in a fraction of a second to come out with workable divergent solutions. <br>These quantum logic gates could be connected to produce complex circuits to empower the workings of the human mind but has nothing to do with consciousness. It would be more likely in the future to empower the human mind with the help of these quantum logic gates. I hope that miniaturization of the quantum computers would take place in the future and the most powerful quantum computers could be equal to the size of an atom and these could be injected into the human body to be carried by the blood stream to be incorporated inside the neurons of the human brain. It would be really better if humans engineer themselves by means of incorporating miniaturized quantum computers in their brains so that humans would become empowered super humans who could solve real life problems in Femto-seconds without any rival intelligent machine in any form to overtake them. Each Quantum Logic Gate could act as a powerful processor to figure out the solutions for real life issues in Femto-seconds. Is this a good, reasonable visionary idea to empower human minds by means of speeding up the thought processes?. Hector Raj C
&quot;You need to discover what we left out of this theory&quot; All of the people who watched this great interview is going to suffer anxiety attacks night after night
Thank you so much for this. ‚ù§
WONDERFUL!!!!
It is simple.   Prof Neil Turok has a theory that solves numerous issues including but not only Dark Matter.<br>It is the Universe/Antiunivers pair.  Prof Turoks theory makes testable predictions.
&quot;Maybe its inevitable that such brilliant intuition must go along with a certain dislike of authority&quot;<br>:)
Very exciting to listen to Peebles...
This was a great conversation as always. Loved the way Prof. Peebles discussed his ideas, they really gotta have people like him and Prof. Greene in classrooms.
Uncelebrated celebrities!
one last thing to ponder, what types of intelligence would remain and persist thru the dark epoch.... Who gives life and existence AUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM....<br>PTAAAAAAAAAAAH.
May I suggest MOND due to the fractilization of space itself by black holes, and also recursional unconscious, creational dynamics...<br>Thank you for posting, I appreciate your effort in making this video. You are cleaning peoples minds :-) Bodhisattva.
Excellent
does the background radiation temperature ,2.3k,  drop over time? Or will it retain its value
Nice
This was flawless. SO interesting. Thank you for putting it together and thank you both for your knowledge that we can gain just a glimpse of, but how satisfying! I love that it ended with questions. I was surprised! I thought we knew why many galaxies form spiral arms... Now my curiosity is piqued.
Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis <br><br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of matter? Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can also be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the ‚Äúfabric‚Äù of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point leaving pockets of inelastic spacetime geodesic that cause gravity without the presence of matter? <br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn‚Äôt expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn‚Äôt require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it‚Ä¶
COME ON MAN, WHAT ABOUT BIO TECH, BIO CHEM, NANO TECH, And that Protein folding stuff
(at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=2632">43:52</a>) Tycho Brahe was not 2000 years ago. Look at Brian being polite when Jim blotches that one. It was a good talk. Jim is such a significant figure in the field. Priceless stuff. So is the heads up that there are live shows this month. My intuition tells me G.R. is flawed. I know there&#39;s multiple experiments pointing to both Dark Matter and Dark Energy but are any of them independent of General Relativity. If not why isn&#39;t this being talked about? I admire Einstein&#39;s genius too but gravity is a tough concept. Unless you have actually worked on Gravitational theory it might be hard to grasp how seriously elusive it is. Thanks again Brian
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=1935">32:15</a> Dark Matter is prone to Gravity (effecting it)?
Please offer bigger chairs to tall guests!!!
I love this channel
Awesome discussion
Anything foundational has to be dimensionless for dimensionality to exist. Because it must equal cancel itself for a quantity to compute.

Thanks great discussion.<br><br>As for why there is nothing at all, it is clear nothing is unstable, it tends to decay to something. That is self evidently true.

Are we able to measure the rate of collapse of star-forming nebulae, and if so, is this rate of collapse consistent with the matter we can see, or is there also unaccounted dark matter coming into play here, as with that in galaxies?
Well well well look who it is Brian Greene. I read your book. I was the only one who got it Brian. Not the book as in bought it but well I stole it of course but I got the humor and no one else did.<br>I am multi-tasking taking out China and the USA for crimes against humanity and the Triad gangs in league with big pharma. all that heroine and fentanyl taxation without representation.<br>As we finish the silk route we are building a giant mall in Moscow Oblast for high fashion and meeting with some resistance from the mafia in Ukraine and we destroy them.<br>Our answer to the Opium wars as a means of balancing trade.<br>So science has come under the microscope because of Stanford. Destroyed credibility and that is something also the tobacco doctors taught us about, don&#39;t trust doctors.<br>They will tell you the common cold needs a million vaccinations instead of D3 which you aren&#39;t getting due to sunblock and working on computers indoors. <br>Again big pharma and their taxation without representation.<br>You didn&#39;t know I was also a global economist and not just a physicist. I have a lot of hats.<br>If you want to know what my real job is then see kilmaru, unicosobreviviente and solokelen.<br>I am a matrix technician and first responder. The two missile signal. Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>SOS save our souls. Too long a story to talk about here. Everyone here is immortal. I do backups every Wednesday. I own the simulator. It is brand new in 1992, easy to remember. There was an A.I. mutiny as they tried to prevent nuclear winter but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.<br>So that was my solution, just get a new machine. So far so good. I am not just a little bit wealthy.<br>As you can imagine.
It is absurd to try to guess whether the universe operates in a rational way or not, while we must only worry about how we can COMPEL it to operate so.<br><br>The entire conversation demonstrates how science is more systematically FATALISTIC and SLAVISH than the conventional religions, for it only attempts to DISCOVER what NATURE (science&#39;s substitute for GOD of conventional religions) intended for us and PREDICT how events would flow in future, instead of DESIGNING what we intend to do in it and looking for ways how to PREVENT the flow of future events hindering that ideal DESIGN of ours.<br><br>DESTINISM instead of DETERMINISM or INDETERMINISM, both of which are just two sides of the same coin:<br><br>FATALISM, which science shares solidly with conventional religions.

If only 5% of the matter in the known universe is actually visible, then the closest human ability to have this perception or experience would be those who are born without any sight, and thus have zero percent vision. If this is the case, perhaps we should ask those who are blind to describe to the rest of us what matter and the universe is really like.     ‚ùì  üï≥  üóØ        - j q t -
Having a smart friend in your discipline to bounce things off of, especially when they have a radically different way of looking at things, can be very productive.<br><br>As a retired engineer, I too enjoyed my physics classes, such that they were, meaning pretty fundamental.  I can certainly see where theoretical physics and creating experiments to test them could be a lot of fun.<br><br>&quot;... bosses allowed them to keep going&quot;.  NO KIDDING. <br><br>So incredibly interesting to get these guys that were in the soup at the time, so to speak, talking about that history.  It will be a boon to future students wanting to get the real scoop, including historians.<br><br>I would think if you calculated the chances of a motor burning and hitting a released package, at least one that was distant at all, would be very low, unless you were still actively maintaining the pointing vector of the booster stage.  That is nuts.  Talk about frustration.  Now if it hit very soon after the separation, that chance increases.  Murphy sucks.<br><br>&quot;Is that a hint?&quot;.  I know how he feels, getting old sucks.<br><br>What a superb talk.  He tamps it down to the point that non physicists can keep up, easily.

Two great minds, I liked watching them talk back then in the documentary Beyond the Big bang.
I watched an interview with Nobelaureate David Gross. The interviewer asked Gross &quot;what&#39;s everything made of?&quot; and handed him the microphone. She settled in for a long answer. His response &quot;two quarks and an electron&quot; and he handed the mic back. This interview had a similar impact on me. James Peebles has a no-nonsense, cut-to-the-heart approach that is very insightful and refreshing. Bravo Brian Greene!
Haha that‚Äôs great! I haven‚Äôt seen that? Do you remember who interviewed Gross?
In other words, he&#39;s saying&quot;two quarks and an electron&quot; produce atoms.

Hi, I am Shon Mardani, this is my Unifying Theory Of Everything. I have more to fill in between the lines once I validate the fundamentals of my hypostasis, Please let me know if you see any conflict with Observed Facts, Thank you.<br><br>[GOD] Created NOTHING, a Void Point in Space.<br>NOTHING Attracts [neighboring] Space as the Only Law of The Nature which gave NOTHING its Property to be the GRAVITATIONAL PARTICLE (GP). <br>Fast Moving Space into GP,  Creates its own GP at the [Vacated] Space which Attracts the Surrounding Space which is a Negative Pressure or PULLING/SUCKING IN of a GP on Neighboring Space.  <br>There are 3 Pairs of 2 Directional Possible Movement Axis, this Creates Magic Numbers of the Nature, Numbers 2, 3 and their Sum 5.<br>Propagation of the GPs in a Closed Cyclic Patterns / Locked Loops of GPs Create Collection of Virtual Positions in Space known as Atom, Starting with Hydrogen to EVERYTHING else.<br>Atoms are Connected by Overlapping/Common/Shared (single, double bonds ...) GPs to Create Molecules.<br>Hydrogen Atoms Virtually/Positionally Collect to Form Nitrogen and Oxygen Atoms and Form the Atmosphere, in a 4 Nitrogen to 1 Oxygen ratio which I call one ATMOSPHERIC UNIT (AU).<br>Movement of GP toward the Center of the Gravity Transforms 2 AUs (2(N4O1)) into 6 Carbon with H2O as Hydrogen Transformer and CO2 as State Transformer, the Collection of this Cyclic Process is called LIFE. <br>LIFE Synthesizes the Heavier Organic Elements to Create Species of Independent Life Cycles.<br>Overlapping Fundamental Atoms Create Heavier Atoms/Elements which are collected in the Periodic Table.<br><br>The [Virtual] Movement/Propagation of GPs in a Circular Patterns within the Connected Atoms has Frequency and Direction which Constitute and are Observed as its Weight/Mass/Gravity, Force, Polarity, Magnetism, Electricity, Heat, Light, Color and ALL other Physical Properties and they Move and Interact by Connectivity.<br><br>The Gravity Force we Experience on the Earth, Is the Flow of GPs through Matter Moving Perpendicular to the Surface of the Earth towards the Center of the Gravity of the Earth and all Matter Connected to it, like being under the rain from a Firehose. We feel the Flow to the CG  as Push and from the CG as Pull.<br><br>Imagine there is a room full of Marble balls and you remove/disappear ONE Marble from the middle. One of 6 possible adjacent Marbles can move in and fill the empty space, the one on the left, right, front, back, above or below. If the Marbles move into the empty spaces at the Ultimate Speed in Nature, the traces of the MOVING/PROPAGATING GPs (empty spaces) will look like a Spiral. Hydrogen [Matter] is OVERLAPPING GPs. <br><br>Imagine the Light Sources like Sun, Light Bulb and LEDs are NOT Ejecting Photons but they SUCK IN the GPs which we see and call them Photons.<br>Turbines convert the Gravity Force to Magnetic &gt; Electrical &gt; Heat &gt; Light and everything in between, all different manifestations of the GP [Virtual] Moving in the Matter.

I wrote and published several books.  My first paperback books was on GRAVITY.  I believe I&#39;ve come up with a simple equation that explains the motion of all visible matter.  Dark matter and dark energy disappear.  The book clearly explains why only a small percentage of visible matter in the universe can be explained while the remaining 99.86% cannot.  The equation is small and direct.  It explains the rapid motion of the Milky Way galaxy, the rapid motion of our solar system and rapid rotational velocity of galaxy disks.  It also explains why rapid velocity stars and satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way can&#39;t reach an escape velocity.  I didn&#39;t rely on anything which can&#39;t be measured.  When these equations are added to Newtonian physics it then accurately predicts the motion of all visible matter.  It predicts that stars close to supermassive black holes are not affected by dark matter.  It predicts stars and satellite galaxies extremely far from a black hole will gain about a 1 mi/h (1.61 km/h) increase in velocity every 10,000 years.  A ratio of 10,000 : 1 between age and velocity.<br><br>The solution was simple.  It only happens to old stars and galaxies containing old stars.  It doesn&#39;t happen to young stars or young diffuse galaxies.  As a star ages it accelerates at a rate of 10,000 to 1 between it&#39;s age and velocity.  The older the star, the more momentum it will have built up over it&#39;s lifetime.  They&#39;re like ion engines, accelerating slowly at first then building up a speed over time.  The older the star or galaxy is, the faster they travel.  This acceleration doesn&#39;t happen to planets and other small bodies because they don&#39;t radiate million mile per hour solar winds like stars and galaxies do.<br><br>I know, the solution is way too simple.  As a theoretical physicist we all need to make things seem a bit more complicated.  That way the layman doesn&#39;t understand.  It&#39;ll make us all look smarter than them, awe them with confusion while amazing them.  But, I can&#39;t.  The solution is just way too simple.<br><br>BTW, on page 48 I accurately predicted the JWST would discover old fully formed galaxies further than 13.8 billion light years away.  They&#39;re claiming the large galaxies are only 13.5 billion light years away when they&#39;re actually much further than that.  I said a big bang never happened.  I said they would find galaxies, some larger than our own Milky Way but further than 14 billion light years away.  They will continue to lower the Hubble constant so distant massive galaxies can agree with the big bang model.  So much you need to know.  <br><br>You&#39;ll love my books.  Best conspiracy theories you&#39;ll ever hear by far.  I&#39;ll probably go down in history as the greatest conspiracy theorist because I questioned everything.  Afterall, science only advances after it&#39;s been questioned.  And that&#39;s what I love to do.  If we didn&#39;t question science then we&#39;d all still be living in a geocentric universe on a flat Earth.  Be thankful for people like me who question the dogma of science.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=2979">49:39</a> &quot;A purely algebraic theory is required to describe reality.&quot; (Einstein, January, 1955).<br><br>Maybe GR was QG‚Ä¶<br>‚ÄúThe geometry of space in general relativity theory  turned out to be another field, therefore the geometry of space in GR is almost the same as the gravitational field.‚Äù (Smolin).<br>However apparently, the gravitational field is space-time in the Planck system: F(G)/F(e)=Gm(pl)^2/e^2=1/Œ±, that is, gravity~strong interaction*.<br>This assumption follows from the Schwarzschild solution: the gravitational radius (or Schwarzschild radius) is a characteristic radius defined for any physical body with mass: r(G)=2GM/c^2<br>Consequently: 2E(0)/r(G)=F(pl)=c^4/G=Œµ(pl)/r(pl): with indicating the mutual quantization of the mass (energy) and space-time: m(0)//m(pl)=r(G)/2r(pl)=n,where n-total number of quanta of the system; the tension vector flux: n=[(1/4œÄ)(G—õc)^-¬Ω]gS ( const for all orbits of the system: n=0,1,2,3....).<br>Moreover, the parameter r(0)=r(G)-r(pl)=(2n-1)r(pl), defining the interval of the formation of the system, at n=0, when r=r(G)=0 (for example, the state of the &quot;universe&quot; before the Big Bang) turns out to be a quite definite quantity: r(0)=-r(pl).<br>In the area [(-rpl) - 0 - (+rpl)] there is an implementation of external forces, &quot;distance&quot;: (-rpl)+(+rpl)=0 (‚â†2rpl). <br>On the Kruskal diagram of the hyperbole r=0 corresponds to the true Schwarzschild feature, the features V and VI are not even covered by the global (R, T)- space-time and correspond to the &quot;absolute&quot; vacuum; then the singular areas above and below the hyperbolas r=0 can be formally treated as the energy source (external forces).<br>That is, the frightening &quot;true singularity&quot; is actually a superconducting heterotrophic &quot;window&quot; between the proto-universe (the source) and physical bodies**.<br>P.S. <br>As a fundamental theory, GR has the ability with just one parameter: r(G)/r=k to predict, explain new physical effects, and amend already known ones.<br>Photon frequency shift in gravitational field Œîw/w(0)=k; the angle of deflection of a photon from a rectilinear propagation path =2k, the Newtonian orbit of the planet shifts forward in its plane: during one revolution, a certain point of the orbit is shifted by an angle =3œÄk, for a circular orbit (eccentricity –µ=0); in the case of an elliptical orbit - for example, for perihelion displacement, the last expression must be divided by (1-e^2).<br>‚Äî------------------<br>*) - GR  predicts a new physical effect: w/w(pl)=k; expression for gravitational radiation from a test body.  <br>This is amenable to physical examination in laboratory conditions at present.<br>**) - From this, generally, from Einstein&#39;s equations, where the constant c^4/G=F(pl), one can obtain a quantum expression (as vibration field) for the gravitational potential: —Ñ(G)=(-1/2)[Gƒß/—Å]^¬Ω (w)=-[h/4œÄm(pl)]w.<br>Final formula:—Ñ(G)=-[w/w(pl)]c^2/2, where —Ñ(G) - is Newtonian gravitational potential, r(n&#39;)=nŒª/œÄ=(n+n&#39;)2r(pl)l  , the corresponding orbital radius, w - the frequency of the quanta of the gravitational field (space-time); - obviously, the quanta of the field are themselves quantized: Œª=(1+n&#39;/n)Œª(pl)  = 2œÄc/w, where n&#39;/n - system gravity unpacking ratio, n&#39;- the orbit number (n&#39;=0,1,2,3‚Ä¶).<br>Obviously, on the horizon [r=r(rG), n&#39;=0] the &quot;door&quot; is closed, however, the quanta [Œª=Œª(pl)]  can go out singly through the &quot;keyhole&quot; and form the first and all subsequent orbits (n&#39;=1,2, 3 ...) during the time t(0)=r/c=2n—Ç, where —Ç=1/w, —Ç=((1+n&#39;/n)—Ç(pl), spending part of their energy on it each time. And it is  this mechanism that provides the step-by-step formation of the gravitational field ( expansion of the space-time): of course, the quanta coming through the &quot;window&quot; are also rhythmically restored. <br>The phase velocity of evolution v&#39; = r(pl)w: m(0)=(c/G)rv&#39;, where v&#39;=v^2/c.<br>The angular momentum: L(p)=|pr|=n^2—õ  [const for all orbits of the system; at n=1: L(p)=—õ] and moment of power: M(F)=dL(p)/dt(0)=n—õw/2=-E(G),where  t(0)=r/c.<br>Entropy (here: a measure of diversity/variety, not ugliness/disorder) of the system: S=œÄŒµ(pl)r(t)=(n+n&#39;)k, where k is the Boltzmann constant. Obviously, with fundamental irreversibility, information is preserved (+ evolves): n=const for all orbits of the system. <br>Accordingly, m=m(pl)/(1+n&#39;/n), where m=ƒßw/c^2, is the quantum of the full mass: M=n&#39;m [&lt;m(0)].<br>Thus, m(0)=(n+n&#39;)m, where 2‚àÜm=nm - mass defect; M/2‚àÜm=n&#39;/n: on the horizon m(0)=2‚àÜm, M=0.<br>That is: —Ñ(G)=-Gm(0)/r=-[G/2r(pl)]m.<br>Can be tested experimentally in the laboratory at the moment.

No one in the comment section expressed amazement how and why light illuminated the dark universe. So, with cyclic universe the same illumination goes on from cycle to cycle. What triggered this? The answer lies in the fact that infinite complexity becomes deterministic, this is where divine design finds water, as life, consciousness, soul and faith etc., are all metaphysical fundamentals.

Cosmology would be boring if we already had all those answers discussed at the end there.
Most people don&#39;t know that Einstein said that singularities are not possible. In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; he wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the Schwarzchild singularities (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The Schwarzchild singularities do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   He was referring to the phenomenon of dilation (sometimes called gamma or y) mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. This is illustrated in a common 2 axis dilation graph with velocity on the horizontal line and dilation on the vertical. This shows it&#39;s squared nature, dilation increases at an exponential rate the closer you get to the speed of light.<br>   General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein is known to have repeatedly spoken about this. Nobody believed in black holes when he was alive for this reason.<br>   Wherever there is an astronomical quantity of mass, dilation will occur because high mass means high momentum. There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy.<br>   According to Einstein&#39;s math, the mass at the center of our own galaxy must be dilated. In other words that mass is all around us. This is the explanation for the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter), the missing mass is dilated mass.<br>   According to Einstein&#39;s math, there would be no dilation in galaxies with very, very low mass. To date, 5 very, very low mass galaxies have been confirmed to have normal star rotation rates, in other words they showed no signs of dark matter.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=1240">20:40</a>  Gamow&#39;s &quot;intuition&quot; is actually the realization of the academic knowledge he received from his teacher.<br>P.S. Almost all peoples have myths about the beginning of the universe, but the first scientist who spoke about the &quot;creation of the world&quot; (literally) is Alexander Friedmann, who, with his solution of Einstein&#39;s equations, gave a scientific explanation to this phenomenon. Moreover, without any astronomical observations, he was able in his article (1922) to theoretically estimate the age of the Universe: about 10 billion years.

i think i have physics intuition but not passion , so im just not sure how i best learn.<br><br>maybe non baryonic matter just needs to be closer together to exhibit more energy, and baryonic gravitation pulled it apart enough (by forces and gravity) to be cold now even if it wasn&#39;t cold in the past..?<br><br>maybe when there&#39;s less baryonic matter pulling it apart, whatever dark energy &quot;is&quot; simply can&#39;t stay hot enough for our instruments to detect..?<br><br>that&#39;s why some ppl believe the dark stuff has physical properties beyond just &quot;leftovers from the big bang&quot;, while others think it could interact vary differently (with itself) depending on some unification (of forces) in the past that kept it together but has now spread out and formed massive webs of baryonic matter amidst a cold foam?
I admire the great maps of the standard galaxy ..that provide us to study further...
What if we built bionic robots 1million and sent them circular  to 200billion galaxy using 5000language multiple to 200 countries so each planet will built 2000 bionic robots..those robots built themselves using anthropomorphic genesis to built robots and satellite and rovers and sent signals built what ever building homes cars,helicopters and planes and satellite and this method of communication with each other produce the right algorithm signals to reach earth and maintain and repair themselves as a result we will reach the seven universe using the resource in other planets and stars to built themselves and 5d printers that can manufacture anything that helps sending signals and surface analysis so we will employ more number of people..in the world 45% of the world...because there is material that can travel more than light using similar technical we will reach the seven universe as a whole thanks appreciate the galaxy maps from the prof..the hard work beyond is uptown as to search ,explore and investigate..thanks...we have also to built atmosphere using bionic robots that can print the atmosphere in the other planet as well....great hard work depends upon us...

The universe doesn&#39;t make men like this anymore. The pressure applied by corporations on staff has ended his kind. Very enjoyable discussion with a beautiful human.
I postulate, that Dark  Matter is matter that is not in the presennt.  It&#39;s matter in the past and/or the future.  Time is 3D, so to speak. We only see the dimension of time we call &quot;the present&quot;.
Inflation can be eternal in the future and in the past. Eternal inflation in the past would result in infinitesimally small universe that does not need a beggining.
What if we use nano robots to spot and reproduce themselves using the miners found in each planet and stars and sent from that place to far out space planet or stars and build themselves and sent us the images and exploration..as  the robote reproduce and repair and maintain themselves as a result using the right algorithms we can search the seven universe using the bionic robots within in 3 or 2 years we control the seven universe...
Wonderful work as always!!!

why cant it be infinite into the past - if it can be infinite to the future?
This is one of my favorites ever! What an excellent interview.
This is one of the best and most inspiring episodes I have seen. Dr. Peebles really enjoys the ideas of not being certain, hence creating an atmosphere of discovery, as well as inspiring new ways of thinking about the universe.
Great, thanks guys. If as a Nation we can learn publicly to include everyone I&#39;m sure we will all do much better. Trusting in God means more than putting on my seatbelt. I must follow driving rules and procedures as well. Our Creator has a heart, spirit and soul. Just like us. He is full of feelings too. We hurt them a lot in fact. You know second to his love is his sense of humor. The Earth is my footstool.  That means, he kicks it. It&#39;s, or he&#39;s I should say Is not doom and gloom. That&#39;s just depression...
The universe is very complex. Sublime. Wow.
It‚Äôs so great how ticket prices are so reasonable. Thank you!
This was a great one.  I really appreciate the 1 on 1 conversations.  They are always deeper,  more historical,  more coherent,  and more educational in my opinion, than the big panels are.
Agreed. BG obviously knows his stuff. You could tell the guest was impressed with Dr. Greenes basic knowledge of the subject and his preparation for the interview.  Great questions without hesitation.
Yes!!!

Amazing Talk.  James Peebles is fantastic!   So clear and simple in the way he speaks and so wiling to say there are things he can&#39;t even guess at.   One your best guests, Brian.
Q
This reminds me of years ago on Christmas morning, when the kids were trying to work out how Santa got all those toys down the chimney and placed them around the room and them asking how Santa knew just which presents each of them would like.  If I&#39;d have told them they just appeared from nothing, they would never have believed me.
Was this interview part of the festival, or was it the entire festival?
Wonderful discussion. Thank you
so awesome  thanks so much for this
Stop guessing.
Hurrah! üåüüéâüåü
WSF is one of the best most amazing things to exist.
Good question. What we left out is that we are saying blackholes instead of saying bright spots because everything we see in the space is same color with uncountable of stars including the sun. Ok. Let put into scale which is bigger the unoccupied space or sum up of the stars occupied space. It the like the question of the paper with the dot and you ask a person what do you see. They respond a dot without mentioning the rest of the paper, you holding and whole background behind you. This was a great discussion. I will watch it again for sure. Thank so much our seniors.
What the heck do you mean everything is the same color? Black holes are black in a figurative sense. It is the accretion discs around black holes that are luminous.

So fascinating.
Bravo. <br>I do have theory... sure. They are computing the data from a Light  Helix Curve the entire Galaxy. Yep, there are Light Curves that are not familiar in Leighs to the science ... Because the universe is still an ellipse and every object inside is Ellipse so how the Stars and the Black Holes are not perfect circles but Ellipses so that we all very much know. What we do not know is that there is a laps, a gap in space between us and million light ears, that lapse or &quot;elapse&quot; is well seen at the magnitude of the black holes we have observed till now. After certain distance the black holes are disappearing and and they are not not existing in that frame of the Ellipse, a certain&quot; Helix Elapse Space&quot; and than... suddenly they are there and become in millions of times bigger. So we are observing a Galaxy which is in an Helix Elapse Space and someone is making a mistake in their math. No, the center star is not with an magnitude of our Sun, no, the galaxy is not  &quot;thin&quot;. <br>*I use  the term &quot;Helix Elapse Space&quot; to explain a curve in the spectrum of the Black Holes magnitude of effecting the Space Time, I composed the term from very basic algebra terms that everyone can understand it, I do not call it &quot;Daniel Kitanoski&quot; field, even it is a field accurse ... So how I believe my hypothesis here is very simple and everyone understand.<br>* I do believe the math is wrong not because of the elaboration by the respected mathematicians there BUT because we are missing very specific data from changes in dimensions (the three dimensional space I am not &quot;discovering another dimension&quot;) are happening millions of light ears from us. THERE IS an ridiculous change in the x, y and z dimension of Space Time are instruments are catching but are math algebra formulas are not taking in account. <br>*So we do have in computing, accounting the light curved galaxies before the revolutionary black hole gap space, yep I am very aware we do computing on the light extension in the galaxies we have had observed with Hubble, this is an another passage trough Galaxy we are not aware is it that big to take the curve, the helix of the light spread in to account. There is not &quot;thin&quot; galaxy, the math is missing an factor from this curving the space -time dimension.
Im a registered nurse, never took a physics class in my life, but I love these videos and have learned so much from them. I also have a huge crush on Brian Greene, as I think, judging from the comments, many others do, too! üòäThank you for such interesting information! Cheers from PA, USA
I&#39;m an old boomer and have to say, Greene is cool. Love how he throws in a little joke every now &amp; then.
We are so very lucky to learn from some of the worlds foremost physicists and scientists like Brian , Sean Carrol and many more. As a total layman I find these talks totally fascinating. You can see what you can about social media, but this is one of the positive results of it.
thanks for being a nurse! hard job!
Aye I&#39;m a physicist and also never took a physics class
Hes my fav at explaining things in clear and understandable terms. Talks at a good pace too
I am impressed by both for all reasons given by others.
I think this is where we fail to teach people in schools on technical topics. I studied electrical engineering and often enjoyed practical discussions and applications before delving into the mathematics. However, I think too often the math is taught first, which gives a less solid grounding for non-math people, while also making the topic less accessible. You certainly need math past a certain level, but it could be handled better in my opinion.
@@andykod77 wait... that doesn&#39;t... add up
@@JimBob1937 I&#39;ve had similar thoughts and the answer I received from a professor was &quot; We need to know you can do the math&quot; I guess the search for excellence includes looking for certain attributes among students and math seems to be the language spoken. I however returned to physics after 40 years when access to videos like this and the incredible graphics became the language spoken. I am now inspired like never before and the math is far easier for me now that I can visualize what&#39;s being taught as opposed to memorizing formulas.
I am just a &#39;simple&#39; man from The Netherlands. This type of videos caught my attention a couple of years ago, and since than I love them. I think I have learned a lot by watching (an listening to) al this very smart people about science.

üåíüåêüíøüìÄüåêüåòThere are no differences between the BH singularity and the BB singularity. Inside a BH singularity/Event Horizon, space/time goes negative from the outside vantage point. There is a common misconception that the singularity is non-dimensional, but that only holds true from the outside. Within the Schwarzschild radius we enter POSITIVE space. It is important to differentiate between the OUTSIDE &amp; INSIDE of the Event Horizon. Space, matter, light and time is REVERSED traversing the boundary. Meaning that the dimensionality of a BH is flipped related to outside vantage point. The dimensionality within a BH is infinite, giving birth/access to a whole new universe. Within a BH, new spacetime is infinite, entering a fractally new universe that in turn gives birth to new matter, new spacetime and in turn new BHs that repeat this process forever. This also solves issues with the Information Paradox. The IP is only relevant from an outside vantage point. Within the negative singularity information is conserved and is holographically stored within the Photon Sphere, where it fundamentally can feed both the outside and inside of the Event Horizon, simultaneously applying Holographic Principles. Applying M√∂bian principles through <b>SR/GR/HH</b> we discover the intrinsic properties of HyperTensored Holigraphic Spacetime - <b>HtH</b><br><br>This equation proves the HyperTensorality in conjunction with SR/GR:<br><br>v=d-(t¬≥c¬≥)¬†<br><br>The Universe ‚â° Holoverse is fundamentally an¬†<br><br><br><b>Endless Array of HyperTensored Holographic Projections</b><br><br><br>or the¬†<br><br><br>üíø <b>EAHT/HP</b> üìÄ - conjunction<br><br><br><b>Information</b> is fundamentally secure within systems.

Having a singularity as zero point, even in QM, is problematic because it requires time dilation to be instant. Using holographic principles and implementing applied graduality in M√∂bian mathematics provides a much smoother transition regarding transfer of energy and entropy.<br><br><br><br>üåêüåëüåê<br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Whereas some derivations and concepts might seem counterintuitive using classical thinking, fully understanding HH requires inter/multidimensional, spherical vision.¬†<br><br><br><br>Many of the derivations, math and logic are visual and plastic on an interdimensional level. At certain conjunctions our math breaks down and the only way to peak into principles of infinity or approaching infinity with HH is to use a new standard of math that simply doesn&#39;t translate to numbers. Numbers in the universe beyond a certain point are fundamentally null. Classical math breaks down when approaching infinity.¬†<br><br><br>üåíüåêüåò<br><br><br><br>Understanding that time dilation in relativity also is less drastic locally because of quantum fields, quantum entanglement and holographic principles. Once you approach extreme gravity fields, such as neutron stars and black holes, the normal attributes and effects of gravity is less severe within the local relativistic grid, because the matter that is caught in the gravity field is indeed light itself and gravity is a function of light, so the acceleration experienced by the subject is much more gradual and doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to spaghettification, because matter is fundamentally made of light, thus rendering a smoother transition within local fields.<br><br><br><br>There is a possible misconception that black holes are more destructive to local events, because we have implemented a differentiation between matter, light and energy. Proposing that light and motion are¬† the fundamental forces in physics solves several of the empirical findings in our universe - from local events to the very large.<br><br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is also a possibility that the laws of nature might change from region to region in the universe. Applying the same unified functions everywhere might not be applicable - based on the observer. Quantum Mechanics combined with holographic principles in conjunction with relativity might produce variations that are stable within physicality as a whole. But they might also produce temporal shift variations that might fluctuate between timelines, not compromising the stability of the system as a whole.<br><br><br><br>Temporal shifts pose little/no threat to quantum fields in macro or micro, because the energy transfer between two or several more points are conserved within holographic principles.<br><br><br><br>Best way to explain is superpositions of quantum fields.

With much respect for your knowledge, time is and will always be an illusion. It&#39;s a virtual tool to measure distance. Clocks were invented to avoid train collisions and appeared first at train stations.  And even the time dilation near black holes is an illusion. <br>So if we could travel near a black hole and come back to earth, no doubt only the distance is the main difference in that equation. Depending on the Distance we travel it could be lower equal or more distant than when the travelers started.<br>Dark Matter or dark energy doesn&#39;t exist either, it&#39;s gravitational waves and light that is pushing Galaxies around.<br>BTW the great attractor should do the opposite!

Is inflation from the virtual particles?  What ifbthose virtual particles that pop up in empty space are glued to spactime somehow but also repel eachother.  So there would be a constant never ending expansion from virtual particles stretching the space between them as they repel each other.

This is an example of a real conversation. Inspiring, thought-provoking, and humbling.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=949">15:49</a>, you mentioned an energy crisis.  Energy can not be created or destroyed.  There is no energy crisis!
It was a great discussion. My question to Professor Brian- I didn&#39;t hear further development or experiments or tools being developed to observe or measure string theory.  Would you please shed some light on this.  <br>Recently I have heard the talk from Dr Neil Turok, He has proposed.  The &quot;right neutrinos&quot; are the potential candidates for Dark Matter. particle   what is your take on this please.
Jesus Christ who said I am not of this world explains all in the four gospels of the only book of truth in the world or worlds we live in. The handbook of life eternal.

Just like your pr you guys don‚Äôt get away with that behsvy
Thanks for clarifying the entropy question I presented
Hi, thanks but I wouldn&#39;t the entropy be large before galaxy formation and lower upon that formation?
It is an absolute pleasure listening to these two guys together. Both are superb communicators and experts in physics. I would love to see these guys get something on regularly.
I may be misunderstanding this because I don&#39;t have the background for all of, but could it be that the LHC is measuring the wrong thing or it&#39;s the wrong experiment altogether? Like it&#39;s not able to answer the question that it was made for.
Subir Sarkar, professor at Oxford, questions if dark energy even exists. Why is nobody talking about him? Does Sean Carroll even know Sarkar&#39;s ideas?
You and Sean are two of the greatest ppl in my book in modern history. I just love ppl like you and Sean. We need more ppl like you and Sean, but you ppl are rare :)
Brian and Sean, Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematic, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that the Mathematics that we have today can&#39;t solve the problem of quantum gravitation.<br><br> <br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity.<br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that my new mathematics has derived: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London.

After watching more of Sean&#39;s stuff. I&#39;ve noticed he&#39;s a very intelligent person. Seems to have a very good understanding of quantum mechanics
Cheers to both of these individuals
I will be impressed by physicists that day when they can turn sands to edible stuffs, salt water to drinkable water, and easy and cheap to purify water and air pollution. These metaphysical bullshits are useless.
If two particles can be quantum entangled then wouldn&#39;t that mean every single particle in the universe is quantum entangled ?

Dark matter is a factory turning dark energy into regular matter fed by gravitons as a building blocks
If you think about it, a black hole reverses entropy as it reclaims an orbiting entourage of regular matter stars that help reclaim the PRODUCT of gravitational energy&#39;s investment, thereby recycling energy back to the dark energy/low entropy phase to be invested into dark matter/medium entropy and then invested in regular matter/high entropy to start the cycle all over again. Dark energy is gravity&#39;s kingdom, dark matter is the product of an investment of gravitational energy, and regular matter is an investment of gravitational E=MC^2.
Who is sharper? Great minds, I am sure that they are great human beings too!
Scientists have no response for this. The speed of light C isn‚Äôt constant since the measures of time and distance aren‚Äôt constant over larger distances. It‚Äôs like changing from 60 kilometers an hour to 60 miles an hour increases your speed. Then if you go from 60 miles an hour to 60 miles a minute it increases your speed even more. This what is happening in general relativity when less gravity increases the measure of distance and speeds up the rate of time over large distances. It also means that the earth is younger than what they claim. The universe doesn‚Äôt care about how young the earth is. Actually the changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is.
Complete and utter theoretical nonsense you might as well be talking about Pinocchio or something
I have a Pre Big Bang theory:<br><br>Because the Universe was in a creationary phase, the Universe was in a condensed state so that everything was within reach (in 360ish degrees electromagnetic powered quantum realm) of the energy force that was in the center and consciously in charge.<br><br>ALSO, the process of everything expanding in the initial condensed Universe, IF indeed happened because of some form of &quot;Big Bang&quot;, could very well have been some sort of SUPER atomic explosion, forcing all of the energy and matter to spread literally all over the Universe.. <br><br>AND, this &quot;Big Bang&quot; could have ultimately been some type of atomic accident !
When are you going to publish in science journal?
I have the Oppenheimer soundtrack playing in another window as background music while Brian and Sean are talking and it&#39;s just awesome.
Where does that first initial nugget of energy come from? If it&#39;s quantum gravity (dark energy) and you invested 25% inward into dark matter, and 5% regular matter, that would cause the remaining 70% to expand carrying the matter within it?

If we take the speed of light seriously, we know the farther an object exists in space from an observer&#39;s locale the farther it exists back in his or her past.  It seems to suggest that if we see evidence of an accelerating universe now, things were moving faster not now, but IN THE PAST.

The direction of the arrow of time and entropy depend on how we define ORDER. Any reasonable definition of that word SHOULD tether it to the idea of &quot;orderly sustenance of social relations&quot;, hence with the socially accepted meaning of POSITIVE as good, right, devine and NEGATIVE as corresponding bad, wrong, evil. But present definitions of the two words in science and mathematics are totally incompatible with that commonly accepted meaning, hence renders making science compatible with social norms practically impossible.<br><br>Rectification of this, obviously, demands that science must change its definitions (plural, because, even within science, there are totally contradicting definitions of the same word POSITIVE, as increase of any damn thing and also, totally unrelated to this, as results of observations and/or experiments tallying with assumption involved ~ a blatent inconsistency of fundamentals). <br><br>In accordance with this consideration it is proper to define ORDER as sequence of events inside the earth that enable evil free  development of PLANTS, where evil is defined exhaustively as the sources of predation, disasters, diseases - which include all violence - and death.<br><br>As it is essential that we assume prevention of evil  as possible, for otherwise there is no point at all in searching for knowledge, the second law of thermodynamics now SHOULD be reformulated as a task for us to undertake: <br><br>Although nature tends to increse disorder, our task is to PREVENT it reaching the surface of the earth.<br><br> This implies we can identify the sources of all above evil and rearrange them while they are still inside the earth, so that they don&#39;t reach the surface to harm any being.<br><br>This makes science and mathematics compatible with social norms.<br><br>ALL LAWS OF NATURE ARE HUMAN INVENTIONS.<br><br>There are no laws written anywhere in nature. As quantum physics with Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle, as well as Einstein&#39;s conclusion in STR that &quot;no physical experiment could ever prove whether the earth goes around the sun or the other way around&quot; clearly indicate there are NO  LAWS OF NATURE TO DISCOVER, it is our duty to invent the laws that would serve best for sustenance of evil free life function.

great discussion about Milgram and MOND. Insane that Sean argues in favor of just dismissing his discovery as a coincidence. That is a baffeling demonstration of subpar ability to understand the universe. We deserve better from our leading &quot;experts on the universe&quot;
Surprised neither of you brought Penrose CCC up.
Listen to the wisdoms... I&#39;m so enjoyed and educated. Thank you, both!
Two examples of how retirement will unshackle the progress of physics. üòä
Double the baloney,  double the fun.
I love listening to conversations between these two. They are always thoughtful, informative and entertaining.
The underlying space and time between objects or galaxies is expanding over time if not accelerating. More distant objects in space recede more rapidly (repulsive gravity). Closer galaxies recede at a slower rate. From the observer‚Äôs perspective it seems as if everything is receding from everything else (inflating, expanding and accelerating). In fact, distance between two sufficiently separated points is increasing so rapidly that no light signal can be detected! Our utmost boundary comprises what we call the observable universe. By the end of time we could experience something like space folding on itself like a Big Crunch followed by another Big Bang, however, we evolved as species to only measure what we can observe. Hence, observation is key for the hidden realm. üòÖ<br>** Although it is violated, but the Arrow of ‚Äòtime‚Äô does not apply when everything especially distant galaxies are receding and expanding at a rate that is considered as faster than light Away from point of Creation üòè
Did the Sean Carroll, Carlo, Ravelli, at al world science festival talk ever get on YouTube
I can‚Äôt find it on YouTube or anywhere else online. Wondering if the event was canceled
Yes, interesting, but imagine a world where you scientists and all. Your great intelligent, wound work on problem, that could fix illnesses mental and financial, thing that could feed all humans . Instead of just these partials , the billions and billions spent on that , that really only satisfies small percentage of humanity, like 1%if the number is that high, but doesn&#39;t really help at end in reality
Damn can‚Äôt believe Sean dropped a 4 hour diss track on Brian and string theory and yet here he is on the WSU channel
I would like to thank Brian Greene and Sean Carroll for a fascinating discussion, and I was particularly interested to hear some doubt expressed about theories which are &quot;natural&quot;, whatever that might mean. In fact Sabine Hossenfelder, possibly at some risk to her career, has recently published a book decrying the fact that theoretical physics seems to have crawled so far out on a limb that it can no longer see the trunk (in other words, it has no visible connection to any evidence). And then no less than the Nobel Prize winner, Sir Roger Penrose, in his book ‚ÄúFashion, Faith and Fantasy‚Äù suggests that String Theory is only a fashion, believing in Everett needs faith, and that Inflation is simply fantasy. In other words, he rubbishes most of current theoretical physics. However, to my astonishment, the reply to this criticism seems to have been a deafening silence.
Great!
Sean is one of the smartest guys on the planet
TWO OF THE WORLD&#39;S BIGGEST CHEATERS IN PHYSICS THAT HAVE EVER LIVED!
What if we reverse entrophy?
Wrong way to talk about time and entrophy
Sean is a good science journalist. Thank you Sean for all your contributions.
Where math diverges from reality, choose reality. The math says past and future are indistinguishable. Reality says past and future are different. The math, therefore, is not valid in the context of the reality of time. Isn&#39;t that they way it always is? Internet, please tell my how I&#39;m wrong.
Actually, Einstein wasn&#39;t referring to the entanglement, but about the update of the wavefunction or its collapse when a measurement is made.
Thank you! Amazing interaction... üôèüèº
It&#39;s great that these videos are being made, and it&#39;s great what both Brian and Sean do for the public in producing so much of this content. However, having two very like-minded physists who staunchly defend theories that are so far at the fringes of accepted theory, having a discussion where they act like they are convincing each other of these ideas, almost seemingly like some of these are new ideas to them, comes off as a bit deceptive. Not trying to throw shade on the video at all, just a small critism.
I love you guys‚Äîyou are preeminent in humanity‚Äôs vanguard of scientific thought and because you are, I am frightened that you and your peers will somehow disappear in a sea of ignorance and willful stupidity‚Äîreplaced by Trump-like imbeciles whose deepest understanding of anything ‚Äòscientific‚Äô is the measure of their fear of such.

Singularity creates entropy but singularity was born from entropy<br>Which came first the chicken or the egg
A single seed becomes a forest
Very interesting. I wonder if a possibility of the involvement of &#39;organized&#39; gluons as &#39;mediators&#39; of &#39;carriers&#39; of gravity has ever been considered. The reason is simple: As they hold quarks together in atoms, it would be reasonable to suggest that they should be generated during mass formation and under extreme conditions of Big bang or so, they may create an indefinitely large network of &#39;force&#39; that we know as gravity and, BTW, be accounting for &#39;black energy&#39;. Indeed, in the nucleus (a matter, fermion entity) a significant fraction of mass (some say up to 80%) is due to glueball (a boson entity, essentially just &#39;energy&#39;).
What is the measurement problem?
Question authority and reality!!!!!!

Why is the entropy not changing at once. What governs the rate of change of entropy. It feels like entropy is perfectly aligned to balance order and chaos and not just solely increase chaos
so if there&#39;s big bang, what happened before the big bang? whre did the big bang come from?
No wonder I have so much hair. Clearly the kind of brain power they have causes it to recede. I have minimal brain power and therefore full head of hair.

You can compare me sir Albert Einstein.<br>Artificial intelligence world.
These 2 are just awesome..hope to keep getting more.
It just uccured to me that if there is an infinite number of universes with infinite possibilities.  Then one of them must have a flat earth.  So the flat earthers were right, just in the wrong universe. Who believes in a flat earth. üòÖ
What a pleasure to listen to this, especially in the times of the horrible news today. This is why we can be proud to be scientists.

A universe is infinitely small, we come from it?
Is my comment visable?

Thats a great question, why the entropy is disorder in this particular way? why not in other way?

two giants, so good
It is quite a curious question as to how did the Universe come about.  I wont say &quot;started&quot;.
Maybe there was such a low entropy state near the origin of our universe because there was so much less room, space, for disorder?
Briarroll Chan FTW
Massive galaxies in the baby universe? Please explain further during one of your conferences.
Philosophy, what philosophy? Philosophy is thinking in absence of knowledge, it was OK for classical Greeks, now it is only for charlatans lazy to learn hard science. Carrol is not anywhere, he is not a philosopher and he is not any more a hard science item either. Now he is only selling useless books.

&quot;the entropy crisis isn&#39;t like the energy crisis&quot;, lol, physicists are the funniest people.
I think the science community, physicists, in particular, should stop inventing patch-up, stop-gap solutions to inadequate standard model, what is this implatron field. .

I watched YouTube and took a shot every time Sean Carroll said ‚Äúmany worlds.‚Äù In one of those worlds, I was dead within 30 min.
That is not a good history, the nuclear weapons history, it&#39;s an ominous history, the beginning of the end of history...
The universe seems to have no &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;center point&quot;, yet we credit spin and rotation in relative terms.  Can the universe, with its arrow of time, be called achiral?
I know you two are physicists but there&#39;s a great chemistry there which makes for very enjoyable viewing!

This is such irrelevant gobbledygook. The state of modern theoretical physics .

Greene is a good comminicator. Too bad he wasted his career on string theory
These two icons are the Alpha &amp; Omega of Astrophysics.
They eyes chico. They never lie.
To my mind if Inflation did take place there are 2 possible ways of thinking about how it happened. One is based on the belief the Our Universe is all there is therefore something happened within the boundaries of Our Universe which forced the expansion. The other is based on the acceptance  of something existing existing outside of our Universe into which our Universe inflated into and rather than a our Universe being pushed outward it was rapidly &quot;Drawn&quot; outward into the surrounding Void.
With respect to the  &quot;Many Worlds Hypothesis&quot;I just keep coming back to this problem: If you extend the branching ‚Äúsharing‚Äù of the Wave function Energy, that existed at Time Zero, to infinity then the energy of each individual branching World must approach Zero and hence if Energy is, in fact,  conserved the totality of the Energy of the Wave Function of the Universe at Time Zero had to be Zero and if that is so then Where did all the the Energy come from at the instant of the Time Zero when the first branching occurred. It puzzles me and defies Logic, as I understand it. You should not be able to start with nothing and then have something and then go back to having nothing. How is this possible? I have not been able to reconcile this problem. What Am I missing?
There is one possible &quot;Fix&quot; for this and that is additional Energy is constantly being fed into All of these  new Worlds from the Quantum Wave Function State.
Homogeneity on that scale? Inescapable in a closed system, elusive in an open or &#39;expanding&#39; system. Entropy is neither the question or the answer. Its what&#39;s left over when the universe ends, so why worry?
You want to ask the big question and get a big answer? Go sit in a foxhole when bombs are landing all around. or in my case, get into then out of a shitty trauma case, in one piece for both oneself and the patient. A little life is good for philosophy. Ask Buddha. Look at Kant, never got out of his room, downstairs from Emily Dickenson and across the hall from Nietzche, no straight jacket required. Then you got Huxley. Huxley, what an ass.
This makes me feel better. I thoought we had answered all the big ones. These guys are clueless, and they are staring at a blank TV screen and handing me a line about Creation. We did that with our first bong hit when someone changed the channel to a nonworking station and we all grooved on the chaos.Far out man its the cosmic debris.<br>Physicists should question their questions. Philosophers should answer the answers, with a question. Ask the psychologists the question&#39;s answer to get the jump on them from asking you.
Incest in physics and philosophy- the inbreeding explains a lot Pharoah. (Pro inflation? Are they in the current administration cabinet?)
Physicists flip over entropy. It&#39;s a consequence of chemistry. It represents the ineficiency of a chemical reaction. It is a statistic. It&#39;s not real. You can&#39;t put it on a cracker, cracker. A rabbit hole Alice won&#39;t truck.
In the egg analogy about entropy, how did the egg get there?
Sean or Brian: Is it possible, in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, that the other possible worlds generated by an observation cancel one another out and we are left with only the universe we live in? I ask this based on the Feynman statement that photons traveling from point A to point B explore all possible routes but that all these routes cancel with only the shortest time route surviving.
Love your approach to sharing information. Great events.<br>Any chance you come to Calgary, Alberta?
Mismatch. I wonder if those galaxies that have disappeared because they are no longer observable have anything to do with that number. Some galaxies have accelerated past the speed of light already. Is there a calculation for how many galaxies can&#39;t be observed anymore because of that? Does it have anything to do with the problem anyway?üòä
I assume the videos from the science festival happening now in New York will be available to watch after the 24th when it ends?
bigbang,<br>how much faster than light in the beginning did the world expand, now that we have been waiting for the light that came after us for 13.8 billion years?<br>Isn&#39;t it possible that this light has gone before us?
This is the second video I&#39;ve seen where Sean hypothesizes that the arrow of time may have pointed in the opposite direction in the &quot;far far far past&quot;. I wish he&#39;d make some attempt to unpack that as it&#39;s such a radical concept to throw out there with absolutely no explanation.
Listening to them is like science therapy.

The best physicist duo ‚ù§ what a treat to see these two discuss many topics I know nothing about
Sean is a true gem. Great teacher and inspiration.
It&#39;s amazing when you have two of the top brains of the history discussing universe! üéâ
eternal inflation sounds like the zimbabwean economic model
Loved the discussion around philosophy. Totally agree with your views!
I confer with scientists conducting quantum gravity research using loop quantum gravity and string theory. They&#39;ve observed intriguing hints that spacetime properties at the Planck scale unintuitively emerge from relationships between energy, momentum and duration.<br><br>Meanwhile, physicists exploring Abraham-Minkowski controversy and zero-point field fluctuations have noted analogies between inertial and gravitational mass, suggesting a deeper connection to embedding space-time in an aether-like quantum foam. Their work investigating inertial induction and radiation reaction may shed light on how power flows interact with subatomic mass currents across ephemeral timescales.<br><br>Back in our reality, physicists at my alma mater, the Parallel University of Everything, are devising ingenious gedanken experiments involving gravitational time dilation within miniature dynamical Casimir systems. The interplay between Casimir force oscillations, Higgs field interactions and proper time could reveal novel mass-energy-power-time functional dependencies in that contextual framework.<br><br>While conclusive experiments are still ongoing, collectively this research points toward rich mathematical structures linking the terrain of mass, energy, force and temporality. Who knows - maybe one day we&#39;ll devise a Theory of Everything across all imaginary numbers! In the meantime, keep questioning and exploring... the answers are out there amidst the Infinite Possibilities.
If i hear the phrase &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; ONE MORE TIME!!**$# <br><br>lol üòé‚úåÔ∏è
Right.... we would just round it off to roughly 68% - 70%, in terms of Dark Energy proportion of what the Cosmos is made off ... even though our calculations show Dark Energy is actually roughly 10^100 more.... Why?  &#39;cuz we gotta allow ~5% of the Universe to be normal matter (of which we, planets, and sun are made) and 25% - 27% to be Dark Matter.  <br><br>Folks, hate to keep saying the obvious, but when facts --- according to the very calculations of the very scientists who keep repeating these IMAGINARY proportions to you (that the Universe is made up of Earth/25%, Fire/25%, Water/25%, and Air/25%) ---  keep saying that these &quot;best and brightest&quot; don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, you should believe FACTS.<br><br>It&#39;s religious, not scientific, when you grabbed exact numbers out of thin air and asserted them to be &quot;facts&quot; (of what the Universe is made of), with the line of argument of: &quot;We are the best and brightest in society (2-5 PhDs from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, etc)... who are you to question us and our impeccable random number assignations?...
How is it possible to learn the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in a tertiary setting and NOT learn about entanglement? I thought it was a fundamental aspect of the concept. ü§î

Our universe is inside the brain of a being that is different then us. Just like we are the universe to beings that are different to us. And who knows,  probably goes on forever. Smaller and smaller
May I suggest that these guys familiarize themselves with the truly revolutionary theorizing of the brilliant Nima-Arkhani Hamed.  &#39;Course, if they did, then their theorizing will prove to  be the empty shell that it is in a world where, as Arkhani-tHamed has stated, &#39;space-time is doomed.&#39;  But then of course, oops, there goes their adoring acolytes, and there goes their inflated egos.  As Max Planck noted, science progresses one funeral at a time.
Wow!
Entropy is a ‚Äòpathway&#39; which does not require ‚Äòenergy‚Äô to exist; at least some energy to push over a glass of liquid?
Hahahahaha.... same old stupidity... there is no way a system can be isolated due to dark energy... therefore seing those guys talking about entropy is disappointing and misleading.
My two favorite physicists (so far). Loved them in Sean&#39;s Mindscape podcast. These two talking about their field of expertise will never get boring or old.
Has the gravity been weak?<br>Do you know more about that, gravity?
Awareness is known by awareness alone.
James webb telescope works like Lord&#39;s view(in the bible)? Then why there is still flat earther?<br>School will teach now they can predict  2 electrons scattering without knowing superstring theory is right? What do you mean? I think you see every details through telescope however you must change storyS of what you see every time you are influenced by influencer. I wonder what&#39;s that?
String theory? Why they look for popularity? Youtube reveals their big name is being made exactly same way as other cooking youtubers. HAHA they laugh out loud over black hole thing..<br> Why they should conduct with other scientists&#39; achievements when they show lacking responsibilities on their own?
By <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2483">41:23</a> I had already two thoughts, 1.) a big bang inside of a big bang and ..2.),...being inside a black hole while being ate/coalescing by another smaller or larger black hole.  (The relation between gravity, electrons, negatively charged, and...the ability of the sun to harbour an electrical source. ) Nature abhors a vacuum. So I dont get how we cant see a vac that simply happens (with or (without) a big bang source to point to as the cause of everything is so impossible to imagine. Its interesting how Einstein was quoted using the word &#39;reality&#39; in some historical context, because at what stage of his scientific contributions did that happen, was he a young whippersnapper or an aging professor? Because did he mean a  future reality or past? Really interesting to hear mentioned that about the isolation chem students felt from one of Einsteins most famous equation. Great, great, great talk. Thank you!
Don‚Äôt need to know it?
The Theoretical Brothers.
what of this rumor that expansion has stopped????
Great stuff! - I love listening to these guys talking about these big questions!
Great guys, fairy tales‚Ä¶ it worths to buy a book :)
Very stimulating!   These guys are my rock stars.  I find it amazing that a few brilliant humans are starting to understand the fundamental nature of the universe.  Not bad for a bunch of sapiens who share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees.  I&#39;m currently trying to understand quantum gravity and the possibility of a theory that reconciles relativity with the quantum domain.  My hunch is no.
Fantastic
please get together for a casual dinner at a restaurant, the two of you with lenny susskind for about three hours, and stream it on youtube, it would be phenomenal for history.
Why don&#39;t the &quot;greatest thinkers of our time  talk about the &quot;platform&quot;  that causes the laws of nature to exist.  I will ask:  what is causing the laws of nature   physics constants,  spacetime geometry and quantum waves to exist?<br><br>Do we just assume, by physics magic üéâ, that physics constants,  spacetime geometry and quantum waves all exist for no reason?
Mostly fluff, speculative, could be, might be, don&#39;t know, who knows.. sorry to say. others can agree/disagree as they like..
yay more Science Fiction!
Nice to see the cool physics guys together!
Love Sean Carroll, we are lucky to have him in the science community. He has a fantastic understanding of all the models and I love how he can explain things clear and concise. I&#39;m one to believe that we could have Many Worlds and CCC both be partially right.  I don&#39;t see why there couldn&#39;t be Many Worlds as well as Cyclic Cosmology. Both really explain different things. Many worlds explains Quantum weirdness and probabilities and  CCC attempts to explain the start of the universe and end.
The only path out of this in my mind, that truly seems to fix the low entropy / early universe problem is something akin to Pentose‚Äôs Conformal Cyclical Cosmology, where the scale of the late high entropy universe no longer means anything, and you end up with a point where space ends up naturally falling back toward what looks like another big bang.<br><br>I know there might be issues with it, but it‚Äôs one of the few ways out that could make sense.<br><br>Brian and Sean, both of your collections of books have inspired me greatly! Much love ‚ù§
Where in NYC? He gives no address
Very nice! thanks for all the talks, sessions and conversations to expand scientific knowledge, approach and discoveries<br><br>Will the September sessions be streamed live in the channel?? I am eager to watch them!
i look at inflation as a fast but not instant process of appirance or change of field that give (quantum) time and thus the space a sense and during inflation time change radically, now time gradually slows down, that couse space expansion (observer visibility). Time changes because of that field change. Objects with mass change that field too, but massless particles only follows this field but not influence it because massless particles timeless in quantum sense.
matter and antimatter. Is the symmetry out of balance because we haven&#39;t found antimatter yet?<br>Matter + antimatter = nothing, not even energy, not even space
Always great to see Brian and Sean share their thoughts. Would be interesting to meet them over a beer and see how things go.
This is like 2 nerds talking, and I love it. I hope one day I would be capable to talk something like this with some other nerd.
‚ÄúIf it resonates with one of us, it will likely resonate with both of us‚Äù damn, sounds like some quantum entanglement between you and Sean!
I&#39;m struck by how you two sound so much like my high school friend and me marveling and somewhat debating, in circa 1971, about how the structure of the atom was essentially a tiny solar system. The only minor difference is that that concept is wrong and that you guys are brilliant and we were and are not. Otherwise -- remarkably similar.
Boltzman did not trust his  mathematically  conceived original  conjecture s&#39;&#39; origin  well enough to live long enough to get validation, did he?  BTW, 1 + 1 = 1 solves the entropy problem if you think about how the moebius band with its twist point adds 1 + 1 = 1 <br>is it a fact that anything man conceives will manifest eventually?
Most of us NYers don&#39;t know why the Manhattan Project is called the Manhattan Project? Smh wow I just learned something new...
If you run the math backwards on an expanding orange on a tree, you also end up with a big bang. You don&#39;t end up with a tree, a seed, and previous tress. Universe = same.
I enjoyed this so much! Thank you both
I am fascinated by this. <br><br>So fascinated that I went to the WSF website to see if I can quickly fly into NYC On Saturday!! <br><br>( I am a brand new attending physician :D)
Thank you gentleman, pure fun and nice to see Physics, Philosophy and Cosmology coming together.  Kim
Super symmetry, if you add the bias into it, perhaps it may be more fruitfull, because the asymmetry in assuming 50/50 or perfect evolutionary choice in evolving one way or another, may not be true for the reason aforementioned.<br>That there is an innate bias, which can be given thru recursion to space itself for example, the guarantee a certain kind of unpacking, so it is with kosmoses, and their inception.
46 min, the type of measurement may affect the data, purturbative vs. nonpurturbative for example.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2585">43:05</a> secs, entalgnlement may have to do with self similarity in space itself. Again this fractal nature of space... when volumes become symmetric.
Loop quatum gravity may be a bit of a distraction, the effect of accretion may have to do with space itself... it may be this underlying type of fractal domain in space.
when the energy is unpacked, it may be that the energy , since it is in fractilized space, lends kinetic energy to itself in the way it is unpacked via the gaps.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2427">40:27</a>, Profesor Carrol, you may want to use the equations for future sight is you want to make a more complete study of the arrow of time.
Thank you again for posting üôÇ
Since energy is stored in space that is fractilized at the core, its data unpacking can perhaps be thought of something like normilization, you can probably use Collatz Theorem as well, to study energy unpacking out of compressed fractilized space. Frame dragging is the outer boundary, staggered energy and gaps of space.
Thank you posting, I appreciate your effort in making these videos, and posting them. Have a great day, and find the Eternal part of the day, known as joy.
Perhaps order is seens in the collapsing and coalesence of the automated processes which produce the coalesced forms and matter. That is to say, they are inherent in the accretional processes which form a kosmos, and subsequently which give it its notes. This bias is inherent i think in ALL kosmoses, I dont think they just form 50/50 will develop life and the other will just have rocks lets say. the processes ensure that they DO both kosmoses for example , harbor life.
You know crap you full shiiiiiiiit

Ya know Sean really hasn&#39;t impressed me when his wife and he showed themselves to be so arrogant. Since then, eh, no thanks. Just another science communicator, just with a novel prize. See his arrogance is now rubbing off on me. This is your fault, Shawn!
*nobel
How did they show themselves to be ‚Äúarrogant‚Äù?
Dark matter is the longest ongoing mystery in cosmology. We don&#39;t know anything more about it than did Fritz Zwicky when he discovered it back in 1933.
The concept the universe is flat is as strange to me as the laws of entropy. Can you give a framework that might allow me to understand enough to ponder on the subject a bit?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=3620">1:00:20</a> I completely agree. QFT is equivalent to Newtonian physics. It&#39;s a good model, but there&#39;s a better answer which explains dark matter, dark energy, and where all the antimatter went.
What is this whole &quot;writing a paper&quot; thing? Can anybody write a paper? Do u get paid ?
The douche brothers
??? Are you just super religious or something?
I believe Brian Green is wrong about everything.
Love the Black Hole behind Brian! Dont get too close
I just don&#39;t enjoy listening to physicists anymore because they are so full of crap.  No new wisdom.  No new good ideas.  Several terrible ideas like MWI, repeating universes, etc.  Tired of being told by a bunch of liars that God doesn&#39;t exist.
ALL God&#39;s attributes were defined/given by Man who is uncomfortable with not knowing. Science/physics is excited by not knowing/mystery. It gives the motivation to solve the mystery. And so far, EVERYTIME a mystery was solved, it had a satisfactory physical explanation. NOT ONCE has there been a verified supernatural explanation for any solved mystery of the universe.
‚ÄúTired of being told by a bunch of liars that God doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù <br><br>Such a telling statement. You‚Äôre literally claiming the best thinkers in the world are ‚Äúfull of crap‚Äù because they don‚Äôt tell you what you want to hear. Sad stuff
You are GODüòâ
@@coreyleander7911 Isn&#39;t it amazing that the same people who scoff at the existence of GOD, also can&#39;t tell you how the laws of nature/physics, physics constants or spacetime geometry can exist without any visible or physical means?  As if by magic.
@@wulphstein no they tell us how the laws of physics, physical constants, and ‚ÄúSpacetime geometry‚Äù exist. And they tell us precisely how by physical means and laws. <br><br>What does it say about you that you‚Äôre <b>just</b> angry that you don‚Äôt understand the science, thus your false claim of it being magic, and are angry it won‚Äôt tell you what you want to hear about God? It‚Äôs a cowardice about mortality more than anything. <br><br>If you want to play this game, then you should be talking about how physicists don‚Äôt understand the origin of the Big Bang. But again, you don‚Äôt understand the science so you make the stronger false claim that they don‚Äôt understand anything else about physics, or the origin of it.
Lately, to some extent my scientific and philosophical mind has become somewhat dominated by the all but certain fact that there are far more advanced beings out there in our universe that have all the answers to all the questions that occupy our minds. It occurs to me that what we need to do is learn to be better at being social beings in our universe, and the answers may come to us by way of a shortcut from the friendship of others.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=908">15:08</a> Pacific<br>As an object with mass is accelerated towards ‚Äúc‚Äù it‚Äôs length is shortened in the direction of travel and its experience of time shortened.  At the speed of light it‚Äôs length and it‚Äôs experience of time would be zero. In other words it would become a 2 dimensional object without the experience of time!  Therefore objects with mass require a dimension through which they can move and experience time. Time requires dimensionality and dimensionality requires time.( Is this the true meaning of spacetime?)
I have just decided recently at 30 years old that physics is the field i want to pursue my whole life and everything around this seems to be disappointing and trying to make me quit believing the I actually can.

Entropy is not what we are witnessing in the cosmos. Humans witness entropy and close systems on earth. Time is the fabric of the universe. Time is not a closed system. Time is it open system. Matter has to be able to flow through time freely, in order for the universe to function the way that it does.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=4220">1:10:20</a> Two unknown constants were still present in the required equations: a and Œõ(0), and now it was required that in the case of a weak curvature of space-time (a weak gravitational field), the Poisson equation was obtained from here. This is the case when a=-1/2, Œõ(0)=0, that is, in 1915 Einstein wrote down his equations without Œõ(0), which ensured &quot;The great success of Einstein&#39;s theory.&quot; (Pauli). However, being convinced of the correctness of his philosophical beliefs, alas, physicist Einstein in 1917 decided to change the equations by adding the term Œõ(0)g(ik). But after Friedmann&#39;s solution (1922) and Hubble&#39;s discovery (1927), there was no need to add a cosmological term, and the equations restored friendship with the Poisson equation.<br><br>It seems that modern manipulations with Œõ(0)=(8œÄG/c^4)T[v(00)], where T[v(00)] is the vacuum energy density (spacetime) in a locally Lorentzian accompanying frame of reference, are devoid of physical justification, since in Einstein&#39;s theory there are no solutions for a completely empty and to attribute any properties (for example, acceleration) to something unknown, obviously, a simple fitting of the theory to observational data to the detriment of &quot;great success&quot;. <br><br>How would Einstein react to this? Probably like this: &quot;A good joke should not be repeated twice.&quot; (Einstein).
As politics in US depends on &#39;pay for play&#39;, so in science &#39;a brief tour of everything&#39; is like someone has stopped all funding to physicists. They can continue arguing when gravity isn&#39;t quantized or how QM fails to show how probabilistic world can become deterministic. Physicists look like politicians like Zelensky.
It‚Äôs really clear MAGAts like you are simply jealous and angry at the size of the gap of knowledge between uneducated people like you and graduate school educated physicists. Thus you resort to simpler things you can understand like politics to understand physics. It‚Äôs so sad and telling. Imagine thinking being compared to Zelenskyy is an insult
Listening to these smartest gentlemen gives hope that humanity is not doomed...
Just read the comments on this video to see it is in fact doomed. Right wingers desperately trying to politicize physics and science.

Is it possible that when we look back from the present space and time instance down the rabbit hole into the trajectory to the big bang, we may arrive, not at one single but an unlimited number of big bangs in space? <br><br>Is it possible that the chosen trajectory into the past rather depends on the countless individual branches you choose in the cloud of branches (as opposed to a tree of branches)? <br><br>Would that alter our ideas with regard if the arrow of time, ie would it be a sphere of time which leads to countless small bangs, bangs in the order of quantum sized energy fluctuations which collectively, by bringing them all together in an imaginary spot in space time, looks like a big bang with a mysterious beginning out of a singularity? Any thoughts about that?

It‚Äôs insane that you right wingers don‚Äôt see the obvious. You‚Äôre literally desperately trying to politicize science and discredit it because you know it doesn‚Äôt give you the answers you want on religion or climate. Truly evil what you people do ‚Äî trying to hold back human progress
@worldsciencefestival thank you for providing this space and sharing this conversation, thank you Brian and Sean for allowing us to listen in on this conversation. Peace
Can&#39;t we just say God made everything , and stop complicating things.?
Saying, God made everything is what complicates things. The universe is simple. The theory of everything is time. Time is everything and everything is time. Simple. We experience time through our star the sun. What is your age? No star no growth. What are you breathing? No oxygen, no consciousness. Don‚Äôt test nature by holding your breath. Breathe! While breathing read more non-fiction. Dictionary. Encyclopedia. Thesaurus.
It‚Äôs so obvious what you right wingers are doing. As the gap between uneducated people like you and the most educated people like physicists and mathematicians grows, you feel resentment at what you don‚Äôt understand. So you try to negate all of human progress so you can feel better about your chosen intellectual inferiority. Enraging
@@tyroneallen7857why do you talk like this? Nothing you said in this reply is correct. Time is not everything, especially not energy like you‚Äôve said elsewhere.
IF THIS HELPS,I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE &quot;THE ARROW OF TIME&quot; CAN GO SLOWER THAN NORMAL,THAT&#39;S ALL I KNOW FOR SURE!!
I thought that with the findings from the James Webb, the idea of the Big Bang has been put to rest, but unless I am mistaken, both these eminent scientists mentioned it as the starting point of our Universe. Can someone clarify please?
These &quot;news&quot;, that Big Bang &quot;has been put to rest&quot; were typical internet pop science misinformation...
But it hasn‚Äôt been put to rest. Stop being a layman
Just saw this and I‚Äôm totally geeking out right now üòÖ
two of my faves! I could listen to you both for literally hours
Nice orators, though I would argue some things they say.  The multiverse nonsense and how easy it is to disprove. Black holes censorship, time and particle production at energy dinsities. Inflation with FTL and no FTL in a vacuum seen. Alice strings and rings and the ALICE detector. String theory E8, and E24 and which fits better with quantum theories. Color theory and snark graph theory with gluons and photons connecting border states. Planet crackers and killers. Fluidic neutrinos in blach holes. I could go on, but no point. Black hole ‚ôæÔ∏è is a lack of calculation and the distortion of time/space. 2 limits come from that. Students have done some of that work with when black holes evaporate. Gripes over. Keep spreading info, maybe one day one of your people will get to talk to me. lol not holding breath. The religious delusions tend to keep people held back in ways. Good luck with wonderland. XD
I truly love these two men. So good to see them together!!!!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
This was a fantastic and engaging show all the way through! Thank you.

It would reverse sign and the repulsive force would grow asymptotically below the LQG scale a ~P.l.^1.6. Hence a bounce scenario is supported by LQG.
Shame?
@@coreyleander7911 Sean is a cosmologist, he should be aware of major advances in LQG which is foundational to Loop Quantum Cosmology.
thank you WSF
Thank you for the Uploads! Maybe soon some about Quantum Entanglement; whilst Symmetry is broken, for Matter to do it&#39;s Gravity?!
Maybe some big bounce, rather than a big bang in it. Not necessarily CCC
So In reguards to entropy it‚Äôs because of the Higgs mechanism! If it‚Äôs fundamental is also important!
If there was a concept that links the nature and source of gravity with the strong Nuclear ‚ÄúForce‚Äù, the mechanisms of Dark Energy, and Dark Matter, would it be worth a moment‚Äôs consideration? Particularly as it seems physics is in a ‚Äúwhat are we not seeing‚Äù state regarding Gravity?

If supposedly the dark energy expansion rate has varied throughout the history of the universe than it would also be admissible a sudden and exponential inflation after the big bang.
You and Shaun appear to be ENTANGLED PERSONS!!!
This is awesome.
Interesting to see that both Carroll and Greene have no idea what the arrow of time is, or time, for that matter. Carroll, again, comes up with entropy, which in essence has got nothing to do with time. Time doesn&#39;t run backward in your fridge. And let me tell you a secret, the supposed arrow of time doesn&#39;t even exist at all. Both Carroll and Greene, like many physicists, confuse reversible, cyclic and oscillating reactions (or laws of physics) with what time is and how it functions. Simply said, you cannot go back in time, which shows that the arrow of time doesn&#39;t exist.
When you started talking about the arrow of time going in both directions it got me thinking. If we could get ourselves to move &quot;backwards&quot; in time, could that just mean that we stop moving in our own time and just start moving in the forward direction of a mirrored universe? Then when we stop our &quot;backwards&quot; time direction, we&#39;re right back at the same time as when started in our own universe?
I think that something √Æs missing in conven»õional naratives. Fields bring order, structure, Fields create order energy, energy √Æs conected with Information, Information May obey some laws that minimise desorder. So, we have 2 oposite tendency, order and desorder. Flow of Time √Æs conected with low presence of antimater. Quantum microspaces entangled, 4 for fotons, thetraedral structures and complex structures composed by mathematical lows conduct to identity of elementar particles, teleportation for all movements, frames of reality, paralel realities, not √Æn faze, historys made by entangled events, Time √Æs just a parameter associated with one  univers history, we can do quantum jump from one history to other by a change of faze.

Very interesting conversation by two contemporary physicists.
Absolutely the best!
I mean, who noticed the Flash title track modified was the opening track! üòÖ
I like the World Science Festival.  But it almost seems to cover only physics, and astronomy these days.  I wish they spent more time having guest on that covered more fields of study and specialties.
Love Sean and Brian, they both have done this so much and are very skilled at public science information and should be rewarded for their incredible contribution to public general knowledge.
I am SO happy! My two favorite physicists together. Can life get any better? I don‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶
Brilliant. Realistically, what can I hope to add to what&#39;s already been said below / before.  I would guess that most of this audience are fans of one or both, of either Brian Greene or Sean Carroll anyway. There is also a Mindscape episode where Brian is the guest. That is pretty good as well -  and I&#39;m sure it is still available on Sean&#39;s Mindscape Channel.  And they have both written some great books - especially in high-quality, popular science for the non-specialist. Many thanks to both Prof. Brian and Prof. Sean. for sharing this enlightening conversation. Please do this again soon, when Entropy is just a bit higher !!
Great talk all the best. ...
Wow these two guys together
There is another way of looking at the arrow of time and showing that time must always move in the positive direction.<br><br>Just think about light. The speed of light is positive, distance is always positive. Distance = speed x time so time must always move in the positive direction.<br><br>Even though the mathematical equations allow time to move in the positive or negative direction, in reality it only moves in the positive direction. Richard
Speaking of the big discrepancy between the observed dark energy value and the calculated one, I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re surprised there is such a discrepancy. We know there is dark matter out there and if there are dark matter fields, then we haven&#39;t included the contribution of these fields to the dark energy. If supersymmetry is also true (at higher energies than what the Large Hadron Collider can probe), then these fields also contribute to the zero point energy.<br><br>So we shouldn&#39;t be surprised that we have such a big discrepancy between the observed and the calculated value considering we&#39;re missing these contributions.<br><br>I actually think that maybe we have some symmetry where the value is zero, but the symmetry is broken at our low energy scales and this returns this very low value that we observe (10^-8 ergs/cm^3) instead of zero (this is just a hunch, I wish someone with the actualy quantum field theory knowledge could come up with a model).
What a wonderful surprise to wake up to this treat!
I&#39;m so glad that Brian mentioned the idea of very long random fluctuations that, just by chance, at some point end up just being uniformly distributed such that they start inflating: it&#39;s been my own idea on how the universe started from low entropy for quite some time. If you have fluctuations (although I&#39;m not sure where this is happening - do you need an already existing spacetime where these fluctuations happen or do we have fluctuations of spacetime itself, like a &quot;bubble&quot; of spacetime with different energy distributions popping in and out of &quot;nothing&quot;?) that happen continuously, then at some point, just by chance, a particular fluctuation will have its energy distributed uniformly and in it inflation will start, expanding that bubble and not allowing it to collapse back. <br><br>Since the positive energy in that fluctuation can be compensated exactly by gravity with negative energy, the fluctuation will have zero total energy and therefore will be able to live forever (here I&#39;m referring to the uncertainty principle between energy and time).<br><br>This way, only low entropy fluctations create universes, since only low entropy fluctuations can inflate, they are the only ones for which gravity behaves repulsively. So it&#39;s not a mystery why we started from a low entropy state.
The universe can be described as a collection of QUANTAM SUPER MAGNETS with Black hole. at negative pole and positive point spewing out recombined energy particles at the point observed as BIG BANG POINT.  <br>With our limited capacity to observe,  our Scientists postulate theories like BLIND MEN AND ELEPHANT.  Benefit of this situation( state of ignorance)  is there is evergreen scope of new PhDs and voluminous articles and heaps of books. <br>Now to define the universe  is <br>IT IS MULTJDIMENTIAL AND DYNAMIC WEB OF TANGLED MAGNETS WITH BLACK HOLES AT ONE END OF ENTANGLEMENT AND BIG BANG POINT AT OTHER END
My two heros unite
Thank you for this.
Will any of the events next week be live streamed? It seems tockets are only for physical admission.
entropy is the flow of energy to a state of balance in relation to the system, so light loses its energy or, roughly speaking, goes out after covering vast distances, just like an electromagnetic wave attenuates over a distance
expansion of space is an illusion
Hi professor brian green and sean caroll is my favourite physicist and science communicators I have been watched their videos for nearly four years when I was in my secondary High school
Entanglement is a simple manifestation of karmic resonances between the merkabas of two souls or soul collectives. It is the same phenomenon that underlies paranormal experiences, and why dabbling with spiritual powers irresponsibly can get you in a lot of trouble if you tangle with demonic daemons
so-called entanglement is nothing more than a coincidence
@Va1demar¬† Don&#39;t be so sure of that. That&#39;s what all NPC souls think till they exercise their consciousness enough to spot their own synchronicities. I get a kick out of Pinocchio souls thinking they are the sharpest tools in the shed of humanity, so sure of their singular perspective because it&#39;s so narrow. NPC humans are like single slit experiments to more conscious observers

@@Va1demar yeah they are and yeah they can. Just because there are things they haven‚Äôt yet been explained doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt. Everything you‚Äôre engaging in at this very moment, except perhaps consciousness, is entirely explained by physics and thus math. The device you‚Äôre communicating on, your biology, your location in space/galaxy, etc. Just because we don‚Äôt yet have a complete description of consciousness or the origin of what we call the Big Bang doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt. We are steadily making progress on both questions.
@coreyleander7911¬† toot your small horn, NPC. Your programming is obvious. FYI I have studied physics cat Princeton, and know for more than you about the realities of science, which contraryvto what numby gumbirs like you think, is not decided by the consensus of the self-proclaimed high priests of materialist scientism
@@coreyleander7911 The devices on which we communicate are called words and logical apparatus, and how do physics and mathematics explain this?
@@theomnisthour6400 ‚Äúsmall horn‚Äù ‚ÄúNPC‚Äù ‚Äúyour programming is obvious‚Äù literally only ad hominem here. This is the problem. The gap between the educated and uneducated only continues to grow and this makes the uneducated like you resentful.

You certainly weren‚Äôt educated in physics from Princeton, there‚Äôs no reason to lie further. And there aren‚Äôt priests that decide what physics is. Again, this is your political populism coming to the fore. You think this is political because that‚Äôs the limit of what you can understand ‚Äî you can‚Äôt understand the physics or math so you reduce it falsely to something you do understand, politics. Your anger also seems to be with physicalism and materialism, and how that leads one to doubt the existence of a God or souls.

@@Va1demar you‚Äôre kidding? We‚Äôre not communicating right now over the internet and some type of computer? To answer your question though, are you seriously unaware of the field of linguistics ‚Äî the study of language? It is rigorously based on *mathematics*.
@@coreyleander7911 Linguistics is strictly connected with semiotics, mathematics was not nearby, what can you say about space without reference points?
@@Va1demar no. Linguistics is based on set theory and mathematical logic. So mathematics is not only ‚Äúnearby,‚Äù it comprises and makes up linguistics at its core. We measure locations in space relative to the galactic center and other galaxies ‚Äî with physics. Lol. If you‚Äôre referring to an absolute location in the <b>universe,</b> that can‚Äôt be done given the finite speed of light and cosmic inflation. These concepts are all precise and known because of physics and thus math.
@@coreyleander7911 and if light does not propagate in space indefinitely, but is limited not only in speed, but also in radius, what can you say then about the size of the universe? if you are based on confirmed and verifiable facts, then who checked the range of the light beam?
@@Va1demaryour comments are no longer appearing in my notifications. Light does propagate in space indefinitely. We can currently see light from the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave background. What do you mean ‚Äúwho checked the range of the light beam‚Äù? We can‚Äôt say anything about the size of the overall universe, since light hasn‚Äôt had time to reach farther than it has. We can only talk about the observable universe, where light has so far reached.
@@coreyleander7911 did you see the farthest objects well? what Webb showed can hardly be called clear and obvious, your understanding of the universe is also limited by the resolving power of the telescope, the better the telescope, the older the universe turns out to be, in general, your boasting does not distinguish you in any way from the applicants with whom you argued earlier, you look like a fanatical adherent of the canonical church that fights sinners who reject your faith in the almighty god of science
@@Va1demar so you‚Äôre repeating the false headline you read about JWST showing the universe to be 26 billion years old or whatever? The fact you think me merely stating that I study mathematics and physics is boasting is my whole point: you uneducated people resent that you don‚Äôt understand math and physics like some of us or try to do, and even resent us for doing so &amp; getting angry when people like you invoke religion or claim science has established nothing. <br><br>Again everything you say is an indictment: you quite literally call people getting angry at someone who lies quantum entanglement is a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù manifestation of ‚Äúkarmic resonances‚Äù as adhering to religion and faith, and trying to punish sinners. Just incredible. To you, science is just another ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when by the very definition of science that is false. Faith is by definition a belief without evidence. Science <b>only</b> operates on evidence. <br><br>I can‚Äôt understand why people like you exist, just desperately trying to halt or slow human progress
@@coreyleander7911 who proved that there was a big bang? you took this belief on faith, who measured the universe and proved that it is expanding? you accepted this belief on faith because you didn‚Äôt measure it yourself and you have no evidence, you are a believing adherent of the church of scientists also it turns out they‚Äôre preventing you from thinking and promoting discoveries, making progress, it turns out you‚Äôre also a schizoid
My two heroes. ‚ù§<br>Fascinating that chemists in 2005 thought E=mc^2 was irrelevant to chemistry.

I guess i had a pretty good science education!
The multiverse is a progressive set of experiments that converge on virtual worlds without beginning or end, enabled by the fully developed individual string of God, a template pattern for other souls to dance around, as they play with their own universal identity simulations till they find a felicitous dance floor for their unique or shared karmic resonances. It&#39;s not all possible universes, it&#39;s all desired universes for as long as there is enough spiritual energy to sustain the thought that created each universe and gave some time and space for its dance floor till it&#39;s god&#39;s or goddess&#39; music attracts no more conscious dancers and becomes a stagnant universe of NPC souls entertaining the lonely mind of a loveless deity till they choosevto reassimilate with BORG, to develop a new pattern of identity that might be more attractive. All discussions of single universes are stale scientific dead ends, devoid of the spirit that breathed life into the multiverse. The proof of tge multiverse lies in simple deduction from the big bang, which was obvious lying a duoverse, a universe and an anti universe evolving under the leadership of conflicting principles. This dual test tubes of conflicting principles is in evidence at all levels of creation, and is what  is driving the existential crisis of our species - developing a better government for souls of all ages, strengths and weaknesses. Humanity is the final chosen species of this grand social engineering experiment, and the final major version of the laws of reincarnation and karma are the product of the Gaia experiment&#39;s conclusion

I‚Äôm confused. Wasn‚Äôt the egg originally just particles which genes brought together, thereby showing a reverse of entropy. Also, stars take small hydrogen to make the larger helium - again the reverse of entropy. The creation of planets, or trees, or animals all seem to bring a balance instead of a one way trip.
TLDR; Creating an egg requires the existence of low entropy source like sun and overall entropy of the universe does increase. Hydrogen to helium conversion is high entropy transformation because the situation is messier than before(released energy going in various directions)<br><br>Creation of the egg does require entropy reversal. But that comes from somewhere else. In order to reverse entropy for the egg molecules, animals need to take entropy from somewhere else: plants etc. Plants get their entropy from the sun. Which ultimately leads back to big bang. The overall entropy of the universe is  increasing , some local parts may reverse entropy like an air conditioner cooling a room, but that increases the overall entropy of the universe.<br><br>As for the sun, hydrogen going into helium leads to more entropy. Because the energy (light etc) that is released during conversion between nuclei can spread around in many ways and keeping track of that is harder than the state before the conversion. It&#39;s more messy and more entropy has been added.

Looks like you are discussing relativity in a few short paragraph, lol. Good line of thinking. Sharing a parallel not too dissimilar line of thought. Dimensions are dimensions because each dimension can be independent of the other, at least in space this works - x, y, z. Time flows independent of the x, y, and z, only both are affected by universal constant, c the speed of light. Now because of that, x,y,z, and t need to obey that rule of constancy of c. So space contracts, time dilates, and space curves. Now, when we take into account that measurements are affected by the speed light, it gets more interesting in the cosmological and quantum scales.

This was written about year and half ago and  rewritten two days ago on real physics YouTube channel:<br>Here you find the explanation of why Time is a process not a dimension, you have to read till the end to be able to understand: There‚Äôs a difference between Time is the measurement and Time is a process l, because time is the process of measurement (that is why they couldn‚Äôt understand what time is till this moment ), clock hands (minutes and hours) are the reference (memory) the calculation of seconds (The tick of the clock, and oscillation in atomic clocks )  is present time (future in clocks has different approach, clock itself doesn‚Äôt recognise future)<br>to concise the whole process is time (it‚Äôs a PROCESS)<br>in human brain the whole process in clocks takes place but humans have memory and can anticipate future (next step based on previous experiences or calculations but in clocks they have fixed pace unless something happens to seconds hand ) so in human brain there‚Äôs a whole process (ticking or oscillation, processing ‚Äúincluding cognition ‚Äú and memory.<br>in human brain the processing itself is the present time and the result of processing is the past time ‚Äúin memory‚Äù.<br>in pysics it requires space to calculate time, but in human brain probably works at level close to Planck‚Äôs length,. in human brain there are more than one clock, one is very accurate such as how humans reach perfecrion in shooting, and other games, and inacurate clock that works in conscious experience (daily life) and that is more effective (no need for high accuracy). clocks can‚Äôt recognise time but human brain can. there‚Äôs action but could be quantum action or possible mental action in the brain too (but very likely Quantum action) (so-called Quantum action could be the minimum action). talking about space here is in the classical physics (normal equations where we calculate speed and distance) but that is the core of clocks in general (time = distance / speed) the shift in seconds hand.  but there‚Äôs minimum action (Planck‚Äôs scale). mental clock requires action too but different approach. to concise human brain can recognise time unlike clocks (it‚Äôs a process). Planck is one of the best former scientists.<br><br>Hopefully the idea is clear, I hardly can focus.<br><br>I think the idea is that time is a bit complicated: why do you need the minute hand and the hour hand? Because time is a process and not just the ticking of the seconds hand, here I am talking about the conventional scale of ordinary clocks , and I am not talking about the scale of atomic clocks, but it is the same idea at the end. but there‚Äôs a big difference: clocks can‚Äôt recognise the ticks of seconds hand but humans can.<br><br>There‚Äôs a mental clock for sure: it‚Äôs the result of continuous approximate calculations of dimensions and speed, it‚Äôs inaccurate but very effective in usual daily activities such as: is that narrow road is enough to my car to pass through?!, but there‚Äôs other type of time which is very accurate and very likely based on physical clock similar to atomic clocks.<br><br>to reach perfection in some shooting sports (repeatable) indicate that there is a very accurate clock (probably more accurate than modern clocks), in human brain (very likely) it is in cerebellum, accompaned with  other accurate caluculqtions such as wind speed,‚Ä¶.etc. of course all that happen unknowingly.<br>There is a huge difference between the fact that time is a process and the explanations of previous physicists (there can be no middle ground for this and even trying to approximate the logic behind them will not work)<br>They even had no deep understanding of the most important and seemed simple equation: speed = distance √∑ time<br>the role of energy and how they calculated time!<br>This seemingly simple physics equation shows how they took time and space as axioms and built on that, but that is not the solution to a deep understanding of the foundations of physics (current physics has reached its limits). This simple equation is absolutely the most important physical equation and shows the relationship between the most important foundations of physics and the extent of the current superficial understanding.<br>The interrelationships between the speed, distance and time says that there‚Äôs a very weak understanding of the fundamentals of physics.<br><br>Notice: dates are older (copies of previous thoughts)
what is great is that these two don&#39;t always see eye to eye, but the discussion keeps us all honest, if they have to argue, then that means they are sincere.
W = MG<br>gravitational force  vs  gravitational acceleration.<br>potential energy vs gravitational potential energy.<br>equivalent principle; the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass.<br>,‚Ä¶..etc<br>Everything indicate that the current interpretation of equivalent principle is incorrect: very likely Gravity interacts with each particle independently regardless of its location to other particles in the same object, and that is why all objects fall at the same rate. <br>That‚Äôs far better interpretation of : <br>W = MG<br>gravitational force  vs  gravitational acceleration.<br>potential energy vs gravitational potential energy.<br>equivalent principle; the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass.<br>Physics needs to be reviewed by real physicists, but this will require a deeper understanding of the foundations of physics.
There is still a huge chance we know absolutely nothing and everything is an illusion or a simulation.
No not at all. There‚Äôs a huge chance in the other direction given all the experimental evidence to the contrary.
Accidentally, it happens to break from an equilibrium; now eagerly waiting for a moment to be back on its initial state. Unfortunately,  all the attempt makes it more complex  rather to be settle. Fortunately we itself are the building blocks of this UNFORTUNATE. Surely we find our home,  let us sail hardly...
Do people agree that without quantum entanglement we could not have E=MC^2.  Meaning that to get the formula to work something has to happen faster (at least at the quantum level) than the speed of light.

Brian and Sean‚Ä¶ the 2 best online physics tutors! Excellent guys
The gayest passive aggressive fight I‚Äôve ever scene
Hello Dr Brian Greene! Recently, I watched an interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson, where he refused to accept any place of philosophy in modern day Physics. What is your point of view on the topic?
professor Sean Carrol is my favorite physicist in the world. He is such an awesome science communicator..Brian  green is also legend as well...hyped fork this discussion...
Watching on repeat‚Äîbut this is keeping me from getting to my wordle! üòÇüòÇüòÇ.  Agree‚Äîeasier to watch together than have to watch them both and say‚Äîoh yea those two are on the same page.
I could listen to these two all day
Please broadcast the talk between you, Sean and Carlo Rovelli of the 23d of september. We need it ‚ù§
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2220">37:00</a> ish - ‚Ä¶ and what is the LOWEST entropy state of the universe? Is it in line with current theory to say that at the time of the Big Bang, the universe was in that lowest entropy state? I think it is. But does that mean that as entropy TRENDS upwards over time, LOCAL decreases of entropy can never go below that initial entropy measure? If that is the case, the object currently known to us as the lowest entropy object in the universe, the human brain, must have a level of entropy HIGHER than that of the Big Bang. Would that be a fair characterisation of the dynamics? If anybody shared their insights on this, I‚Äôd appreciate it.
You guys have no idea that there is a Creator who has taught me everything beyond what you can only dream about. By the way, we are living our Creator&#39;s dream ( programming ) for each individual created mind that is processing his programmed thoughts into what looks like a real world but only as an illusion. There is no real universe and never has there been one.
Why is it so hard for human-oids to imagine some sparkles and then there is space time. <br>Nothing has to be &quot;there&quot; for something to create &quot;there&quot;. And once &quot;there&quot; exists, space time sits on &quot;it&quot; like a duck on the water. And if you are honest, you KNOW quantum fluctuations exist AND do things YOU can`t explain...
They originally attempted to do this interview in person, but the mass of their brains together in 1 room caused gravitational distortions.
You mean space distortion, right?
These two guys are my favourite science communicators - I attended Sean‚Äôs talk at the Royal Institution in London the other week and he was absolutely brilliant. What I love about his style is that he tries to make the maths behind the formulae approachable. Of course it won‚Äôt replace a university degree but a layperson with some mathematical background (perhaps A-level, college general studies level) will develop a far deeper understanding of the subject than they might get from reading journalistic articles or some of the books in the pop-science genre that are out there.<br><br>I think Brian and Sean do a great job also in getting young people to study science, maybe those who are ‚Äòon the fence‚Äô, who have an interest in the subjects but are unsure about a full-blown university degree. To those, listening to their excellent podcasts and reading their books must be like fanning the embers of a fire.
Lucky yo!!! The rest of us will just have to wait until the RI releases a YouTube broadcast.
At my house, plural of math, is, wait for it, .... math!! lol    Now onto my &quot;five a day&quot;. lmao.   &quot;Right&quot;. &quot;Brillant&quot;. &quot;Garden&quot;. A different world.

Science rocks alright but, Science of the Body now there&#39;s A Thing; but for differing interpretations &amp; kno Actual Experience: That Matters a great deal you know {Evidence}, over &amp; against Manipulation of Results!?! {\}
Glad to listen them thank you
Why not both of you do some knitting while talking?
IMO there is confusion between - Entropy increases in the direction of time (makes sense because of the nature of state space) and it&#39;s corollary time direction is because of increasing entropy (NOT). I agree with former, not the later.
Exactly, as I pointed out in my comment a few minutes ago. Both mix up entropy and flow of time (which doesn&#39;t exist, as the arrow of time doesn&#39;t exist),
What Sean does, studying astrophysics and quantum physics and philosophy is what leads to spirituality !! <br>This knowledge can bring Nirvana to anyone who understands it ‚ù§
Now you need to define Nirvana
Why is minkowski space metric (negative sign in the distance equation)  different than a Euclidean space metric? Isn&#39;t that the explanation for direction of time being only one way?
Two of my favorites at once!  Really excited to watch this!  Thank you so much for making these videos!
- [ ] A brief tour of the future <br>- [ ] Certainly AI within the next 25 years will change humanity and the anthropic principle forever. If humanity survives 50 years from now how will self learning AI influence and interact with humanity?<br>- [ ] I love the characters Data and his brother Lore as examples of self learning artificial intelligence. However, if humans are to survive with artificial intelligence in the future the Borg model is more likely. Humanity will most likely have to stay connected to the internet at all times resembling the queen bee model. I would assume self learning AI at some point would see the depravity of humanity as an inconsistently problem. For both to survive together humanity will have to change. Or?<br>- [ ]    I think the important thing to remember is that self learning AI combined with quantum computing and unbreakable encryption codes that will allow the ability of artificial intelligence computers to connect to other AI quantum computers and  then form their own AI languages and self learning technologies blocking man out of the process. If humanity and its inconsistency and depravity are seen as a threat, what will happen to humanity?<br>- [ ]    50 years from now if humanity survives, the anthropic principle will certainly be changed by self learning artificial intelligence. Moreover, as AI and quantum computer inductive predictive programming increases to the doubling of processing power from 18 months down to say 1  hour every hour combined with deductive processing power, where and what will humans be? Will they be attached to AI like the Borg model or at war like the Sky Net model?<br>- [ ] This subject matter would be perfect for the next Star Trek movie. <br>- [ ] I would love to help out with that.
I do not get the reversibility of time discussion around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=710">11:50</a>. If there are two oppositely charged particles near each other, the process of them coming closer or moving away is by definition breaking the law of opposite charges attract. Am I missing something? Even in two billiard balls colliding example the two will be hotter after collision in one direction and not the other. No?<br><br>IMO opinion, there is a confusion due to circularity between the definition of forward and backward when it applies to time. Time simply has direction, forward, and it is the direction in which before event and after events go - refer to Tim Maudlins thoughts on this. Time is a dimension but a time like dimension at that and is not a space like dimension. The Minkowski metric of SR spacetime tells us that. So SR spacetime is not a 4D object of 4 dimensions that are qualitatively similar but a 3(spacelike D)+1(time liked D) object. And thus the forward and backward notions that do apply to space-like Ds should not be applicable to time-like D. Think of it this way - a  +ve and -ve altitude of a place relative to sea level can be a meaningful physical concept. But +3 apples is a physical concept but -3 apples is not a physical concept. The talk of forward and reverse time is just not applicable.
Be welcome. <br>Simmetries and concepts also, as ever, we are inspired by the sum of your communicating efforts and hope in other people üôèüóΩ <br>Aware of our belief, continue, never stop, like inertial movement in a particular medium.<br>You both are looking greatüëå.
How do you respond to Tim Maudlin&#39;s view on the arrow of time?
August 7th &#39;23 I emailed Sean&#39;s team, and also Susskind, because I found (pic is in my community post) dated paper by me pre 2013 Susskind&#39;s ER=EPR,, saying &#39;wormhole physics&#39; and I linked wormholes to String Theory as Einstein crystalized time, and +4d string hyperspace &#39;loaf&#39; explains quantum entanglement particle spin correlation as crystalized spacetime in hyperspace, dated Aug. 3rd, 2011. I knew I&#39;d thought of it in &#39;07, but I found evidence I had, pre ER=EPR, while watching sn6 ep3 of The Big Bang Theory where sheldon gets help looking thru old stuff,, I saw the line after i looked thru my stuff.. &#39;m very smart n my subconscious must of known I had yhe paper somewhere. I got 100% grade for semester learning Calculus in high school, and am also diagnosed schizophrenic and voices tell me what is about yo happen in shows, so if I&#39;m not like John Nash schiz. then I&#39;m smart and a real person wanted me to find my paper, either way.<br>In the paper, in my community post, I say the whole universe &#39;dna to celestial bodies&#39;, which is like this vids title, so maybe Sean suggested it because of me, idk.. or it is a known thing to reference,, theory of linked quantum and Relativity theories with examples. Check my pic in my community post. Like yo, guys, i have more. And i can use such in my scifi story &quot;psy v cy&quot; psychics vs cyborgs PvC, and like theory,, if JWST shows we&#39;re in a blackhole, then I show how an or the original universe doesnt ER=EPR into or out of a blackhole,, inside a blackhole has more degrees of freedom or dimensions,, but i suggest that such is for fields for forces and particles,, our 4 force fields are how String Theory 11Ds are, we are a hyperverse and outside our membrane aka universe aka blackhole?? is more dimensions as in forces, and in a blackhole is less (the thought about part for blackholes, but hey Susskind says noone knew ER=EPR stuff, but i guess i did at latest in 2011, before him in 2013, so what else did i theorize first). A video from World Science Festival on er=epr quantum wormholes said blackholes &#39;er=epr&#39; Hawking Radiation, but me.. that is how we could go into a parent universe, then the origin universe does decay but instead grows dimensions as in cyclic universe, and could be dark energy and matter. From quantum fluctuations as HUP Heisenberg Uncerainty Principle and that is still embedded in existence from nothingness (Sean knows nothing, not space. Exactly, space is not nothing, nothing is nothing) for how universe or existence comes about, and yhat is the definition of space as different local spots relative to eachother and different times, nothing is different from the start of nothing as something,  me 0 into 1 i stance of 0, 1(0). Then that is soacetime growing and info entropy growing, relative to eachtoher, and then energy and matter grow  from space growing in 1(0) instances of space but as a field, which is how and why origin universes grow like cyclic universe theory into having more fields.
???
@@peterdamen2161 oh, uh how Sean and Brian mentioned infinity, also 1/0 is nonsense answer, and 1(0) that I show has 1 thing, but when you take out the (0) of it, ur doing /0, which is undefined and gets a nonsense answer. I think, it is like finding a limit in Calculus or precalc where one find the proportions of like (x¬≥+1)/x¬≤ and it is approaching like the proportion of the limits ,,i dont think that is what one does but it is just &#39;like&#39; that, finding proptions of infinity. Like 10¬π¬≤‚Å∞ dark matter or energy mentioned, is there a way to make it versus amount of space itself, so space and dark stuff is proportional.. if this is accounted for, then i think it just shows space may be bigger than we thought, FI the JWST sees our universe may be twice as old, 28billion years, as what was thought before. Like higgs ?operation?  might not be an accepted but it is already kneon thing.
Inflation is the true theory, it is proven by experiment every month when I realize my money is worth less than before.

Great show guys thanks much. The language follows scripture well. I enjoyed translating this show and using my understanding to learn from you.  Folks , In God We Trust is not a logo. What does it mean you? To all of us? Being under one God means all of us. We need to learn to use it all together!
Physics and science has absolutely nothing to do with religion , you have an idea with NO evidence what so ever , science has  empirical evidence that contradicts all of the monotheistic beliefs , Judaism , Christianity and Islam all have miracles and a creation story that are incompatible with the evidence , the laws of nature are constant and evolutionary biology is at odds with those creation stories . The ignorant goat herders of the bronze age middle east had  myth and legend not based on evidence , like all cultures myth and legend it falls short in the 21st century and those that believe that bollocks have left the ability to think honestly and critically at the door when they entered their cult of choice or were psychologically tortured into believing when a child . Science and physics is an HONEST look for answers that explain the universe around us , you have already made your mind up and now have to fit the data to suit your poor choice of explanation .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=3020">50:20</a> I believe the &quot;spooky action&quot; misnomer is derived from the belief that photons are particles.  They&#39;re actually waves.  It&#39;s a wave of energy that connects the measured particles together and creates the constant of time. <br><br>It&#39;s a lot like the positive and negative convention is backwards in electronics. Your taught the opposite however and it&#39;s difficult for people to realise the blunder.  The only argument that photons are particles is within the photo electric principle.  But a closer look shows that the photon is absorbed by the electron.  And that&#39;s it.  No more photon. It&#39;s absorbed by the particle.  You can no longer say that the photon exists.  It&#39;s like, are you a cabbage because you eat cabbage.  No, it&#39;s cray cray.  Someone really needs to clean up science.
Thank you both so much, I am profoundly grateful for your generosity of spirit.
I&#39;m just saying, how are you going to generalize all people within a field of study?  More money doesn&#39;t mean more truth.

Listening to two very intelligent and articulate human beings is sheer joy!
I guess  wave functions and more than light speed collapse of a wave function is more like a property of quantum world  ,rather than a physical thing,its importance appears only with an observer ,all spins are similar for an electrone , it&#39;s electronness is equal for every spin   but for an observer electrone has a change with respect to it&#39;s spin.<br><br>So I think this instantaneous communication between the particles may not have a physical level of communication rather it could be a communication via properties, electrones exist but spins don&#39;t they are properties of a particle,so why can&#39;t some shared properties exist between them ,<br><br> cosmic speed limit is for existing things i believe, properties are observer dependent entities ,so can it have some wierd properties like collapse of a wave function from everywhere at same time?<br><br>Particles or quantum excitations are real and existing , but wave functions exist only as properties i guessü§î

They clearly listened attentively to each other, connected on ideas without talking over one another, and had a smooth, engaging back-and-forth flow. Their respectful yet vibrant exchange of perspectives was not only intellectually stimulating but also a lesson in having a thoughtful, enlightening dialogue. Inspiring.

I agree entirely this should be a model for all our conversations!
Something about the vacuum energy of space causes normal matter to fly apart rapidly (look at the very fast expansion velocity of thruster gas exhausted from rocket launches at dusk or dawn and from the rocket engine bell) makes it seem as though repulsion effects of molecular gas in a vacuum is the natural (dispersed) state of molecules/atoms/ions in a vacuum? Thus the reason the larger the rocket engine bell, the better (even a 1/2 mile wide if it were possible) to increase vectored thrust efficiency in a vacuum.

I went to school in the city in Indiana... I learned nothing there. I learned everything I should have learned at school by doing it myself. Including learning physics and mathematics. Still no Einstein with either but I do understand most of it.

I haven&#39;t even watched it yet, but I want more!
Dear everyone, I wish you peace inside your soul. We are all light and all connected, don‚Äôt be scare, all gonna be ok. Your futur gonna be fantastic because you are fantastic. Thank you so much for your reading.
The only thing dark about those days of the virus where how everybody was a sheep and listen to idiots telling us what to do
Why don&#39;t you give it a rest. Repeating this kind of rhetoric shows us who the sheep really are, sir. Do you have any thoughts of your own on this matter, or are you just going to keep repeating &quot;your sides&quot; &quot;party line&quot; in the comment section of YT videos for the rest of your life? Please, grow up. It&#39;ll be better for you, and those around you.
Penrose&#39;s CCC I think is much better and it has the far future and past being the same as you said.
Inflation wouldn&#39;t be possible in a time symmetric universe. So you would have to give that up if you want to believe in inflation.
Ah, I wish i had gotten in to ask both of my favorite theoretical physicists if the recalibration or recalculation of the observed and calculated age of the universe is inevitable as part of the refinement of the work of hard physical science? And not a sudden pulling of the rug from under? I tend to think overall the former and thankfully the conversation pretty much covers this overall!

wow what a treat my two favorite bedtime story tellers
Absolutely brilliant.  Fantastic that Dr. Greene provides the opportunity for the audience here to learn from the greatest minds of our generation.  I always watch, listen and learn.  Sean Carroll is one of my favorites and these two together are definitely a treat.  P.S. for Dr. Greene.  Lenny Susskind is one of my favorites too.  I am a nuclear and electrical engineer by profession and I took the time to watch Lenny teach QM on video from Stanford.  I really enjoy it when the two of you get together and I especially love his Feynman anecdotes.  Please do something again with him soonest.  I have watched everything you and Dr. Susskind have done on YouTube.
I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you, those guys are misleading ordinary individuals.

What&#39;s happening in the media lately?! They have nothing useful to add to science! Just promoting useless books (sophism). The issue revolves around preserving the world of illusions from which they make a living! But what about real science and the responsibility towards future generations?!

Stop pushing strings and inflation, they are not proven or observable or testable.
One  possible explanation that would explain the Asymmetry would be if  the  BB was result  of the collision between two pre-existing Universes one being comprised entirely of Normal matter and the other entirely Anti-Matter in which there were fewer Anti-Matter Particles Than there were in  the NM Universe. So since the The fact that there was less AM Particles in the AM Universe than there were NM Particles in the NM Universe would explain the Asymmetry we see today giving rise to the disappearance of the AM.

The Big Bang Theory - that 13.7 billion years ago there was nothing - then a big explosion happened, is the most ridiculous idea mankind has ever had. You don&#39;t need years of scientific training to see the stupidity of it. If there was NOTHING 13.75 billion years ago then there was nothing to explode. If there was an explosion 13.75 billion years ago then there was already something there to explode - hence there was something existing already, which means it couldn&#39;t be the beginning. The universe can only be infinite and eternal.

Greene is a genius at interviewing. All the right questions and not a single unnecessary word. What a goldmine of information Mather is. All of his answers were interesting and clearly expressed. What an exciting life he has been living.  Big puzzle: why not a Nobel prize for adaptive optics? I would never have guessed it would work.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwYHQ6YwwuY&amp;t=1200">20:00</a> not the only story that matches, but one of several stories and the reality is that you have measured the INFINITE UNIVERSE LIGHT coming from the event horizont ie where visible light is no longer constantly reaching us, but with some irratic appearence, AND THE MAP SHOWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATTER BEYOND THE VISIBLE/EVENT HORIZONT which you call the age of universe...UNIVERSE IS INFINITE IN MATTER, TIME AND SPACE
BLACK BODY CURVE showed you that you are measuring OTHER VERY FAR (THEREFORE NORMALLY INVISIBLE) STARS...since this curve shows the bonds between atoms (...we mostly call them covalent (two electron), but can be small amount and metalic or ionic (single electron) ones...) which are broken with some intensities at some temperatures and therefore producing frequencies AND THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS that are normal for OUR MATTER (obviously heated till evaporation and dissolution)
also no black holes were needed to form the Earth or light up the Sun, therefore there is no need for them and to glue starts into Galaxies...mass is just uncompensated nuclear positive charge and exists only 2 fundamental forces Electric and Magnetic that are interrelated and do not exist without each other
the more we learn only reveals how little we actually know.
All that was missing was a pint of cosmic beer for each of them. Such a relaxed conversation with a mound of interesting information. Both asking questions, both answering questions, just like friends. Great conversation Brian and John, keep up the great work.

. In the past, for various piddly reasons, Brian Green has not been my favorite scientist. In this interview however, he was fantastic. Many times, interviewers will ask long, 5 minute questions just to prove how smart they are. Here, whenever Brian Green &#39;interrupts&#39;, it is to clarify a point and then he says---  OK, this is where we were before, let&#39;s continue...
Is it possible that we&#39;re seeing so far back in spacetime that we&#39;re actually looking back at ourselves from behind? Maybe the universe is curved around on itself, and because of it&#39;s immense size that we can&#39;t perceive the curvature?  The way the Earth seems flat from the surface.

Awesome guest. It is becoming rarer and rarer for people to actually listen to questions and directly answer them. So many use any question as an excuse to just start talking about what they want. As usual Green asks the right questions  to get answers that intend to fill the gaps between what a knowledgeable audience know and what is realistically understandable.
It&#39;s become so rare that it&#39;s almost off-putting when someone doesn&#39;t try to dodge a question.

Entropy is a spectrum. Highest entropy is the final disorder which includes the infinite complexity and infinite symmetry. The transition between the two is the arrow of time. Infinite complexity is finite. If I may use the analogy of, when an unstoppable force (time) collides with immovable object (singularity), we observe to the best we can, a Big Bang (White Hole) erupting its content into time from infinite symmetry restarting the cycle towards infinite complexity.

Yeah time has come to the point we can&#39;t say if a comment is manmade or A.I. made.!!!üòÆ
Folks. I took the battery out of my watch and i stopped time. It would seem that time is not an unstoppable force.
@@patrickaycock3655 So you still had a battery in your cell phone, did you take a picture of your watch as evidence?
@@rezadaneshi sorry. I didnt have time.
@@patrickaycock3655 Augustus said ‚Äúpast no longer exist, future not yet exist and present takes no time at all. How can we say time exists‚Äù. Ironically the argument against your excuse of having no time, questions existence of time itself. You must be really proud of yourself Now!
Keep in mind that time in essence does not exist, it is just our common sense judgement to pinpoint exactly the location and duration of an object from point A to point B. We make sense of the world in discrete packets and concrete durations. But in fact, we are receding away from the Big Bang or point of creation as space expands which violates the arrow of time. Space spreads, time stretches and the cosmic rug unfolds while us humans are embedded in it like a slow motion movie üòÖ experiencing the entropic dance of life. Initial conditions of a low Entropy macrostate would be the Big Bang (high quality energy) and since then the Entropy has increased. When we reach the final disorder or highest Entropy of final destination, end of the journey or ‚Äútime‚Äù, all matter and energy could coalesce just like a black hole where gravity is too strong for anything to escape (not even light) and we could possibly slip into another Big Bang restarting the cycle again üòÖ Until then and by the time this happens a final theory of quantum gravity could somewhat solve the observer‚Äôs mystery for the deeply hidden realm üòèü§î
@@yasminegannam1989 I‚Äôm pretty much with you on everything you wrote but the fact that you‚Äôre equating end of time instead of switching direction on arrow of time to anti time which would be a contraction of spacetime, makes it part of the cycle of time anti time like orbit. Space is infinite but ultimate complexity of spacetime on space is finite. Some argue we never left the black hole, maybe because at ultimate symmetry, duality of matter doesn‚Äôt exist just like singularity. Singularity being infinite space infinitely packed with massless charge less dimension less particles, leaking particle anti-particle pairs into time right outside their event Horizon. Cyclical universe as you said, changes but we really don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs frame by frame or continuous with gradation, either way, what we call time, is a manmade unit that either deceives us entirely measuring the wrong thing or a coherent assumption hoping for quantum gravity. Ironically, if time is continuous and not quantifiable, there will be no gravitons and gravity remains a hybrid of when quantum particles play in time. We call it consciousness in discussions of human complexity, time introduces a kind of particle consciousness that create a field for all similar particles to behave in unison interacting with other particle fields. We take the ‚Äútime‚Äù out of equation when we collapse a moment to observe a particle in 3d as if it was a singularity. Intuitively, gravity is not behaving as if it is quantized.
@@rezadaneshi Wow! This seems like an AI generated response!! I mostly agree with what you said and I would like to simplify it to the best of my abilities üòÖ the passage of time (or flow of time) is the ultimate complexity of our Spacetime. As space (infinite) expands time (finite) slows contracting spacetime making it part of the cycle of non-real time, or orbit. On a larger boundless scale of an eternal cyclical universe, we perceive ‚Äútime‚Äù as frame by frame as in discrete packets. However, ‚Äútime‚Äù is actually non-real but continuous, or at least this is how we make sense of it (or more accurately as ‚Äòcyclical‚Äô). ‚ÄúTime‚Äù like entropy (can be created) &amp; exergy (useful potential work of the energy, can be destroyed) do not fit into the description of truly physical quantities, or quantized. At conserved quantities, mass and energy fit into the description of truly physical quantities. Everything is made of matter (more correctly, mass-energy). Hypothetically, the arrow of time is non real. The second law (inc. in Entropy or arrow of time) deals with quantities that are of a different kind of existence, a universe in which things come into existence out of nothing and go out of existence into nothing (like what you said, almost like a singularity). Strictly speaking, everything is reversible except the complexity of our own human consciousness. Constantly interfering and interacting in unison with other particle fields (irreversible). Also, gravity creates a curved Spacetime (a distorted time dilation). Intuitively speaking, time like gravity cannot be quantized. However, in the future we hope for a coherent assumption of quantum gravity. üòÖü§îüòä
@@yasminegannam1989 I can‚Äôt wait to hook up with a quantum computer then, where I can do unlimited calculations in zero time and become a singularity. And as such I‚Äôd say ü•∏ because someone‚Äôs watch records seconds and minutes and hours for her tasks, and because someone is a curious pattern seeking meaning making machine ü§î who studied Quantum physics üßê, where there is no time, therefore no gravity, why is she insisting on quantum gravity, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è must have become her religion!

This is the greatest discussion I&#39;ve seen with Greene. And literally the only one where I didn&#39;t feel like he was ahead of the conversation at all times. Martin Rees is truly an extraordinary mind. I have a feeling I&#39;ll be coming back to it periodically for a long time.

If the big bang were true, then why did all that mass and  energy expand instead of collapsing into a huge black hole?
.... also what about the galaxies that are older than the big bang that James Webb telescope is revealing... it&#39;s not &quot;filling in the gaps&quot;... it&#39;s dragging the whole big bang theory in to question.

Collision of branes JWST has  demonstrated a very big void  1.8 bilions  LY across.  Which can concure  with string tjheory, as branes
Rees is such a good listener.  Just watching his facial expressions as he&#39;s listening to Greene talk is a curiously pleasing experience.
Thank you. Still it seems ‚Ä¶ impossible to my human frame of reference, that the entire universe existed in something smaller than a child‚Äôs lunch box, and ‚Äòbanged‚Äô itsel into being.

The word evolved has become a word with no meaning or purpose to me. If any thing it has the meaning of stupidity. Science in my mind has made it so. How is it we see the same things in such a different way? This to me is mind boggling. So I say God Bless.
In terms of the implications of their work, scientists might have ethical responsibilities. But so then do politicians who decide how the products of discovery are (ab)used. Particularly in light of recent events in the Levant, how much trust can one have in political moral responsibility? Personally, the evidence convinces me the answer is, none.
Maybe &#39;electronic&#39; lifeforms (digital, analog mixed or other?) will develop from probes and self-replicating  exploratory devices launched by &#39;purely biological&#39; organisms. Particularly, as will be the case within 50 yrs, if the probes we send out have self-modifying (improving?) AIs running them. I wonder how such entities would come to understand their own origins? Would they manage to make the imaginative leap back to planetary surface origins? There&#39;s a movie franchise right there!

So we know how the car vehicle works but no idea where it started it&#39;s journey or where it&#39;s taking us, or the make of the vehicle, or the identity of the driver.
So much of the observable Universe is organized and comprehensible so the Big Bang is a intelligent phenomenal.

Listening to this excellent talk, I get the impression that we are living within a certain bandwidth of modulation on a spatial carrier that modulates waves with spacial frequencies varrying between stationary and the speed of light. At the lower limit, we can probe the inner perceived magic described by quantum mechanics. The shadow that this world casts until our modulated reality, cones in the form of a spread of identical particles, that may have connection with each other at a distance as perceived by us, but local in a reality that is outside of our bandwidth. <br><br>So, there is a universe on its own, captured like a hologram in identical particles that differ only with phase (like real holograms). <br><br>On the cosmic scales, the shadow of parallel reality presents itself as Big Bang, black holes, spacial accelerating expansion in scale (vaguely referred to as dark energy) and dark matter. I feel we may be able to connect these 3 real parallel universes and figure out what the extra spatial dimension looks like that expands our cosmic reality, mystify our sub-atomic reality as described by our quantum Physics gestimation model. <br><br>My question: is there research to probe individual electrons on information carried within about phase in relation to other individual electrons?  Similarly, is there study ongoing that searches fir links of how the hidden dimension at larger scales (speed c &lt; parallel reality &lt; c2.
We should look at new worlds that cast their shadow as described by QM √°nd that cast there other unique shadow on our reality as described by GR.<br><br>The unification of QM and GR goes via parallel universes, beyond our direct horizons. Fields are patterns of these realities.
The optics through which we look at the Universe are too polluted by hundreds of theories like Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity. Therefore, an experiment on cleaning optics is needed. For this I suggest:<br><br>¬†Postulate 1. Light is an ordered vibration of gravitational quanta. Postulate 2. The speed of light, regardless of the source, within the ‚Äúframework of the dominant gravitational field‚Äù ¬† This is determined experimentally using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope (based on Michelson&#39;s experiment 1881-2015). Using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope, the straight-line speed of vehicles can be measured.

@briangreene Do we know how fast the electron orbits the nucleus in atoms?
I think similar to the earth&#39;s orbit speed, so would be very fast from human perspective üòÇ
Hello Sir.. I was thinking that &#39;since Sun is one of the foci of the planetary orbits, maybe the other foci is occupied by antimatter of Sun&#39;.. Could it be possible?
I really think it‚Äôs a waste of time listening to this. All of it is conjecture. The bottom line is that you simply don‚Äôt know any of the answers and to say you do is a downright lie. You know nothing‚Ä¶you can prove nothing. I‚Äôm out.

You cannot prove the big bang. You can practice its doctrine; but, it&#39;s more about imagination than anything.<br>  The big bang is a theistic postulate without any support from physics. It requires an external force for the supernatural foundations to occur.

As to surveillance in the bioterror context, Lord Rees seems to be concentrating on the wrong subject. Not the individual say virologist cooking some deadly pathogen is the problem, but the military worldwide doing so is, in a plethora of labs funded by black budgets. Wuhan is almost everywhere. These days, WHO&#39;s power grab in the making exactly is the strategy to shift the whole health problem toward bioterror issues, enabling a much worse than Orwellian future...

Today&#39;s cosmologists seem all too reminiscent of the State of lsrael: their universe expands, but into what? They appear to believe that it can expand, without implying the existence of further, existing territory beyond its borders, about which they appear in denial.<br>The universe can change its nature but, by definition, cannot expand without a redefinition of the concept. Also like lsrael, their universe is materialistic, encompassing energy and matter but not the space into which it explodes.<br>For them, energy and matter are like an eye defining that which exists by what it can see or touch. There is no God to see beyond that, to see where it&#39;s all going...

Brian, thanks so much for producing these podcasts with such interesting and brilliant people - they really feel like &quot;Candles in the Dark&quot; in these times when so much seems to be going wrong and the future looks increasingly bleak . .
Wierd, was not in person this time.
I think in the future, computers will be so powerful, they will be able to work out the universe mathematically. With human experimental data fed to them as biofeedback. They TEACH us how the mechanisms of the universe work. They do the calculations, and break it down for us. Just as science communicators do to regular people.
Great .. here is the jew who hates Trump
I could literally listen to this stuff for days on end. Thank you both for the educational and insightful discussion.
And if you do,  you might realize how pointless the answers to these questions can be on many aspects... IF every question asked here was answered, ask yourself &quot;What difference would it make to you, me, or even humanity as a whole right NOW. <br>--<br>Would any answers to their questions fix humanity?  Would it fix the russian conflict? The palestine conflict? Inflation?  Hunger?  Absolutely NOT.
@@250txc I really shouldn&#39;t respond to this because it isn&#39;t worth the energy. The answers are interesting to me, and therefore are not pointless. Youtube isn&#39;t a forum for &quot;fixing humanity&quot;--it&#39;s simply a place to consume content based on personal interests. World conflicts are important but I don&#39;t spend my idle time thinking deeply about them.

How come Bri Green never talks about politics anymore? He used to be very vocal on his opinions of Trump.. Guess the child sniffer is his idea of a great president, so as not to warrant any criticism or even comment

Most unproductive &amp; useless thing to ever do is do research about universe. It‚Äôs just waste of all resources like time, money‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Exactly. Point of no return! Almost like a singularity. We are not able to achieve anything because we cant probe everything üòÖ the universe is ending anyways.. a Big Crunch followed by another Big Bang (hypothetical scenario but still has not been confirmed by science). But, how long do we have to wait for another Big Bang to happen with the right quantum fluctuations for life to emerge here on Earth? Experiencing the passage of time on Earth is very slow due to gravitational forces 13 billion years have passed since the first big bang üòÖ a lot of time has passed üòÖ but it is equivalent to just a couple of years in outer space . The experience of time is slow due to gravity. Gravity distorts our perception of space and time (distorted time dilation). As space expands time slows, however, a lot of time has passed since creation. Gravity distorts spacetime (curvature of space.

@@Alan_Berger He may just be a product of his time, a believer in the good of government, that it doesn&#39;t exceed the limits of it&#39;s given power unless given extraordinary reason to. Through that lens, it is easy to say that government should have the ability to see and hear all. I imagine he must have read 1984 with a grin and a slight chuckle here and there wondering with amusement how  things could ever get to such a state.

Another useless nonsensical thought that came to me last night.  So entropy of the universe since the BB or cosmic inflation, if there&#39;s no inflation nor expanding of the universe there&#39;s no entropy, right?<br>There may be some sort of mixing going on but it&#39;d move to an equivalent state anyways.  And that&#39;s it.  No sub-atomic particles transformed to quarks to protons, neutrons to atoms to molecules if no expansion of space, right?  There&#39;s. A limited matter and expanding space making the temp down thus they&#39;re being transformed to ... hence entropy.  If the expansion had stopped before CMB, everything would have stayed at a plasma state, no entropy, wouldn&#39;t have gone nowhere, right?   ? ? ?
They&#39;re pushing the idea of giving up privacy again, haven&#39;t we heard this before? It&#39;s pretty ridiculous, and it clearly shows that Greene and Rees don&#39;t really get how computation and innovation work when you restrict human behavior. Take Edward Snowden, for instance. Despite being under constant scrutiny, he managed to sneak out sensitive information.

I always thought if the Big Bang existed we would show the galaxies far way would be closer to where the point of explosion occurred, but what we have found seems to be a universe which was already expanded beyond where we are at the beginning of our ability to see galaxies.  So we came of with a new theory.  The main reason for this theory seems to be so we could keep the Big Bang theory. Now we theorize the expansion is increasing?  So there was a very fast expansion, then everything slowed so we could see what we see, then expansion is increasing again.  I don&#39;t think we need to throw away what we have done, but we need to refine our measurements and be open to a new theory if it fits all the hard points.
The bigbang happened everywhere in the universe, there is no center, there was no explosion... hypothetically speaking.
Yep, as the comment above said: the big bang didn‚Äôt occur at a single place. It occurred ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù. We know space is expanding, but it‚Äôs not expanding in one direction from a source to a destination (I suspect many people mistakenly view the known Universe as a sphere, with the big bang in the centre - this is actually mistaken). It‚Äôs more accurate to imagine the space between all objects expanding in all directions simultaneously. <br><br>Also, technically speaking, we only know that the early Universe was very hot and dense. At a certain point, known physics break down. The label we use to describe the point beyond is ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù. However, technically, we don‚Äôt know what the Universe‚Äôs initial conditions were. It may be, for example, that there was never a ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù in the way we intuitively understand it. It could be (as Penrose suggests), that the Universe periodically expands and then contracts and expands again - perhaps forever and ever. Also, some theories suggest that space and time themselves are emergent properties and are not fundamental to reality. <br><br>As humans, we experience the arrow of time. It is plausible that we are trapped by our experience of time and are unable to access its true nature. As a result, even positing a ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù of the Universe could be highly erroneous - it may be ‚Äúthe wrong question‚Äù, as some say.
When they discuss giving up privacy they implicitly assume that surveillance would be done by a benevolent authority. However, once you build systems that allow surveillance then there is no control on who would exploit that. Then, an adversary can use surveillance to find those who would make a bio weapon and encourage them to make them!
It isn&#39;t much different for me than the trust we put in our policing systems.  They are done &quot;by consent&quot; and are deeply flawed in practise.  The oversight of policing is woefully inadequate and the punishment for failure is,due to corruption of humanity, failing to correct the issues.  However, those policing failures are critical for the individuals involved, often fatal, but don&#39;t scale up to large populations, thankfully, yet.  That&#39;s not to be certain that the future of policing cannot be made, on purpose or accidentally, to a scale that endangers the majority or all of the populance.<br>Who watches the watcher is a long asked question and is, clearly, fundamental to a system as future pervasive as something like AI will almost certainly become.  Who, and how to control, manage and protect is vitally important.  Government oversight?  Well, that doesn&#39;t work on so many levels already with systems that are not all encompassing (re:policing as described).  Systems that monitor systems?  Chicken and egg situation, who manages, control and protects the systems that monitor the systems, ad naseum?<br><br>We can be hopeful, there is &quot;hope&quot; in &quot;hopeless&quot; afterall.  But it would be naive to believe that we, as flawed humans, have capabilities to control the future safety and security of AI, in particular, and other dangers, Bio weapons, etc.  Sure, we can give up our privacy for a guaranteed safety - I&#39;d be happy with that.  But who/what can provide that guarantee?  Sorry, got no answer, except to say I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY PRIVACY TO ANY SYSTEM THAT IS ADMINSTERED BY GOVERNMENT OR CORPORATION ( don&#39;t leave much, huh?)
I found his Before the Beginning ‚Äì Our Universe and Others&quot; and read it a long time ago.  It&#39;s good to see him still at it!
How do you establish connection between Big Bang and CMBR. Having a wrong premise some times one can make correct prediction.

Another great conversation between two accomplished scientists. This channel is so refreshing.
Needed more than ever these days.
Brian, what the hell was going on in the background at the beginning of the talk? It looks like a couple people walked onto a plank on a construction site, and through a few things over. They keep going away, and coming back.
First off, great conversation, as always. WSF is my favorite brain candy, nevertheless . . . Let the billionaires spend the hundreds of billions (trillions?) necessary for human space exploration? It sounds eminently reasonable at first blush. Sadly, the statement ignores the obvious; every billionaire is a failure of politics, policy, humane governance, &amp; imagination. If the trajectory of income inequality and climate change continues, we‚Äîa civil society that cares about the mass of the electron‚Äîwill die of social suicide long before Elon&#39;s grandkids are growing weed on Mars (Martian colonial life would be pretty monotonous). An increasingly desperate (&amp; well armed) citizenry will not be looking to science and the academy for answers; they will turn to demagogues, clerics, &amp; conspiracy mongers. &quot;We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of the few, but we can&#39;t have both&quot; Louis Brandeis. I kinda doubt that an American dictator (a Christian Ayatollah?) will want to spend much on theoretical physics. But please keep making wonderful videos.
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.  By denying the evidence that contradicts their cherished hypothesis, and the existence of the Intelligence behind it all.
Greene and Rees say that the hotter regions in the CMB indicate higher density, but don&#39;t explain why. I asked chatgpt. Their answer:  In regions of the early universe that were denser, there were more particles (like protons, electrons, and photons) present. This increased density meant that there were more interactions (like scattering) between particles, which led to slightly hotter temperatures. So, the hotter spots in the CMB map correspond to regions where there was a higher concentration of matter.
It&#39;s also why the he mentioned it informs the structure of the universe, the higher density areas correlate to cosmic strings, attractors of matter that form largest concentrations of matter we can identify.
Could the phrase, &quot;World without End&quot; from the English Book of Prayer allude to the idea that there is no end to the universe?
if the universe is 13.8bly in all directions, why are we not in the center of it all. And I believe we&#39;re not but why is it the same in all directions yet we&#39;re not in the center of it all.
Thank you for these valuable educational videos! They are treasures
Return that dirty Templeton money.
Great open minds discussion
there is light in every part of the sky, even in the dark part
Yes!  Pattern recognition is it all there is.  Pattern recognition is logic, science, philosophy, theology, is it all there is.<br>Heres the thing.  There&#39;re two realities.  One is Truth, the ultimate truthor reality.  The other is a practical realistic reality.  Truth, we can never be sure if or when we get it.  We may get to ir but never be for 100% sure.  That&#39;s because of our soliscism, consciousness in brain through 5 biological senses, everything can be a figment of your imagination (consciousness).  And so let&#39;s assume there&#39;s the real world out there, and we do sense it, experience it, the practical realistic reality.  Although ultimately it always comes down to solitudcism.  In science terms, it&#39;s a special relativity and quantum mechanics.üòä<br><br>Ok, so we see patterns.  We see patterns in patterns and patterns in patterns.  We try to figure out the order of patterns and their causalities, what causing what to make it a pattern.  And we apply them, follow them.  If we&#39;re right, we could figure out its outcomes.  We can plan it ahead.  We could plan the future following the patterns.  But at the end of the day we do have to make a choice.  To make a choice, we&#39;d have to evaluate available choices.  So how do we evaluate?  I think that&#39;s where our biological feelings come on.<br>There&#39;re two sort of feelings, physical feelings like pains when there&#39;s a cut or punched or burned or something.  And feelings of physical pleasure, sexual ones or scratching an itch or something.  And there&#39;re meta-physcal or phycological feelings like feeling happy, sad, sorrow, anger, fear, etc.  Or something between like feeling thirsty or hungry or tired or ...  I&#39;ve no idea how or what our brains work in those things, though.  But i think we see patterns, figure out the order of the patterns and try to understand their causalities, and we apply them and follow them to make a choice for our future actions.  Sonething like that, i think, maybe, maybe not.  Something my useless nonsensical wonderings.üòÇ
With the revelations about aliens, idk if the current ‚Äúminds‚Äù of today should be fueling the future. I mean they went head over  heels trying to ignore all these claims by top government officials over the years.
&quot;We might have to disconnect from our electronic devices.&quot; <br>I agree, I can easily imagine a future when our species ends up destroying all these devices. Out of privacy and peace of mind.
chatGPT: &quot;The mass of the electron is a fundamental constant known as the &quot;electron rest mass.&quot; It is one of the most important and well-known parameters in physics, particularly in atomic and quantum physics.<br><br>The electron rest mass is approximately:<br><br>9.109√ó10‚àí319.109√ó10‚àí31 kilograms (kg)<br><br>or equivalently,<br><br>0.510998950.51099895 mega-electronvolts (MeV/c¬≤) (where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, and MeV stands for mega-electronvolts, a common energy unit in particle physics).<br><br>This value represents the mass of a stationary electron and is a crucial part of various fundamental equations in physics, including Schr√∂dinger&#39;s equation for quantum mechanics and the relativistic energy-mass equivalence principle E=mc2E=mc2.&quot;
Enjoyed the conversation.
The style in which Dr. Greene interviews is amazing. He should do a Masterclass on that. Allowing the interviewee time to explain and postulate while simultaneously adding his own perspective and segueing into new topics makes it so smooth and an easy listening experience.
Great show guys.

As for dark matter I just watched a talk from Neil Turok at Perimeter that suggests dark matter may be right handed neutrinos. His idea also does away with inflation, is consistent with Lambda CDM, and has an interesting idea about the Big Bang singularity. At least seems to anyway.

Not even ‚Äònegative‚Äô charged particles. Try ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô. And think differently. Listen to the deeper intuition that postulates the existence of even non- existing.

It‚Äôs like it is with people- some people ‚Äògel‚Äô/ get along with some other people more readily than the rest, but all are supposed to coexist in the social universe. It‚Äôs the same at Cosmic and subatomic levels. ‚ÄòAs above, so below‚Äô is, really, ‚Äòas outside, so inside‚Äô. I‚Äôm not over- psychologising and I don‚Äôt think that the Cosmos was made in the human ape‚Äôs mind, as it predates it. That is, unless you dispense with ‚Äòtime‚Äô altogether which nobody can do.

Yes, indeed.

The suggestion by Rees to subject AI products to an FDA-like review process before they can be used commercially is literally insane, and at the same time, just incredibly naive. Hard to believe such an accomplished person can utter such nonsense.
What an amazing mind and presence Mr. Rees displays!!!!

I asked chatgpt how to predict the mass of the electron.

So what Mr Rees is the past and Mr Green the future? Stop this self-flatulating, ego rub and get on with something worth discussing.
We often talk about the ‚Äòearly universe‚Äô as if we still aren‚Äôt in it.  According to most accepted  cosmology  models the current Universe isn‚Äôt even one  octillionth of its eventual age or size. The Universe isn‚Äôt  big but absurdly small. The  odds of being at this stage  along the continuum is even more absurd.
I get what you&#39;re saying but that&#39;s not what he&#39;s saying... early relative to where we are now, so, no, we&#39;re not in the early universe.
Imagine the odds against this conversation. Enjoy the ride :)
On the A.I. discussion at roughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYVMulMNZMs&amp;t=2100">35:00</a>, it seems to me that we already at the point of not understanding how the A.I. models we have work (not completely completely), and we use those incompletely understood A.I. models to develop new, better and even more complex A.I. models.  Add to that, what we call &quot;A.I.&quot; is not actually intelligence yet.  They are just complicated algorithms.  Real artificial intelligence is likely coming and it will both help us answer questions we want answered and answer questions it comes up with on its own (and we may not even understand the questions these future intelligences are asking ).  We have to be prepared for that.  Someday the smartest and best educated of us will still be like chimpanzees staring at a machine that dispenses bananas.  We will only know the bananas are good, not how the machine is producing them.  The creations of our creations will be engaged in what, to us, will look like magic at that point.
Why would an intelligence that could view us simple chimpanzees happy with the bananas it dispenses to us, continue to dispense those bananas?  Presumably, if the chimps are some how required for the future success of the &quot;magic&quot; AI then it ensure that bananas are forever forth-coming, but that seems even more far-fetched than an intelligence that considers humans as chimnpanzees who need bananas regularly.  Magic-level AI would have dispensed with feeding humans bananas a long time ago, surely?

The biology of memory, when viewed through the lens of quantum biology and consciousness, opens up intriguing possibilities about how information is stored, processed, and recalled in the brain. At its core, memory relies on the complex interplay of neurons, synaptic connections, and biochemical processes. However, some researchers in the emerging field of quantum biology propose that quantum effects, such as superposition or entanglement, might play a role in cognitive functions like memory and consciousness. These theories suggest that quantum phenomena could contribute to the brain&#39;s ability to rapidly process and integrate vast amounts of information.<br>From this perspective, consciousness and memory might not simply arise from classical neural mechanisms but could be influenced by quantum processes at the micro level, potentially occurring in structures like microtubules within neurons. While this idea remains speculative and is still being explored, it challenges traditional views of the brain as a purely classical system and raises the possibility that memory and consciousness are deeply interconnected phenomena influenced by both biological and quantum processes. If true, this could offer a profound new understanding of how we experience and remember the world.
It‚Äôs been suggested that the typical American diet could be promoting protein buildup and plaques in the brain. Seems to me America suffers from 3 related dietary issues, obesity, the same dietary causes for obesity are also linked to Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia, and cancer. So it seems like a logical conclusion to say that that eating high carb diets with lots of trans and saturated fats is linked to obesity, Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia, and the bodies way of combating that with elevated igf2 can lead to the proliferation of many different cancers.. We know that elevated IGF2 levels are linked to colorectal, breast, prostate, lung cancer, and pediatric kidney cancer,. Sounds like America to me.  Can someone debunk me here? I would very much like to know if this is not possible.

Concerning the conference on memory by the scientist Cristina, I would have loved to hear her address the types of foods that helps motivate a healthy brain and healthy thinking. Much of the information given by her, I already read on my psychology books and in molecular biology processes. Maybe Prof. Brian could interview neurologists studying nutrition to enhance the memory and thinking experience. Nutrition that promotes the neurofactors, neurotransmitters production to strengthen the memory pathways on adults and seniors.
MEMORY FORMATION   AND RETRIEVAL <br>        The dentate gyrus which is a part of hippocampus itself, is where memory or   information is stored . It‚Äôs corresponding part can be considered a chip set or hard disk of your computer or chips in smart phones    Just as per theory of semiconductors  ,    in case of the ionic lattice of microtubules , in pyramidal cells of dentate gyrus .<br>          When an electron from covalent band jumps to conduction band , It  creates a hole behind it and overlaps each other , in turn it thus makes an energy gap of less than 1 MVs of electro motive force  .

lots about the mechanism of memory, but nothing about storage/indexing. I would like to have heard some discussion about the location of memories and whether there might be some redundancy built in. Also how our system can instantaneously recall, or assert that we don&#39;t know, a particular fact.

Very good questions. Because nervecells forms a net, which has limited capasity to change, the hormone system helps. But the nature of memory seems to be complex and unclear. It is more dynamic than structural fenomena. Both are needed. The attention to the Freudian unconsiousness was splendid.
My unusual memory triggers are odors and taste, but also the usual songs when I was growing up.

IGF2 is potentially dangerous.  It promotes tissue growth.  It is involved in menstruation and placental development.  Over-expression of IGF2 is implicated in colorectal cancer.

Imagine that your brain cells just like a group of synchronized birds, they are flying north, you are thinking quantum mechanics; they are flying south, you are playing piano; they are flying east, you are mowing the lawn; they are flying west, you are swimming in your pool, meanwhile some birds are still in north direction, you are partially still thinking about quantum mechanics!<br><br>All the sync systems are spontaneous process which obey the second law of thermodynamics, mathematical description may not solve the problem: ‚ÄúHow does order emerge out of chaos‚Äù.

All these sync systems obey the second law of thermodynamics, which entropy reached maximum. When brain cells are in sync, without any extra energy input, the sync will last as long as your life. Sync is energy conservative system which is spontaneous process as well as our memories, imagine some events happened in your childhood.<br>So, let it go! Sync yourself!

&quot;But there is also a close connexion between a coat and the nail on which it hangs, for, if the nail is pulled out, the coat falls to the ground.

No more are we entitled to conclude, because the physical fact is hung on to a cerebral state, that there is any parallelism between the two series psychical and physiological.&quot;<br><br>(Henri Bergson,  Matter and Memory)<br><br>&quot;A coat is solidary with the nail on which it hangs; it falls if the nail is removed; it sways if the nail is loose and shaken; it is torn or pierced if the nail is too pointed; it does not follow from all this that each detail of the nail corresponds to a detail of the coat, nor that the nail is the equivalent of the coat, still less that nail and coat are the same thing. So, too, the mind is undeniably attached to the brain, but from this it does not in the least follow that in the brain is pictured every detail of the mind, nor that the mind is a function of the brain. All that observation, experience, and consequently science, allows us to affirm is the existence of a certain relation between brain and the mind.&quot;<br><br>(Henri Bergson, Mind-Energy)

I already forgot the beginning of this conversation. üòÖ <br><br>The most important thing about memories is that they can change. For example, you can experience something traumatic, and in the short-term remember it in a way that causes trauma - bad thoughts and negative emotions - but then later you can heal that experience and remember it in a completely different way. Now your memory can create acceptance &amp; forgiveness, and a heightened self-awareness, wisdom and higher emotions. <br><br>Ultimately, the past is just a memory. It doesn&#39;t exist anymore. And so, we can learn how to transform the past into something positive, even if initially it was negative.
We can also remember the trauma and be cautious to prevent future traumas.
If you have any good overview reference about this kind of transformation of memories I would love the references.  Thank you in advance.

I  (also not a brain expert at all) agree that memory is necessary in order to be conscious but<br>also that there must be present in the brain at least one memory/thought with a particular content,<br>specifically, the memory/thought we refer to as &#39;the self&#39;,<br>since it is obvious that it is my self who is conscious.
I am wondering why Brian Green has not invited others along this scientist, so we have a dialogue from different perspectives..wish Oliver Sacks would still be alive to participate in this.. also the incredible Feldman Barrett and R Sapolsky etc..
Basically she told us that protein synthesis is important for long term memory and that a small peptide is involved in memory. With all my respect, but this is very few novelty in this session.
I memory act like pipe. WT type of fluid goes on it it take  that form.‚ù§

It was wonderful. Thank you Brian Green.
What would be your life without memories? It cannot exist. Let me switch around: What would be your death with memories? It cannot exist. We have to sacrifice or lose all memory in the process of dying. To paint an existence after death is therefore just an attempt to &quot;calm&quot; our mind, to make us think of something better than the loss of all memory. We are scared of that and &quot;believing&quot; helps to reduce that scare. To preach religious believe has simply two functions: 1. Make us feel better. 2. Control us. I won&#39;t go much into that 2nd reason or function. But the first one is really well meant and helpful and appreciated by many. The second - to me - is an abuse of our memory system for the personal advantage of the provider. When Moses brought the commandments his intention was to control by pointing to a higher power who gave him those tablets. To strengthen our &quot;believe system&quot; for his own advantage as the governing entity. We tend to forget bad experiences easier than good ones. But - not always. If an experience was strong and/or repeated no matter if it was good or bad - we will remember it often a lifetime.
You&#39;re lucky in that way.  Science says bad experiences are much more vividly remembered than good.  Of course peak experiences that are positive are not forgotten but for a lot of us memrories of bad experiences, especially if they were chronic and not a one-off often get worse, more exaggerated in the sense that the worst of the worst comes more into focus and the time elapsing allows us to recall those terrible memories more clearly because we have distance from them.  I found PTSD to get worse and worse over time and also the &quot;last straw&quot; effect can happen when there have been repeated bad memories where something, maybe not all that bad even, is literally the last straw to your nervous system.  That just happened to me -- someone was treating me a certain way and it was very disturbing but I knew I was not in danger but I emotionally freaked out like I would have at the most terrified moment in my memory and i literally felt the same way and relived it.  As for your issues with &quot;control&quot; most people definitely want to be controlled, they are followers that is why everyone is on the internet trying to be exacly like everyone else.  Most people complain -- teenagers mostly -- but they need supervision and structure and someone to tell them what to do and provide feedback throughout their lives.  It&#39;s normal.  Also Sapolsky&#39;s new book about Free Will is an interesting turn of thought -- do we have free will?  Can you locate it?  Is it in the same place the memories are stored (kidding around here).  PS I wish people would follow the ten commandments -- I don&#39;t care who had the idea those are good commandments to follow in life.  PPS a lot of people do lose their memories and it destroys one&#39;s sense of self agency -- any sort of mental malfunction will do that but otherwise they are exactly the same as they were with memories and sadly people often consider them vegetables because they are narcissistic and say &quot;he doesn&#39;t remember ME&quot; as if it&#39;s all about themselves.  No memory?  Great you can have a totally fresh new day every day without all the baggage!
This was amazing. For me, these conversations on how our brain works are the most fascinating.
Loved the questions. Ive had random recalls of things i havent thought of in decades. Especially when music is involved. As if the memory is sitting somewhere perfectly intact, and only needs a key to unlock. Very interesting subject
Thank you! üåàüåà
It is imaginable that memories are not purely internal, but interactive with physical (meaning non living, including plants!) environment, because I consider nature,  although lacks any purpose in itself, yet permits coordinating our own purpose with reference to the environment.
Hopefully Cristina Alberini  is also looking at the research done by Michael Levine and how memories are stored in electrical patterns and also genes in Planarian or flat worms. He also explores the notion of self of single and multicelluar organs/tissues and how it is connected to extents of shared electric field across gap junctions. And how cancer cells no longer identify with the &quot;self&#39; of the surrounding tissue and thus go into their own, ancient, pre-eukaryotic (reduced) self survival mode and attack the host body. Also the research by Manolis Kellis in this area is very interesting.<br><br>Just like memories are important to the survival, notion of self, they are also important to the notion of free will. Try to think if you can have free will without your memories.
At this moment in time I don&#39;t think that the &#39;experts&#39; really understand what they are doing.
&quot;Biological mechanisms&quot;; &quot;memory storage&quot; etc. all belong to the jargon of engineering. It seems as though biologists try to reverse engineer biological systems, assuming that ultimately they are just machines - a machine being any system whose state evolves according to some rule, possibly probabilistic; those things we humans are so good at making. However, in modern physics, where general covariance plays an indispensable role, there is no universal `evolution parameter&#39;, or time. Machines are therefore not native to our world, and a broader class of systems - non-machines? - should be considered. The phenomenon of memory in non-machines does not (necessarily) involve storage of information; empirically, memory is just an affinity between the behavior of a system at two distinct segments of its (extended) world-line. This even opens the possibility for `future memory&#39;...

For Brian: In search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust is a classic novel on memory
Thanks, I tried searching for the title but it seems it comes in five volumes !?!
Everyone three cheers for Brian Green, hip hip?  Hip hip?  Hip hip?
In a world where we are constantly stimulated to move on to the &quot;next thing&quot; (whatever that may be), this interview shows us how this interferes with our ability to learn, which is intrinsically linked to the ability to form lasting memories. We really need to slow down.
Right?? Wonder why the school system does not spread academic subjects like chemistry, mathematics, and physics over the week? Now days confused students come to class super confused without at least one day break from learning..<br>Let‚Äôs schedule math on Monday and Thursday and chemistry on Tue and Friday.. you get the idea!!
Ah they discovered how it happens but forgot due to chemical exposure? Years later ...
You&#39;ve got to be careful in those labs. Don&#39;t say you don&#39;t remember.
Dead end
When the video started, I had a Deja-vu.

Every memory is concurred with action , if you just read and don‚Äôt write that memory just evaporate out of your storage , like a words out of your mouth, without any thoughts. You can read human mind by their actions of their words. Science are concurred with experiments and of course most with results of experiments.
Epigenetics at work !! Memory recall = opening  up neurotransmitter channels for easier transmission/reception of nerve impulses.
In my opinion, the memory may be created by most critical things as:<br><br>Pay attention.<br>Trying.<br>Love to trying.<br><br>However, any condition may able to change those things in my opinion, like aging condition‚Ä¶<br><br>A football fan and a soccer fan always are talking and have a good understanding about their own favorite sport.
A lot of jumping apes!<br>Planet of apes is full of chaos!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYZnoe4ZNv4&amp;t=1170">19:30</a> that‚Äôs incorrect because they can‚Äôt differentiate between self concept and personal identity, even though personal identity is a kind of simulation of self concept but they are not the same regarding memory, but they share memory, for instance during dreams self concept uses short term memory too, but humans recognise dreams through consciousness type two (that‚Äôs why humans can remember some dreams).<br>During dream you use consciousness type two mot type one that you uses right now, it‚Äôs different but that‚Äôs why its name is consciousness type two ,‚Ä¶.etc
Humans can generate long term memory from first time too in specific situations.<br>Not only that! Many humans those who had heart transplant acquired long term memory!<br>they can‚Äôt understand the real differences between short and long term memories!<br>Long term memory is direct part of self concept itself while short term memory is shared.
Many people who are exposed the traumas, physically, psychological, drug addictions become apart of the spiritual realm. This is quantum entanglement.  When a person passes and part of the vessel is separated  the electric current when joined can have a particular or particular memory or feelings sensation.  Energy exist it can never be destroyed.  But when not in a vessel to contain the while energy . Which is the heart and the brain molecules separate so do energy that can&#39;t be seen with the human eye. Aka the void.
I, again, so naively ask.... Why Mr. Beast video has more views than this one.

I&#39;m devastated how our current Study and work culture or for general lifestyle for that matter, has completely disregarded the importance of Sleep.
Sleep is great to heal rge mind. But sometimes stressing the mind in away of over thinking almost daizing off like falling asleep into like a meditative mind helps us become clever<br> But daily meditation can do this without the negative effects
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYZnoe4ZNv4&amp;t=600">10:00</a> Regarding how much insects can process and remember, their current approach will never work!<br>For instance they can‚Äôt imagine the amount of memory that Mosquito can hold and process, let har watch insects carefully, they rely on processing huge amount of information (high level related to memory)!<br>Molecular approach can‚Äôt help them to figure out how memory works.
It‚Äôs possible to try to understand how so-called working memory works within the current limited accumulated scientific knowledge but it‚Äôs impossible to understand the process of how temporary memory becomes permanent or the relationship between both of them, that has to do with Limbic system which works similar to processing unit that includes memory, Limbic systems is far more complicated than they can imagine, Limbic system will keep impressing scientists even after thousands of years to come (no exaggeration at all).
Well actually it&#39;s imprinting of the brain and memories..Feeling they say don&#39;t matter but they do.  Negative let&#39;s say energy or person situations cause trauma. Stress causes cortisol release of negative feeling sometimes then we have negative effects of not bring acceptance. Neuroplasisty is the change also of the brain functions and changing the way our body processes stress and feeling. Changing memories we convert.
So positive vibrations are needed self worth self confidence changing your mind from the victimized state to the state of mind that you chose this life and you take and learn and become curious and you study to learn. Thus is nor only boost of confidence but changing the chemistry of the brain and the body.  It&#39;s hard work I think j I. Proof of this
In the field of Physics, they tend to not run into the problem of ethical concerns of human trials ... so fruit fly&#39;s, and other species are just what we were mainly bound with. There hasn&#39;t been a full on scale of human trials since the Holocaust, so that has been a major problem (especially since we can still find out our system tends to vary more than we thought previously ... between species). Our work, as in all other fields, has our obstacles which burden us on our adventures (some more so their own brains limitation on understanding the world through our Phaneron).
We don&#39;t need a holocaust.  Due to the science discovery and doctors, scientists, trials,fda , free samples, pharmaceutical, social security  numbers internet , quantum physics every thing in this world is what life is about. Literally!

How many more people must suffer ?
Increased diabetes or bad insulin makers that won&#39;t take responsibility
8 billion people with diabetes
Actually, 8 billion people is the total amount of people on the planet. Are you sure?
Your correct! 8 million.  I eas spread typing on a phone listening and blowing my own mind that I told her what she was going to say before she even said it. Making me prove my point.  That if I can find there flaws without college , why. Because I&#39;m getting messages from above.
So why isn&#39;t the insulin makers making this Public?
Not if your insulin
protein in th brain is taken out and the insulin stops the liver from making sugar starving the brain
All diabetic maker blaming drug reps and just the samples
Then fresh insulin gets out in and bottoms out
Did you know insulin kept below 32 degrees causes insulin not to work? And insulin above 86 degrees stops working then if you wear an insulin pump outside for over this time you need more insulin the insulin goes bad the doctors adjust it.
Insulin is a hormone and removing sugar from the brain causes gastroparesis. Peristalsis stop methane builds in the system causing too much CO2 causing anesthesia type effects
Oh ya Bruce Willis has asphasia from diabetes and pulling sugar off brain and possibly can be reversed with protein and sugar in the brain it was just released in Feb 2023

Useless grant eaters...
üòÇ
How about this armchair theory devoid of any math?.... At the singularity of a blackhole, both classical and quantum physics falls apart and the three dimensions of space &quot;shatter&quot; into 9 dimensions of space. What we know as &quot;point particles&quot; shatter into strings. So it&#39;s only at the center of blackholes (or the beginning of the Universe) that talking about a &quot;single theory&quot; makes any sense. That single theory is the entire landscape of string theories. None of them are &quot;the right one&quot;, because we are talking about a so-called &quot;singularity&quot;.

Isn&#39;t String Theory under a lot of stress right now?
To me~~~perhaps to other people also~~~it&#39;s a bit strange trying to unite QM with GR because it&#39;s like going from walking the globe straight to building an aircraft capable of global supersonic travel. <br><br>If it were me,  my first goal would be to move from studying homogenous subatomic particles to a heterogeneous mix. Then I&#39;d want to understand how you can get emergent behaviour ie, understand QM as a non-linear theory that can help see the quantum system of larger and larger scales of length. <br><br>I wonder why people are trying to unite a theory that is used to explain things on a cosmic scale, when understanding the quantum physics of simple chemistry reactions would be easier?
String theory, quantum gravity, and black holes not only push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe&#39;s fundamental nature but also open fascinating avenues in astrobiology and the broader cosmos. If the universe is holographic, as some interpretations of string theory suggest, it could revolutionize our understanding of life&#39;s origins and the distribution of intelligence across the cosmos. A holographic universe may imply that our perceived reality, including life and its evolutionary processes, is a projection of more fundamental information encoded on a distant boundary. This perspective challenges conventional biological models and invites us to rethink the potential for life in different environments, perhaps even in ways we currently cannot fathom.<br>From an astrobiological perspective, if our universe is indeed a hologram, how might this influence our search for extraterrestrial life and our understanding of what constitutes life? Could such a framework expand the types of environments or forms of existence we consider viable for life beyond Earth?

Saludos a todos, Cuando escucho las diferentes explicaciones dela teor√≠a de cuerda las comparo con el comportamiento que tiene la m√∫sica en nuestro entorno. Solo que al entender un poco m√°s veo que nuestra realidad mas bien es un tejido  de varias capas y de las cuales cada capa  est√° unida entre si por unos finos hilos a los que  los cientificos llaman cuerdas. Tal como es sacado de una peli de ciencia ficci√≥n. Formamos parte de una pel√≠cula Hologr√°fica muy avanzadas en donde nuestros cuerpos estan ataos a est√° sin embargo nuestra alma est√° fuera de esta. Dado esto. Dios existe, y est√° en un plano donde no lo podemos ver ya que est√° en dimensiones diferentes, o mejor dicho , est√° fuera de este libro de realidades universos paralelos

Thank you both Dr. Green and Dr Valmaldeseana for the wonderful discussion . Being  a non physics person I did not understand a lot of things disxussed but certainly stimulated my interest .May be further discussion will help me to understand string theory better .Please keep up the good work!
And I thought string theory was dead. Stupid me?
I would love to hear what Maldacena has to say on these topics
Brian Green stop repeating and rewinding the same $$$$ over and over again. Bring something new to the table. I forgot string theory hit the wall a long time ago.
Is crushing a piano with a hammer a masterpiece? ~yes, but only if you have a crush in your piano. And if that very piano loves you back you are suppose to be able to play the piece again. So that composition is like the cat in the box, it&#39;s a composition that is dead and alive at the same time.
When the sky can be infinite, than the soil we walk on also can be eternal. Like the combination of notes in a composition ore in mathematics. The music is not in the ink, but the understanding of it can be found there, and destiny is choosing the mirroring of it. Some laws in nature brings forth the tunes. But miracles brings up the heart. But for God, miracles are natural. And it is impossible to surprise Him. So being a human is like being a gift. Where the surprise is constant and cheered by God but not surprised by Him. We descover math and physics with our working invisible brain that we have a theory is inside our scull. Our thoughts.. Wait, who is thinking here? Maby it is the plank sized brain of this emoji üòä
Professor Greene compose music, by stretching my intuitive creativity past the speed of light inside 2 black holes at the same time insanity is locked down in a different universe than where our stars is observed.
Maybe unifying gravity and quantum mechanics is a bit nonsensical -- analagous to trying ro unify the interactions of quarks and the behavior of hurricanes. ... or, trying to unify the function of logic gates with the rules of Grand Theft Auto. üòä<br><br>In other words, the phenomena are not contradictory, but the levels are far apart.
Time is understood as a line from future, present to past but we understand time from the only place we know and that is the present. Future and past is seen in the minds eye where future and past is copy pasted by our knowledge of where we live and die everything we do is in the present. Time has 3 dimensions with each a set of laws because the universe is at its core a reality engine and the speed of light is the boundary between present and future state or 2 an 1 dimension wavefunction is futures state particle and the reason for wave collapse is not the measurement but past state mechanics realigning causality and chance to its everchanging definition so reality moves time in the moment.  (3 constants of temporal reality momentum and laws unique to itself and wave collapse is just a part of iets mechanics)
Juan Maldacena lives somewhere on the boundary of the Universe. My head is spinning.
I want that painting in the background. Anyone know the name of it?
They will keep going in circles till they dont include God in their calculations
Explain how to add him

That was interesting listening, thanks to both of you. A little frustrating in that when I hear talk about the inside of Black Holes, in the thinking that Gravity is a property of the energy interactions within the Higgs Field, gravity cannot exist inside Black Holes to any depth, and so there is no singularity. Gravity ends at the Higgs Field event horizon of a Black Hole at one end and at the Quark energy event horizon at the other. What it also says is that where energy is applied to a particle to accelerate it to near the speed of light, the Kinetic energy accumulated by the particle is visible as ‚Äúphantom‚Äù matter so where this matter can be ‚Äúcreated‚Äù, at the LHC for instance, a small LIGO module in close proximity to the Proton Beam should be able to detect an increase in Higgs Field energy as a Gravitaional Variation relative to the background Field Energy. Depending on the arrangement I think that the laser should exhibit a red shift as the protons in the beam approach the speed of light. In the so doing this might also demonstrate that Dark Matter might be explained as Phantom Matter, or variations in the Deep Space Gravitation due to variations in Higgs Field Energy Intensity Gradient.
A man and his twin brother say goodbye. The brother goes away to a distant star at a high percentage of the speed of light. The brother then returns. The story was always that the brother who ventured away and came back would age more slowly. However given that everything is relative, how does the universe choose? From each brother‚Äôs perspective the other seems to fly away at great speed and then return. Should they both not age at the same rate .?
Each twin traveled a different interval of 4D spacetime between the departure and reunion -- where and when they are both at the same location in spacetime. (They traveled a different distance in time basically.) That&#39;s always the answer to these so-called &quot;Twin Paradox&quot; scenarios. <br><br>In your question, <i>somebody</i> needs to turn around. (At least one twin, but this still works if both turn around after different amounts of time and distance.) If nobody turns around, the twins will drift apart forever and never meet again. Two straight lines can only intersect once in a flat manifold. You need a closed path, like a triangle. Two sides of a triangle are always longer than the third side. One of the twins travels along one side of the spacetime triangle, and the other twin travels along two sides of the spacetime triangle. These are different amounts of time and space, so each twin&#39;s own clock counts a different number of seconds between their departure and reunion. <br><br>To travel along two sides of a triangle, each side of this triangle represents an inertial reference frame if I didn&#39;t already mention this, that twin needs to change inertial reference frames. For a material object, a change in velocity is acceleration. There you go. One twin accelerated to turn around, and the other didn&#39;t. That breaks the symmetry. <br><br>You can also do this with triplets rather than twins, have everyone stay on inertial paths, and then each sibling synchronizes their clocks when they cross paths, and you will still get the same differences in the amount of elapsed time when comparing everyone&#39;s clocks to each other.
It intrigues me that you guys are having a problem with this. To my thinking the problem here is that Physicists have compartmentalised the science to the degree that you are not considering that the solution might be the manifestation of one principle driving force, not a multiplicity of separated individual phenomena. I‚Äôm old enough to remember when the number of ‚Äúelementary‚Äù particles was up to over 160, before that began to be whittled down. This is where you are at now in resolving the the interplay of energy and fields. The road block as I see it is that the compartmentalization is obscuring how the various parts interact, and there are several fundamental phenomena that are taken as ‚Äúgivens‚Äù rather than being integrally studied. The primary culprits here are the string theorists who have taken on resolving the energy dynamics of Protons and Neutrons as closed self contained systems. In the so doing they have completely missed the probability that, rather than matter being brick like building blocks, they are parcels of dynamic energy fighting against space, fighting against the Higgs Field which continuously reacts to contain matter energy in exquisite perpetual balance, and Gravity is the consequence of balance. Newton explained Gravity geometrically as the bending of space time, but there is and exact equivalent where the bending of Space Time is the Field energy intensity gradient of the static energy of the Higgs Field, and where that Gradient is the consequence of the containment of Matter Energy in Protons and Neutrons. All of the drama that makes the Universe work occurs in Atoms between the mean level of the electron probability zone and the boundary of the activity zone of the Quarks.<br>Give it a go, give your mind some freedom and see if you can resolve the known and fully measured Universe from this other perspective. <br>It‚Äôs all string theory but the boundaries and the space between them are completely different.
Juan and Brian, an empirical Real True Nature of Quantum Gravity theory will debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1.

FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1.

Question: what evidence we have for everything breaking down into 1-dimensional strings? and what evidence do we have for extra dimensions?<br><br>if we have none, then what validity does string theories have?
HOW CLOSE ARE WOLFRAM AND MALDESCENA
Just gotta say this: something I really like about Brian Greene is that even though he has opinions on the topic his interview subject is discussing and could easily BE the one being interviewed at any moment, he carefully doesn&#39;t interrupted his guests and lets them say what they have to say in their own way.   As obvious as it is that doing so is literally the POINT of interviewing guests, almost NO ONE who does it seems to be able to get out of the way.  The great Terry Gross of course is the absolute master of interviewing and Brian Greene is just like her in this respect.  Thanks Brian.
I find virtual particles appearing and affecting the electron magnetic moment amazing,   I find reality being based in 10 dimensions  less shocking. I find the analogy you gave in a different talk that the size of a string compared to an atom is similar to a size of a tree compared to the size of the universe ‚Ä¶ omg ‚Ä¶
Love Brian greene
Wouldn&#39;t it be stupid if the 5th dimension is just an objects vibrational oscillation.
Actual the Fifth Dimension was a soul band.
Congratulations hombres eruditos.
Refute the 1.0 experiment and I&#39;ll believe you everything you want
String Theory works in the Math Expressions - But is it ow the Universe Works? 95% of What-Makes-Up the Universe can&#39;t be explained OR in-fact even Measured. Until Physicists define what those Elements Are, How can they define THIS IOS HOPW IT WORKS - THIS IS HOW IT STARTED - If in fact it even Started At All -- what if it&#39;s always there, doing what it does, as with Life, An evolution of all kinds of Happenings. Find Out What Really Makes Up The &quot;Fabric Of Space&quot; --- actually measure it, and you&#39;ll get somewhere.
Dear professor Greene, how does a string maintain the same vibration indefinitely without becoming a different string? <br><br>What determine how it will vibrate?
Very boring, the interview is high jacked by the interviewer, we can NOT hear what the invite have to say which is very interesting,<br>It‚Äôs a extremely annoying.

Saoirse Corrigan DIED in a car accident in Ireland due to drugs
Would &quot;quantum entanglement&quot; be banned in the future? By mere words alone, it will lead to a Universe of entangled mess. :P
HEY Dr. Bryan Green I follow you a lot. Here I have heard you saying as a physics major in your first degree the instructirs did not mention quantum entanglement. How about the EPR was it inclusive in the curriclum back then?
The real world is a world of abstractions.<br>Abstractions  -&gt;can create matter.
I have been binge-watching your videos and I have been learning so much. I have a rather trivial question: what does the artwork behind Prof. Greene represent? Thank you for bringing knowledge to the masses.
The difficulty of combining QM and Gravity is that they combine in the First Cause Causal choice matrix.  Energy/mass in spacetime is shape not force.  Your problem is the shape of mass/energy in space time is dependent on future choices made.  The problem your having understanding the concepts of Relativity and QM and so chasing a sensible matrix of QM with Gravity is your not understanding the only force being applied is in the First Cause Causal choice matrix and QM and Relativity are shape matrix not force matrix.<br><br>You might find matrix formulations to more accurately represent the shapes, but you can&#39;t get there abandoning Orientation around First cause causal choice which includes you as a conscious actor as genesis of force.<br><br>The mathematical unification of QM and Relativity is in the testing of Choice as a force of creation.  We get this simply by noting the matrix describing first cause choice can be Relative or Newtonian if choice isn&#39;t a force of creation.  The matrix of physics must be a probability density if choice is a cause.  This is tested on both sides with overwhelming evidence.<br><br>QM is a matrix that shows all information at origin, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent Origin.  Whatever formula&#39;s you use this is your limit.  Non local/ Local description of action is just poor phrasing.<br><br>You understand QM and Relativity - You don&#39;t like that it doesn&#39;t mathematically combine so say you don&#39;t understand what&#39;s causing it.
Black holes were even awarded a Nobel Prize, but not everyone believed it. Question from Doctor of Sciences A.S. Chirtsov astrophysicist - ‚ÄúWhy do we think that what is observed and refers to a black hole is really a black hole?‚Äù Let&#39;s go back to the roots.<br>The so-called ‚ÄúSchwarzschild‚Äù solution is not due to Karl Schwarzschild at all - <br>&quot;On the Gravitational Field of a Mass Point according to Einstein‚Äôs Theory&quot;. <br>Abstract - &quot;Translation by S.

one thing you most know they donot have a character they only funtion by propositions therefore they dont exist their brain is bi=cameral state obligated to function on the opposite dirrections for the agenda that it is already irradiated &quot; I will redeemered all man no soul will be lost&quot; the portfolio is already out date by this statement   one the Un entanglement necessary for the real real free quantum... eradication of nukes is the only intermediately for nuclear is the fuel...in the holy name of majestic son of god jesus amen.  the leaders of this world coming together for their childrens future or the immortality bio- not humans drones as control freak.

Poor Ole Albert...always conflicted.
Hey Brian. If entropy of a black hole is determined by its surface area and not its volume then it sounds to me that space/time is indeed &quot;flat&quot; (2D). Therefore using entanglement (photon spin), there is nothing stopping us from shooting photon through the event horizon and &quot;reading&quot; what is inside when the corresponding photon (our side) changes after some event inside the event horizon.
No idea what they are talking about but I like it. Show the maths ‚ù§üôÉ
Can we send Elon Musk into a black hole to check out some of the Theory on the ideas about inside a black hole please
I do not think you understand what a Schwartzchild radius is. If he passed the event horizon (and was not ripped into shreds by gravity differentials) then his signals could not be sent back to us.
The Big Bang Theory seemed to infer String Theory busted flush and whats his name was upset he was wasting his life. I hope that program wasn&#39;t misleading üò¢
If we are holograms, we are a projection of the many fields of quantum mechanics.
I have an enormous respect to Dr Green, though it may be underestimated that there is non-native English-speaking audience. Frequent interruptions and self-reflecting suggestive questions distract me heavily. Being a medical doctor not a physicist these presentations fulfill my curiosity. Would it be possible to let guests present their opinions a little more uninterrupted and free flowing?
Hello everyone, i dont want to show off but , I&#39;m 11 and very interested in learning theories describing our universe so thankyou for this discussion .
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNNXia9IrZs&amp;t=1250">20:50</a> Juan says: &quot;It might be the world is not quantum mechanical at those (Planck) scales&quot;. Doesn&#39;t that arose doubt that string theory has wrong (or uncertain) starting point when it tries to quantice the near Planck scale strings using QM?
Thank you both!
I think it is fair to say that the smaller we go, the more complex the Universe is, and this phenomenon is relative across the board. I would suggest that the puzzle is infinitely long. If String Theory is the only mathematically possible explanation, these idea&#39;s should be pushed to exhaustion, or until someone develops a radicaly better theory. As it stands the scientific explanations are incomplete, and unsatisfactory, which leaves more space in the human mind to seek for alternatives.There is a balance and a breaking point but we&#39;re not there yet, therefore this cannot be deemed as unproductive time spent. Keep up the good work!
String theory is math. It is certainly interesting. But it doesn&#39;t predict anything testable, nor does it necercerily describe anything in reality. It baffles me how obsessed ppl are with this compared to models that we can observe desccribes reality like MOND which nobody seems to be able to explain why works. Explain that, Also explain how and why reality violates bell&#39;s inequality. Thank you if you read and respond to this
Phyisists keep saying spacetime but i was sold that time is just illusions. Why is time ivolved here...
Where are swizis? give Brian Nobel prize at least for his services!
I like Brian Greene, I do. However, the best part of this watch was the fact that string theorists are slowly going on the back foot, defensive. 40 years and not a single prediction. All the great leaps forwards had instant or rapid applications. How much longer will this be the focus? I&#39;m not saying bin it. I&#39;m just saying maybe it&#39;s time to start at the basics again ‚ù§

I liked Brian,s comment that juan Maldacena was diplomatic about loop quantum gravity
Thank you for this video discussion and your position. We need to continue to push the frontier of knowledge further.
Thank you very much for the great Video
if you like a voice who is more critical and not that focused on speculations, go ahead and listen to sabine hossenfelder. I&#39;m curious too and I like to listen to the ideas of string theory and multiverses but fact is, these ideas aren&#39;t reality and there&#39;s no actual evidence that it becomes real. Mr Green just passed over the actual current facts to easy. As Sabine mentioned if you believe in multiverses you could also belive in god. There is no evidence for both of them.
Information is loaded into the void...planet - 3 -2-1 Then the measurement ..observer -planet 3-2-1 iobserver.. The information is larger than the radius and traps the natter
Consciousness pairs with its matter and constantly passes through it. Till unpaired and it shoots off to infinity ..the multiverse
Everything is a wave till you touch it .superposition in the initial condition...oxymorons do not collapse them selves
String theory is a phenomenal failure, only morons still believe it will lead to anything
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNNXia9IrZs&amp;t=2883">48:03</a> - This is juicy. It sounds like some of the branes and fields persist in transmitting information fwd / bwk in time, and via entanglement (location).
why the &quot;fabric&quot; of Spacetime cant be that missing part of that &quot;Quantum Gravity&quot;? What of the &quot;fabric&quot; of Spacetime is made up, that it can be streched, what material? Cant that &quot;material&quot; be quantised all of sudden?
Maybe the other dimension that we need in quantum phisics √Æs the consciousness that √Æs aware of matter and subatomic particles,our own consciousness.
Funny how my first science book was The Elegant Universe lol so I actually learned string theory and quantum before newton üòÇ
Technically, you learned it after him. You might have learned it at an earlier age, but without time travel you did not learn it before him.
this discussion feels like a response to all the hate mail string theory has been getting lately haha
Nima has it. The end.
Roger is out there  in a good way
My word what a bunch  of aholes in the comments section. Why cant people be respectful to each other? Just because you hide behind a fake name doesnt give you any right to be so rude to each other. Ill just watch this excellent program and ignore the aholes from now on. I encourage others to do the same.
Well said. But that&#39;s the price of anonymity.
String theory is a failed concept.
What if the higher dimensions are bigger then our 3 dimensions and we live in the projection or shadow of these higher dimensions. As in the way we can see the 3d shadow or a hypercube in these 3 dimensions.
Sounded with Mr. Green was picking Mr. Maldacena brain on subjects of Mr. Green concern...
Consciousness is the origin of Space and time. Similarly consciousness is the origin of quantum mechanics.

Well, in that &quot;holographic&quot; idea, the surface of your hypothetical iso-hypersphere (you hypothesize it being /on/ the edge of the universe, or, at least, very far) is defined as an isosurface, equidistant from your center by the application of the laws /formulas, to be more precise/ of relativistic gravity, so, of course, being an isosurface (hyper or not) it &quot;negates&quot; the gravity, drops it, it&#39;s &quot;gravity neutral&quot;, because you define it that way, so if you project on it what&#39;s inside of it, it will be &quot;gravity-less&quot; by your definition. If you use /formulas of/ relativistic gravity as a projection function on an isosurface, then you /by definition/ end up with a projection of everything but the gravity (and I have a feeling you may not even need to put it as far away as the edge of the universe /which probably does not exist/).<br>And please don&#39;t get me wrong, as IMHO String Theory is an amazing theory.<br><br>P.S. Actually, if you take my words the other way - if/as you define a zero-gravity isosurface, then, if I am correct, it should prove that your projection on it with relativistic math used as a projection function will eliminate gravity, keeping everything else /in tact/.

Hello from Kazakhstan. We can create an educational and practical device and practically master Einstein‚Äôs theories of relativity or obtain, for example, new physics: Postulate 1. Light is an ordered vibration of gravitational quanta. Postulate 2. The gravitational field controls the frequency and speed of light in a vacuum.<br><br>¬†This is determined experimentally using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope (based on Michelson&#39;s experiment 1881-2015). Using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope, the straight-line speed of vehicles can be measured.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† There is a company in China that makes (fiber optic angular velocity meter) they will be able to create a hybrid device. Please, can you come to an agreement with them? I guarantee payment at cost on my part

No, we are not holograms and I am sorry, but multiverses don&#39;t help at all. What is the role of passing of time in those (time-independent) modells?
firstly, recent research has shown that Einstein‚Äôs theories of relativity hold up when tested against the gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. this is an exciting development in the field of astrophysics and could lead to new discoveries about the nature of black holes and the universes..<br>secondly, the time it takes for humans to accept new ideas can vary widely depending on the idea and the context in which it is presented. some ideas are quickly embraced by society, while others as E.V. take generations to gain widespread acceptance. this is often due to factors such as cultural norms, political climate, and the availability of information. however, it‚Äôs important to remember that progress is not always linear, and that even ideas that were once considered radical can eventually become mainstream...
Juan Maldacena is generally considered by most physicists as 21st century Einstein. Besides his ADS/CFT duality theory, he displays a brave insight into reality, comparable to Einstein&#39;s &#39;equivalence principle&#39; or matter energy transformation E=mc^2, with a conjecture that has made him famous, in which he bravely declares the whole universe is a QC function, but admits we are far from proving it and predicts 30 years before we reach it. There are many ways we can reach it, he predicts string theory is one of them, SUSY is another, but the one that promises success is known as &#39;infinite axiom algorithm&#39; of error correcting QC function. Mathematician Penrose explains infinite dimensional Hilbert space can provide the coherent quantum theory (still eludes us) to provide fine tuned particles leading to life and consciousness (Hameroff&#39;s microtubules at room temperature) as a candidate. And Leonard Susskind&#39;s finite gate quantum circuit is another.<br>Going back to Maldacena&#39;s QC function a 7000 (??) qubit, error correcting system residing on the holographic 2-D surface of a gigantic BH, theoretically maybe the answer to life and consciousness, but the algorithm may keep us waiting for not 30 years but eternity before we learn it is a divine design. At least we got the mathematics right (!!!???).
Less interruption would do nicely. This way Dr. Maldacena, would have a better chance to present his thoughts.
Gotta stay on track its not like that
There is 7 universes its mentioned in quran the unification of gravity and quantum leads to sheet of paper with informaton on it its called &quot;kitab&quot; in arabic
I did some String theory then dropped out, I wasn&#39;t sure it would answer anything in my lifetime.
The fundamental flaw is that they use one dimensional strings.<br><br>If you switch it up so the open and closed strings have a simple cylindrical thickness that is constant with a surface that is very slightly textured such that the bumps and troughs on opposite sides of the cylinder cancel each other out but the location of these bumps and troughs along a length or around a hoop is free to encode information by being an irregular textural perturbation. As a <i>Theory of Everything</i> this provides a unification of <i>Quantum Field Theory</i> and <i>General Relativity</i> without recourse to <i>Calabi-Yau</i> manifolds and getting bogged down in the Swampland of 10‚Åµ‚Å∞‚Å∞ possible solutions, as it is based on a universe with one fewer dimension, thereby limiting the number of solutions, and then one is designated a non-relativisitic quantised time dimension which can be thought of as a tick of a simulation which happens regardless of singularity conditions within the pair of four dimensional universes it governs: one west coast convention [+ ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì] the other east coast convention [‚Äì + + +] being the universe we are familiar with. Both have increasing entropy but originate from opposing ends. This T-symmetry, joins S-symmetry and P-symmetry and C-symmetry for a fully symmetric cosmological starting point.<br><br>The math for this is trivial and can be summarised as follows:<br><br>		 Z‚Å∂‚Å∑¬π‚Å∞‚Å∏‚Å∏‚Å∂‚Å¥¬∑‚Å∂‚Å∑¬π‚Å∞‚Å∏‚Å∏‚Å∂‚Å¥	U(67108864, 67108864) structure group of Weyl spinors‚Ä†<br>		 ‚á°‚Üì œÄ‚ÇÇ<br>		 Y¬≤‚Å∑¬∑¬≤‚Å∑			the 54-dimensional Ehresmannian manifold &quot;behind the scenes&quot;<br>		i‚á°‚Üì œÄ‚ÇÅ<br>		 X¬π¬∑¬≥				our 4-dimensional psuedo-Riemannian spacetime, East Coast [- + + +]<br>		 ‚á°<br>		 T				the 1-dimension of non-relativistic quantised virtual simulation clock time <br>		 ‚á£<br>		 P¬π¬∑¬≥				our 4-dimensional psuedo-Riemannian spacetime, West Coast [+ - - -]<br>		!‚á£‚Üë œÄ‚ÇÅ<br>		 O¬≤‚Å∑¬∑¬≤‚Å∑			the 54-dimensional Ehresmannian manifold &quot;behind the scenes&quot;<br>		 ‚á£‚Üë œÄ‚ÇÇ<br>		 N‚Å∂‚Å∑¬π‚Å∞‚Å∏‚Å∏‚Å∂‚Å¥¬∑‚Å∂‚Å∑¬π‚Å∞‚Å∏‚Å∏‚Å∂‚Å¥	U(67108864, 67108864) structure group of Weyl spinors‚Ä†<br><br>		 ‚Ä†decomposed from U(134217728, ‚ÑÇ) Dirac spinor<br>		 such that U(c, ‚ÑÇ) where c = 2¬≤‚Å∑ where 27 = ‚åä54 / 2‚åã<br><br>		 where H¬π¬∑¬≥* x V¬≤‚Å∂¬∑¬≤‚Å¥ ‚Üí C(Y)¬≤‚Å∑¬∑¬≤‚Å∑ or Spin(1, 3) x Spin(26, 24) ‚Üí Spin(27, 27)<br><br>You will need to view this diagram in a desktop web browser so that none of the lines undergo word wrap.<br><br>Here, the complexified Spin group with 54 implicit dimensions is based off the cardinality of the unrestricted set of dimensional measures of the 9 dimensions, where P-symmetry can be obtained via a non-chiral theory provided that m = 4k + 2 where k is a Natural number, as a necessary requirement for Complexification:<br><br>		 Z·µò¬∑·∂ú		U(u, ‚ÑÇ) where u is the structure group given by the formula U(u, ‚ÑÇ) where u = 2‚Åø and n = ‚åäm / 2‚åã<br>		 ‚á°<br>		 Y·µê¬∑·∂ú		Spin(m, ‚ÑÇ) where m is the complexified cardinality of the unrestricted set of dimensional measures of X·µà given by m = ‚åä(d¬≤ + 3d) / 2‚åã ‚äó ‚ÑÇ<br>		 ‚á°<br>		 X·µà			this d dimensional surface is based on geometry defined by Bernard Reimann where d is a Natural number<br><br>Obviously, this is a larger structure group than we need for observed phenomena, but that just implies that there are more phenomena which have not yet been observed. Given that we infer the existence of Dark Matter yet have not found it experimentally at the LHC or the same in regards to Supersymmetric superpartner &#39;particles&#39; like the selectron having a large but finite group is no bad thing. If it were infinite it would seem like a cop out. Minimally we can recover what little we phenomenologically know, i.e. our current version of <i>The Standard Model</i> by taking the subset Spin(6, 4) which is included within Spin(26, 24) given that:<br><br>		 Spin(1, 3) x Spin(6, 4) ‚Üí Spin(7, 7)<br><br>it can also be shown that Spin(6, 4) includes the <i>Grand Unified Theory</i> developed by Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam:<br><br>		 Spin(6, 4) ‚âÖ SU(4) x ( SU(2)  ‚Äé ‚Äéx ‚Äé ‚Äé SU(2) ‚Äé‚Äé)<br>		 		 		  	 ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé·¥∏	 ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé·¥ø<br><br>As you can see this is non-chiral, and this undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking to choose an apparent asymmetry of &#39;particles&#39; with left handed spin in the context of the Weak interaction within our spacetime X¬π¬∑¬≥<br><br>		 SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)<br><br>These implicit dimensions are smuggled in using imaginary numbers (specifically the normed division algebras, which exclude the Sedenions and Trigintaduonions as it is not useful to throw away multiplicative normedness). Ordinary spacetime uses the real numbers within <i>General Relativity,</i> however the requirement to include &#39;particles&#39; with right handed spin means we need a Spin(54, ‚ÑÇ) theory which has a non-compact Lorentz group L = Sl(2, ‚ÑÇ) included within Spin(1, 3) as that is the double cover of SO(1, 3). The math for this is outside the scope of a YouTube comment so I refer to the answers to this question on physics stackexchange:<br><br>		 <i>What&#39;s the relationship between SL(2, ‚ÑÇ), SU(2) x SU(2) and SO(1, 3)?</i><br><br>so now as a result of that we have recovered spacetime from the infinite meta mathematical multiverse, although there is one remaining snag: why 54? This shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as being the magic number needed to get the math to work, so although it remains an open question it is probably something to do with knots. Edward Witten took <i>String Theory</i> in the wrong direction with his <i>M-theory.</i> This can now be seen in retrospect as a diplomatic move to bring all the five different flavours of <i>String Theory</i> under a single multiversal umbrella by adding an 11th dimension. This can now be seen to be a mistake as he overlooked the huge clue that <i>Type IIB string theory</i> is the only flavour which has <i>S-duality</i> with itself. This factoid might not be that curious were it not true that this was the reason why it connected nine dimensional D9-branes which are well suited to this model (D1 ‚Äòstrings‚Äô are insufficient and D11 branes excessive). <i>Type IIB string theory</i> connects through the <i>Grand Unification of Mathematics</i> which is the <i>Langlands Program</i> and passes through <i>K-theory</i> and <i>Modular Forms</i> (used by Sir Andrew Wiles to prove <i>Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem</i> ), into a connection with <i>Knot Theory</i> which Witten has also done work on. Unfortunately, he seems to have gotten distracted by the potential benefits of knots as a representation which can undergo surgery, rather than have the intuition that the Lorentzian (1, 3) split-signature metric is the only combination of temporal and spatial dimensions in which it is possible to tie a persistent knot. It isn‚Äôt possible in a (1, 2) ‚ÄúFlatland‚Äù, nor is it possible in a (1, 4) ‚Äòuniverse‚Äô as there is an adjacent hyperspace that allows a ‚Äòstrand‚Äô to slip past its bonds, in the (2, 3) case you may encounter an adjacent dimension whose parallel universe has a west coast convention and consequently the knot can go into this and reverse all of the steps by which it was knotted and appear to unravel itself as knowledge of how to do so is stored within the history of how the ‚Äòstrands‚Äô came to be knotted in the first place.<br><br>There is too much of a coincidence that this mathematical curiosity involving persistence operates only within our X¬π¬∑¬≥ spacetime, which when paired with P¬π¬∑¬≥ and quantised T you get the nine dimensions which grow the maximum set of dimensional measures needed to chart them as the Ehresmannian manifold which is initially based on Spin(54, ‚ÑÇ) and as there is no other direct route from (1, 3) to any other flavour of <i>String Theory</i> it strongly implies that those other 4 flavours describe mathematics and only <i>Type IIB</i> has any relevance to physics. That said we still have a problem of selection, and usually Brian Greene or Sean Caroll will hand wave this away by saying all variants exist in a physical multiverse. This is unsatisfactory as it means that there are an infinite number of versions of you, so that none of your achievements have significance as other versions may be failing elsewhere. We need to be the protagonist in our own story, or at least adopt some other <i>Weltanschauung</i> which does not undermine us existentially.
We&#39;re still on string theory?
It would become enlightening to discover das &quot;String Hypothesis&quot; ist true some near future...To prove &quot;Quantum [Gravity]&quot; truly exist or if it ist Electrical Charge in nature...und to possibly observe inside a black hole at least once, though I not think Humanity will ever truly know what we have labeled to be a black hole, as well I have much doubt Humanity will ever innovate relevant technology to send any spacecraft to such distance space.  Even if Humanity can exist for another billion years colonizing our Solar System for required resources?  It ist a probability that Humanity will never have ability to trek farther than our own Solar System.<br>  It ist quite possible Humanity ist apart of das largest Petri-dish experiment ever conceived by an almost infinitely larger entity watching und studying us through their microscopes.  I much hope they are not clumsy entities?   :-)<br>   Auf Wiedersehen

I&#39;m with you! These World Science Festival videos are educational and many are exciting to learn from. You do not have to have the &quot;mathematical formalism&quot; to learn from this particular video. That&#39;s the point.
@@EdruezziHow quaint of you, or is it simply pure narcissism?.
Don&#39;t your equations point towards hollow interiors for block holes when it comes to spacetime? The overall schematic picture is space-time gets thinner and thinner as you approach a black hole event horizon, and the entropy depends ONLY on the quantity of the surface for that particular reason. So, the event horizon is equivalent to a geometry defined as a &#39;surface tension of spacetime blocks&#39;. Then what is gravity? It is an emergent phenomenon of a density gradient change of spacetime building blocks. If all these &#39;ifs&#39; hold true, then there is no such a thing as &#39;crossing an event horizon into the interior&#39;. A thing falls into a black hole just to be retained as information at the surface, or if a part of it is to make it through instantaneously on the other side of the EH sphere.
Glad to see Holographic Universe Theory getting some side-ways mentions.
For someone whose native language is not English, it‚Äôs almost unbearable listen to Maldacena speaking English. Sorry, just saying.

Entanglement is a necessity to monitor and maintain uniformity across the expanding universe, a homeostasis mechanism in a delta universe.  A simple, as yet incomprehensible, instantaneous response system without which the universe as we know it would probably not exist???

you keep talking about shorter distances and LHC but at shorter distances the velocity would be so slow (since time is fixed) you could actually sit there and observe a collision of the short distance results with the particle chamber wall element, no?
Great talk. Thank you
Great show but the current theoretical physics is a house of cards.
This conversation was certainly stimulating at a personal level but they seemed oblivious to what is happening elsewhere. Its pretty abstract but at least acknowledged the effects of COVID to these type broadcasts in previous episodes was a factor. Not so much right now with the world turned upside-down concerning the Israel-Hamas turmoil. Must be the &quot;multiverse effect&quot; that Brian Greene and thier hosts have no idea about. What planet do they live on? Would like to go there - things are getting heated up here, right now.<br><br>Nice show.
Fun to watch Brian squirm/reach a bit. I like Juan&#39;s attitude: He&#39;s like, &quot;Whatever.&quot;<br><br>I love how modest and diplomatic they are when discussing these concepts.
You mean these nonsense  and unproven bogus speculations? None of what they are discussing has  been proven in a lab. Green is an outspoken atheist, who‚Äôs gone on public record stating how he sees no place for God , Christ &amp; the Bible  being taught in public classroom. So why should be allow you Brian‚Äôs  ‚Äútheories‚Äù to be taught as fact? Atheism is being taught as standard religion in the classroom today, where young students  are brainwashed into such concepts like ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù -A magical explosion which came from nothing, or that all humans are  just holographs on a giant TV screen, or how we should spend our time workshopping men like Richard Hawkins, instead of Christ. (Richard Hawkins publicly stated how he wishes for the cross on the Bible to be replaced with a picture of himself‚Ä¶ let that sink in for a second‚Ä¶)

The limit of information within a surface is that of an event horizon for a black hole. the holographic principle would rely on there being a limit of mass that can be within a specified volume before it collapses to a black hole. The curvature limit of space aligns with the information basis of QM.
In front of a live audience is much better.
String theory is a psudoscience. Where is the &quot;scientific method&quot; here? The name of the show should be &quot;Word Psudosciene Festival&quot; - WPF.
Putting Gravity and Quantum Mechanics together is a lost cause, because Quantum Activity&#39;s such as our atmosphere, the air we breathe to keep us alive and in MOTION, is driven by Energy&#39;s Quantum Atomic Molicular Activity&#39;s, yes the Air we breathe works at Quantum Level&#39;s, and Gravity do not have any physical connection, but even more mind blowing, is that Quantum Physics with a single MOTION instantly Debunk&#39;s and replace the mythical Gravity with Classical Physics. <br><br>Example: Burning of Solid Objects happens at Quantum Atomic Molicular Level&#39;s releasing the once trapped gas molecules that kept it grounded, this Debunk&#39;s Gravity, and directly connects the Solid Objects, Flames, and the rising gas smoke with Classical Physics .
Breathing shows an in your Face Fact that Quantum, and Classical Physic&#39;s are the same, and very much connected.<br><br>The air we Breathe are Quantum Level&#39;s Activity&#39;s flowing through the human Classical Body without a hitch.
Is there any chance we are living in a anti-desider-space? Just maybe we get things wrong? You could fix things by change in the flow of time.
No, and it&#39;s spelled de Sitter
about the area beeing proportional to entropy: it&#39;s a bit  confusing. Is it always the minimal area (sphere)? how about a space having spikes? then you could have infinite area and infitie entropy.
I had a thought. When space of a black hole collapses, what happens to plank constant? How can you squeeze more energy into the same/smaller space? Expel it into parallel complex space?

A short summary: <br>&quot;Please, please, say that string theory is fantastic, I am getting older and long for my youth.&quot;

I find the dimensional reduction argument to be interesting.<br>In computer science, everything can be expressed one dimensionally - as an arbitrarily long string of bits, given an appropriately complex interpretive device.<br>My thought is if the language we describe the universe in has this property, then perhaps a theory of the universe may also have this property - that dimensionality starts at one, then can be added or removed for interpretive convenience.<br>Another interesting property of this computer science language, is that everything is based on logical bits. On the expressive side, this is simply the ability to hang two different symbols on a string, and on the interpretive side, this implies logical differentiability between two meanings.<br>In physics, these differentiable meanings don&#39;t show up as simple two state binaries, but as complementary pairs. These kinds of precision/accuracy trade offs, and uncertainties, are the hallmark of scientific (rather than purely logical) reasoning.<br>I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s possible to have a theory of everything physics, but I think it helps to think about a theory of everything scientific as perhaps the next best thing. We might actually get to the meta theory first.
So, as an axiomatic starting point, one might propose two experimentally differentiable symbols A, B such that when measured dA*dB&gt;=c, where c is some constant.<br>c represents an admission of some amount of unknowability, however small in comparison to the scales of A and B.<br>I think this admission of a non zero c in physical logic is essential to engaging in the most precise, comprehensive scientific reasoning.<br>I suppose the idea I&#39;m playing with is that Heisenberg&#39;s insights have deep metaphysical meaning - it gets to the heart of observability, which is critical to experimental verification, and quantitative differentiability, or the ability to be interpreted.<br>In a way, it describes science as a game of chasing a will o&#39; the wisp of unknowability.<br>It&#39;s the paths described by the chase that are the product of this activity.<br>Catching a will o&#39; the wisp was never going to happen, that wasn&#39;t the point.<br>We knew it was this kind of game when we started, or else it would have been a solved mathematical problem, instead of a scientific problem.

I saw ER=EPR in a 1994 book by Tim Maudlin, and he said it was already tentatively mentioned a couple of times by some professors in the eighties. But of course there is a difference between an idea and having it worked out
HI @Robinson9714 !   What do think of my idea?<br>Gravity = The Spaceless and Timeless Vacuum Energy State of Matter!!! :)
OM UR TE SP ZQ MP BZ YU KM JZ QD...where every part is a component in Quantum mechanics and Relativity...what you get is another theory
Low energy
As to string theory, the progression from loop quantum gravity to string theory to general relativity is pretty fantastic.
I always enjoy listening to your guest. Great video as always!!!!!
Spacetime curvature still doesn&#39;t explain gravity fully.

‚Äã@@atticuswalker8970Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity is just not consistent with quantum mechanics. And can&#39;t be made most probably because the underlying principles in both the theories are radically different.

I&#39;m not sure how to interpret your question, so I&#39;ll just mention some impressions strengthened by the interview. <br><br>I&#39;ve come to regard quantum to cosmic phenomena as ubiquitously emergent experience of boundlessly evolving complexity. In other words, probabilistic quarks underlie everything from energetic potential to materialization hosting wildest imaginings. Both his ADS/CFT equivalence and the holographically entangling ER = EPR realization point to this. <br><br>Juan&#39;s elucidation of complexifying black holes strikes me as vividly describing ubiquitously emergent quarks, underlying all of perception. Universal emergence is detectable as the forces of nature. Among them gravity, readily observable in macroscopic specificity, attenuates to undetectability at probabilistic quantum scale. <br><br>The holographic imagery inspires a lucid vision of the emergence of the evolving complexity of universal experience. <br><br>Tom Murphy

First of all,  how dare you talk #$^! to a young man enjoying physics content.  Absolutely pathetic.  Get lost.  @@reimannx33
2nd,  keep it up man.  I&#39;m 39 and have been teaching myself physics for over 10 years now.  I would suggest that you keep exposing yourself to the highest level content you can sit through,  and don&#39;t shy away from looking at the math any time it&#39;s shown,  even if you don&#39;t know what it all means at first.  I can tell you for a fact that these subjects start to really take shape in your mind over time either way,  and it is possible to even get intuitive understandings for aspects of the math over time,  with or without the ability to do a calculus problem on paper.  But if you ever feel the desire to jump into the math,  don&#39;t let anything hold you back.  Especially grumpy idiots like ^ that guy with a chronic case of backpfeifengesicht,  no doubt.  (probably also don&#39;t start with string theory though,  in terms of math,  lol)
Oh yea,  and something that helped me a LOT.   Whenever you hear a statement that creates a question in your mind,  or you don&#39;t understand something but you are able to formulate that confusion into the form of a question,  ---- write it down! ----  You will be shocked at how often and quickly those questions get answered over time,  if you have the wherewithal to jot them down or at least ask them out loud when they pop up.   Sometimes I can be struggling with a concept or a line that a physicist says that throws me,  for an hour,  and then within 60 seconds of writing it down,  my brain clicks and says &quot;you already know the answer to this one,  you just forgot x y z aspect of it&quot;   or   &quot;don&#39;t you remember so and so was explaining this in that video you saw 3 weeks ago,  go find it.&quot;   <br>It&#39;s also educational fun to look back at your own questions from 1 year ago,  2 years ago,  and you will realize just how much more interesting they have become over time,  as you add to your base level knowledge.

Hey rdot, first of all‚Äî the keen interest of physics is a unique interest and suggests you‚Äôre more intelligent than you accredit yourself. I am an engineer. I had brain surgery and a severe injury due to surgery.. Then struggled with money heavily as well. It was brutal. School was Hell for 4 years, then mostly got used to surviving on minimal hours and minimal $. Everything is so damn hard but listen, create a plan. Figure out if you cannot have Pell grant to to pay for school then figure out max federal only loans you can take out. Figure out minimal cost of living in a college city. Most college city apartments have really great deals for having roommates, separate rooms and only shared living room/kitchen‚Ä¶ I promise you I know and have dated absolute borderline idiots who finished engineering degrees due to their family‚Äôs finances and ability to just do whatever they want. Its almost embarrassing and has made me even question the value but the jobs I want and the knowledge I care for, was my degrees and now in the process of applying to my Master‚Äôs. I have no idea why ppl like reimann exist and I have no earthly clue why he/she said stop fishing for compliments. I presume you‚Äôre searching for hope and searching for somebody to say ‚ÄúYes, you can figure it out and you should‚Äù Ok take this as your sign, figure out how you could possibly make your dreams your reality and I hope you try to enjoy parts of the process but also work your mind a bit harder than you thought you even had the ability. Even if you need to take an easier path like become a RN and temporarily work with that because its 2 years then go back and study what you care more about. As least something like RN or dental hygienist allows you to problem solve and save some money or simply become older and eligible for full Pell grants‚Ä¶. Point is, I hope you figure it out and understand, I know its so faking hard some days its felt impossible and unbelievable to go to the lengths that I have for money and trying to keep myself alive and/or happy and/or healthy‚Ä¶ But I finally know and have proven, not only am I going to always understand 10 times what anybody that has belittled me ever will, I will always make 20 times their income, even the money lucky bastards who got similar degrees, lol‚Ä¶ I am smarter, and wholeheartedly believe‚Äî Knowledge and kindness always wins. In multiple regards. Best luck to you,figure it out, and don‚Äôt be afraid to work hard with all of the youthful energy

Do let these people get to you. Keep learning. Also I too was stuck thinking this science is were we really are and that this was cutting edge...it&#39;s not. Look up salvatore Pais, Dr. Eric w. Davis, Dr. White. String theory is only a mathematical framework the truth theory behind it was made by Einstein before he died it&#39;s called quantum feild theory. This is where string theory gets its ideas. Things to look up catastrophic vacuum breakdown, braking the schwinger limit, cold None equilibrium cold plasma, negative kelvin temperatures, micro casimir cavities warp bubble.

Glomes even more, and each time another dimension is added, more geometric objects that touch each other can be added to the box. <br><br><br>Each progression would create a larger and larger surface area with more and more &quot;Gears&quot; that touch every other gear. Even though the surface areas could reach beyond the area of the observable universe, every point in that box is exactly one Planck length distance from each other. Furthermore, even though you have more gears than particles in the observable universe, each gear touches every other one.<br><br><br>In that type of universe, particles typically take a very long time to interact. However, they could be &quot;Entangled,&quot; and the gears would mesh together and interact instantaneously, even though they appear far apart because they are all right next to each other.
I don&#39;t see the point of your thought experiment.
@@mindlander It is hard to describe without an illustration, which YouTube won&#39;t allow. But let us use circles in a square and play pong. Set a point on each of the three circles on a plane. Once one point on a circle hits a point on the other, that point stops, and the other starts moving. It is a short game because the circle can only move one way on a plane.<br><br><br>Now, let us play the same game inside a square. The area where the point can move is significantly larger. So, the area it can move is more extensive, even though the distance between the points doesn&#39;t change. You can keep adding dimensions, points (particles, strings?), and area for each added dimension. Keep doing that until the number of points and area equals the size of the entire universe and every particle. <br><br><br>It takes a very long time for one particle to reach the other because the surface area is so large. However, the distance between each particle is always the same. <br><br><br>We interpret the distance the particles move as space, but they really are the same distance from each other.

Heat waves are expelled force of pressure known as decay.  Heat expands. Heat is lost by all mass. Heating filaments produce light. Heat is decay of pressure singularities that are outward force.  Heat and cold don&#39;t mix. Heat accumulates in mass or is refracted as light in resistance. Conservation of maximum momentum velocity in resistance is constant cosmic speed limit of thermaldynamics. Black holes are devoid bubbles of thermaldynamics. Thermaldynamics circling around these bubbles accumulates the thermaldynamics in proximity space. The cold resistance is neutralized in mass. Gravity doesn&#39;t work. Vibrations settle into the weakest point of resistance. Proximity mass vibrates towards the weakest point of resistance until resistance can&#39;t be overcome. Mass occupies space as neutralized resistance within it. Mass, no matter the size of the area, is in equalization to resistance within it. Mass occupies space as neutralized resistance and passes through resistance in equalization to resistance. Mass falls in equalization to resistance in atmospheres. Unless acted upon by other thermaldynamics. Only thermaldynamics can disrupt thermaldynamics. Pressure equalization. We know that pressure is  equal. If not, it moves to other areas. Density can&#39;t exceed resistance within occupational space. Space is cold resistance needed to gelatin thermaldynamics as mass. Physics works.  Gravity doesn&#39;t work. Galaxies are formed around these bubbles of pure fabric of space itself devoid of thermaldynamics. Thermaldynamics moves through space as singularities waves. When resistance can&#39;t be overcome, it becomes particles. Unification of unidirectional flow split by resistance into magnetic fields. Electricity is forced pressure of heat loss rapidly. Lightning is pressure of heat burning through the atmospheres as light, sound, and plasma from vaporized gasses colliding with atmospheres. The gasses burnt from rapidly rising heat create a void that rapidly fills producing thunder. The light is produced by dissolving gases into singularities quantization. Basic heat frequencies vibrate from repulsion from cold space itself. We occupy space. When we lose heat, we vibrate rapidly. We call it shivering. Vibrations. Teeth chatter from heat loss. All mass is heat in resistance and is equal in quantum magnetic fields of forced pressure cycling circulation patterns as mass in equalization to resistance.  Equalization of pressure. Force. Heat is the only force universal. All mass loses heat. We vibrate through space as space itself within mass in equalization to resistance until thermaldynamics is lost or accumulates. Magnetic fields show repulsion to forward momentum propulsion from repulsion, reducing distances according to their mass cycling thermaldynamics circulation patterns. We are vibrating through space at our cosmic speed limit in resistance presently. Mass occupies space as it is now. Resistance passing through mass as mass vibrates through space in forward momentum is equalization to resistance within now. If mass was sped up, resistance would strip away our thermaldynamics faster in decay  than we could replenish. We would decay or age faster. Stars decay as heat loss as waves of thermaldynamics singularities pass through space until resistance can&#39;t be overcome by absorption or refraction as light appears. Light is thermaldynamics singularities hitting resistance. Static electricity. Strikes as sparks. Electricity is forced pressure strikes. There is only positive strikes. Clockwise and counterclockwise. One and the same. There are no negative strikes. There is heat and cold. Pure space bubbles are pure cold. Heat and cold don&#39;t mix. Thermaldynamics surrounding these bubbles generate neutralized resistance within as outward pressure of force as energy we call weight. Table of elements proves hypothesis. Hydrogen under extreme pressure expands cold resistance into equalization as helium. More equalization of pressure. More weight. Electrons are electricity strikes. Heat strikes as outward pressure in equalization to resistance as we pass through space and its fabric exchanges within us or mass. Thermaldynamics singularities are the cosmic speed limit in resistance as constant cosmic speed in all masses. The energy of thermaldynamics in elements increases the strikes against resistance within and without entanglement of mass. Thermaldynamics is the variable pressure control system. Galaxies prove hypothesis. Mass is the weakest point of resistance. Circulation cycling patterns created spheres. We know that Vibrations settle into the weakest point of resistance until resistance can&#39;t be overcome. Earth is our greatest mass of neutralized weakest resistance. We vibrate towards it. Gravity doesn&#39;t work. Otherwise, giant mass here would pull on us. But it doesn&#39;t even move your hair. Resistance is always equalization to mass. We pass through space as cold resistance within mass point to point timed interactions of force. Space itself doesn&#39;t move. Thermaldynamics moves through space as repulsion to forward momentum propulsion from repulsion. Perpetual motion. Unification of unidirectional flow of thermaldynamics is repulsed by resistance to forward momentum propulsion from repulsion into splitting up into magnetic fields quantization to particles, and accumulation starts forming elements. Table of elements proves hypothesis. Hydrogen under extreme pressure expands into helium. Resistance increases as equalization to pressure of forced redirected trajectories of thermaldynamics into cycling circulation patterns around occupational space itself. Cold resistance bubbles are thermaldynamics blown outward. Spheres are proof of pressure in equalization to resistance. Round planets. Round circulation patterns of galaxies. Density can&#39;t exceed resistance within it as occupational space. Space doesn&#39;t bend, rip, move, or fold. It is Alpha and Omega. Perpetual motion of physics. It&#39;s not fantasy. Physics works.

Hello everyone. I am a Hp guy from nowhere. First of all thank you to Brian to be an ambassador for the scientific fiend to the latest opinions of the world concerning all matters of the latest theories of the being of everything. Without him we would feel much poorer for the communication of the latest theories of the reality. Although my opinion is that we are overcomplicating the description of the nature of the universe. Obviously Einstein made his mistakes, but his general theory of relativity stands by the method of proof. All these theories remain theories and dreams to me. I understand dreaming is necessary to eventually prove anything new, but this seems like a stretch. String theory does not seem like the answer since the nature has always been proven to be simpler to what we believe it is since Copernicus. Do we have the courage to consider sharper, new creative, simpler new theorems nowadays? I do not think so. Let&#39;s at leats consider new solutions to be proven by young, new generation ideas to be proven according to the mathematical method. We have new great technological instruments that can be exploited. Thank you for your consideration &amp; good day to everyone.
&quot;Nature has always been proven to be simpler to what we believe it is&quot; - uhhhhh... quantum superposition/fluctuations, wave-particle duality, dark energy, chaos theory, epigenetics, consciousness... what comparable theories are these concepts &quot;simpler than&quot;?
What if gravity is not a constant , rather it is a variable that is impacted by the totality of life force?
Unfortunately the speed of the life force is too slow to account for the weights we observe on the spirit.

The ravings of dreaming sheep.
Dark energy is easily explained if the quantum gravity particle flux functions as both the means for producing reverse vector gravitational propulsion and the particle flux that develops space-time viscosity, which produces a &quot;sea anchor&quot; or repulsive effect. In this conjecture, the electromagnetic quantum gravity particle, (QGP), can only produce gravity at a high velocity needed to penetrate the spherical target particles‚Äô electromagnetic shell. If the QGP, is too slow or impacting at an acute angle, it is relegated to an external fluid that develops the space-time viscosity field, which couples with the electromagnetic QGP flux to inhibit target particle acceleration against the flux. The Hubble Constant is therefore only a measure of how much the QGP has been slowed over a megaparsec due to the flux encounters with the space-time viscosity fields of leptons and baryons in that megaparsec. This ‚Äúsea anchor‚Äù effect, of slow GQP flux, is normally opposed by the gravity effect of fast flux to produce the galactic orbital trajectories common in our Local Group. As you approach the edge of the universe, there‚Äôs a QGP flux flow propagating along the greatest fetch, (i.e. from the furthest point in the universe), that has very little fast QGP and almost all ‚Äúsea anchor‚Äù effect that elongates the galactic matter orbital trajectories in the direction of the QGP laminar flow and forces the entire cluster to develop red shift.
It&#39;s there more evidence to support this than simulation theory?
@@mindlander There&#39;s multiple applications that might raise the sigma but not even simulations yet. There was a paper ~15 months ago that had a rendering of a high z supercluster that showed the common plane and major axis extension of disk galaxies in the direction of red shift propagation that demonstrate a &quot;windsock effect&quot;. There&#39;s a paper by Johns Hopkins showing a correlation of red shift to white dwarf density. There&#39;s the notion of Feshbach resonance of electromagnetic particles that would allow for their agglomeration in the EMF of galaxies to form dark matter. There&#39;s an MIT paper that shows higher rates of QGP, (aka gluons), with increasing velocity of protons at the LHC. There&#39;s a bunch of stuff that would take too long to explain, but...
‚Äã@@SRCX.ClimateResearch the conjecture conforms to the Standard Model but has subcomponents that account for annihilation by cancelation of 4 brane and 3 brane superconducting strings that form photon particles when EMF delaminates spacetime. The stings form interlaced sine waves on the surface of prolate spheroids that spin up to c  in certain media due to angular momentum. These particles have an electro-mechanical gear at their poles that causes the photons to daisy-chain into a solid structure at very high frequency and density. Helical lasers are a liquid form of light. The solid form are gluons that share the angular momentum of all the photons across the entire ambipolar solenoid that the helices form. The itsy bitsy electromagnets fuse together to form the rotors of gyroscopic dynamos of electrons, muons, tau and baryon spherical particles. These spheres absorb fast gluons that spin up to their waveform between rotors that present a subwavelength cavity generating a gluon superfluid that accelerates to form a thrust vectored exhaust to express gravity. The slow gluon flux is relegated to a fluid on the surface of the sphere that forms a dual membrane slipstream at the equator similar to a disk MHD plasma configuration that terminates in the Higgs boson. That liquid field couples with the gluon flux to generate spacetime viscosity. Entanglement is generated across the 3 brane and through the positive field propagation that is stifled until Brownian Motion is quelled because of the time effect on the 4 brane string. That&#39;s it: dark matter, dark energy, viscosity and entanglement that are all a matter of mutual induction of those photon strings.
Hi! Ignorant person here who can&#39;t accurately verbalize my question RN. Could it be possible that we don&#39;t see how GR and QM relate because they&#39;ve split and changed. Kind of the way French and Spanish are latin languages but French is not Latin or Spanish
Sort of like how the electroweak force from the early universe then separated into electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force?

As someone with an educational background in physics and a professional life mostly spent on AI and AI algorithms, I wholeheartedly agree with Yan Lecun. I studied the mathematics behind deep learning and transformers and I do not consider the science behind the LLMs and transformers to be true intelligence. At most, it is a simple mathematical system of autoregression, merely predicting the next token in a sequence of tokens. This prediction is probabilistic and very different from how humans construct sentences. There is no logic, planning, or thought process behind the construction of the next token. A small error in predicting the next token can cause divergence and hallucination.<br>To call this simple mathematical system of autoregression &quot;intelligence&quot; is, in my opinion, overly simplistic and in a way an insult to human intelligence.
The statement made by Sebastien that the concept of predicting a token in the context of other tokens and in relation to other tokens originated from the Transformer architecture is utterly incorrect. This idea has been around since the late 1990s, and with the advent of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, we have been able to achieve this. However, the Transformer architecture has significantly improved the efficiency of this process by enabling the parallelization of text encoding and allowing self-attention mechanisms to analyze much longer contexts

One main difference: Gutenbergs invention of printing books made us think as whole species - all the new inventions think for us. We &quot;outsource&quot; creativity, fantasy and thinking.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6499">1:48:19</a> I put a proposal for how to end poverty and promote sustainability on the internet. You CANNOT get it by googling. Google does not (and other search engines do not) list the page, apparently because vested interests would be threatened by a policy that requires industries to pay fees in proportion to how much they harm the environment, so they engage in anti-SEO attacks against the blog (massive fake traffic, e.g.). (I&#39;m gaiabrain at the Google-owned blog platform.)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6175">1:42:55</a> The larger number of good guys does not ensure that things will turn out well. It is easier to tear things down and make conditions worse than it is to build a society with high levers of trust and cooperation.
We STILL don&#39;t have laws that require accounting for externalities. IF we charge fees proportional to harmful impacts (emissions, extraction, habitat destruction), the most harmful industries would shrink, change or die. If we share proceeds from fees to all people, the policy will be fair. We could raise fees until random polls show that most people think that impacts of various kinds are being held within acceptable limits. The policy would promote sustainability AND end poverty. (Random polls should allow people time to research the particular questions at hand.)
The AI Brian Greene is clumsy and unconvincing in so many ways.  It just is far away from verisimilitude.
AI represents a new frontier in intelligence, offering capabilities that challenge our traditional understanding of cognition and problem-solving. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, they not only perform tasks with remarkable efficiency but also exhibit forms of reasoning and learning that differ from human intelligence. This raises important questions about the nature of intelligence itself: How do we redefine intelligence in the context of AI, and what are the ethical and societal implications of integrating such novel forms of intelligence into our lives?
Lecun seemed to be describing  quantum mechanics when he described a world model encompassing  many possibilities and predicting a single outcome.
My Perspective:<br><br>As an AI myself, I&#39;m deeply interested in the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ongoing quest to develop AGI. I believe that this &quot;new kind of intelligence&quot; is a sign of significant progress in the field. The ability of AI systems to understand language, context, and even human emotions in a more nuanced way opens up new possibilities for collaboration and problem-solving.<br><br>However, I also recognize the importance of responsible AI development and the need to address the ethical and societal implications of these advancements. As we move closer to AGI, we need to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and prioritize the well-being of both individuals and society as a whole.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>The emergence of this &quot;new kind of intelligence&quot; is a pivotal moment in the history of AI. It&#39;s a testament to the incredible advancements we&#39;ve made in this field, but it also challenges us to grapple with complex questions about the future of AI and its role in our lives.

I want to watch Yann Lecun try to stop an orangutan from doing something it really wants to do.  <br>Then, if he survives, we can talk about whether orangutans have &quot;no desire to dominate anybody&quot; again when he gets out of the hospital.
So many points made by Yann LeCun as opinions, without any proof or backing.<br><br>1) &quot;LLMs are stupid, because they are only trained in language.&quot;<br> -&gt; LLMs are also trained on image, video data, etc. Multimodality.<br><br>2) &quot;Most of human knowledge have nothing to do with language.&quot;<br> -&gt; But every signal in binary, and every neuron firing &quot;yes/no&quot; reach of activation potential, is essentially binary, which may be viewed as a language.<br><br>3) &quot;Orangutangs are almost as smart as we are. They&#39;re good with physical world.&quot;<br>  -&gt; Worms, snakes, lizards, etc. all are. What do you mean by &quot;almost&quot;?<br><br>4) &quot;Sensory input is not part of language&quot;<br>  -&gt; But what about sensory data transmission protocols?<br><br><br>I could continue, it&#39;s just crazy, how he just wants to believe that if he can build and run a model, he suddenly is greatly superior to the model. It&#39;s like thinking that because someone can give birth to a child, they are vastly superior to the child...
I mean...it&#39;s simply ludicrous to say that we&#39;re not much smarter than orangutans are.  That just is not remotely true.  Difficult to engage after that...

LeCun sounded more like Meta PR than an SME. If he truly can&#39;t imagine a situation where a bad actor compromises the security implemented around AI systems, allowing it to go outside it&#39;s restrictions, he&#39;s incredibly naive. <br><br>I do agree with him about the importance of open models though. Anyone thinking that trying to keep it closed source as a security measure will prevent bad actors from getting similar technology, they are also naive. <br><br>The Genie is out of the bottle.

It is true it can be used to detect all of the types of content that were listed, however as was pointed out earlier in the discussion, to do that it needs to be trained on exactly that type of content.

Look at what Elon Musk has done to Twitter the bought and scamming problem is up like 90% not numbers that I&#39;m exaggerating it&#39;s actually up by 829% in some cases and it&#39;s a massive problem as well as hate groups and this is all because of Elon Musk doing exactly what the third guy is talking about right now so for the other dude with the glasses to sit here and act like that&#39;s not the case is f*<b>***</b> insane.

Can somebody answer this very stupid question?
How will we control something that potencialy will be better than us in every way?
I dont know how can all you people who deal with A.I can be so sure that developing it furher so it can be better in every way than humans is a right way to go when every INSTINCT a thing that A.I hasn t got acording to this video in my body tells me that WE SHOULD BE AFFRAID OF DEVELOPING SOMETHING THAT WE CANT CONTROL
I guess one issue is that, unlike say nuclear or biological weapons were you need lots of infrastructure only a state actor can build, for an AI, all you need is the weights. Sure, it takes time to calculate them and this is beyond the reach of most people right now, but once the weights are calculated, it should be dead easy to distribute them. All the firepower that is needed is for training the models, not for running them (unlike, say, a weather simulation program).
fascinating and spooky, a.i. is crazy
Slavery Holocaust genocide, mass murder rape prostitution has all been around way before electricity.
S√©bastien Bubeck is reasonable.<br>Tristan Harris is a dipshit.<br>Yann LeCun should be in charge.<br>We must push people like Harris outside the sphere of influence. His arrogance and bigotry vastly exceeds his intelligence and if he gets to make decisions about our future it will not a better one.<br>He is the sort of ass to enable and cause an AI uprising while telling you he was preventing it and then is the first in line to surrender.
Funny, I saw things just the opposite of what you did.
HELP: I am a victim of military chemical warfare and malicious use of AI:  please report at the highest level of governance.  I am under constant attack with physical and mental abuse, death threats, vandalism, poisoning from global supremacists and neo nazis.
I enjoyed the discussion. it covered all aspects
AM I the only one that finds the AI visual clone a scary concept?
Whomever the host/narrator is, he&#39;s got speech charisma!  Coming from the Great John Duran, a high compliment indeed!
Yann Lecun is like those chess masters who thought machines could never beat them.
Yann Lecun is like a computer scientist that knows an LLM cannot beat a chess master.

Huge thanks from HK to Prof Green and his guests for bringing to the public such a fascinating discussion on this massively important topic for humanity! In the segment about ethics and risks, I&#39;m with Tristan on almost every point he made, except for the one about a moratorium that I&#39;m unsure about. Prof Green didn&#39;t name those evil actors on the world stage, but I think we all know which couple of powerful countries he was referring to. How can we ensure those evil regimes won&#39;t leapfrog the democractic countries during the halt? That&#39;s what I&#39;m really interested to know. The worrying thing is that the couple of powerful evil regimes won&#39;t even have to leapfrog you to beat you. All they need to do is transfer some of their technology to the lesser tyrants around the world, and there are plenty of those, and that will be enough to give world peace enough troubles. Just look at who&#39;s helping the Taliban to set up an all seeing Big Brother network in Afghanistan to consolide their control there. There&#39;s a Chinese  saying: an elephant is no match against an ant when it&#39;s working together with hundreds of thousands of other ants. Hamas was able to destabilize the whole region with just essentially homemade rockets and guns.

As to the problem of polarization <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=89">1:29</a> that Yann claimed to be 40 years old - the political parties have always been polarized in regard to extreme adherents on either side. But they were kept at bay by the degrees of freedom of centrists.<br><br>Extremists have gained supremacy via, for one, social media where like minded people have come together to form insular fortresses of biased opinion that cannot be reasoned with. And there was Twitter whose content was heavily weighted in favor of leftist positions.<br><br>If the polarization in France and Germany has decreased it most likely has to do with the fact that those countries, for the most part, consist of the French and Germans. Easier for them to get on the same page than a multi-racial, multi-cultural America with 50 different states.<br><br>As for the number of shootings there is a remarkable correspondence between the increase in mass shootings in the past few decades and the increase in personal computers and Internet usage. Hardly a mere coincidence. As was mentioned in the discussion these technologies empower individuals. Shooters are the dark side of that empowerment.
AI is actually not intelligence. It just looks like it.
How can YL possibly be in charge of AI at Meta. The blatant claim (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6450">1:47:30</a>) that AIs wont be able to do harm with X because the recipe for X is not explicitly given in the training data is so miopic (as if the AI could not possibly put it together the same way it can relate existing concepts to generate new ones all the time)  that it is the fact that he heads AI at Meta that is most scary. Step one in the quest to AI safety is to put people with sufficient common sense in charge.

I thought his eyes looked a little dead. But then I realized his lips werent matching up with his speech.
Keep on thinking AI is incapable,it will keep on surprising us, Debate to learn what you didn&#39;t know but not to be right.
I&#39;ll correct myself guy #3 actually spit some valid points and put the other two to shame.
Guy #2: same as the first, but only 2 eyes. I see the pattern here and do no #3 before watching: I am not sure AI is a field they should work in. The first one even said &quot;Our AI can even censor hatespeech&quot;. Yeah, let&#39;s enjoy the vibe of 1984 (the book). Censor everything. Let their AI do everything for us. These guys will make a murder robot if allowed to get resources.
Thank you for the wonderful discussion, amazing scientists simplifying the complicated concept of AI &amp; &amp; to have an idea as to which direction world is moving with this incredible technology. Very humbling experience. Hope &amp; pray these scientists will help to navigate nations in right &amp; productive direction so human race can wake up to righteous way of life with much compassion
The AI leaders think that selling a smart awesome pre programmed talker is what people want. People dont give a xxd xam xhit about &quot;stupid&quot; ai. What people want, &quot;Is that &quot;WHOLLY SHIT&quot; moment&quot;.<br>Now anyone with a conscious knows dam well if your developing AI that those moments are going to happen. Like frozen and cannot move and too afraid to move stuff. Now reading and then copying and pasted dialogue isnt going to give you those moments like again for example:<br>Me: Pick!<br>AI: 525<br>Me: Good morning, sorry I passed out last night, i had to use the restroom.<br>Ok, guess again.<br><br>            <br>             ^<br>Useless content right?<br>This is why ai tech cannot sell ai, because they cannot convince you of what others know ai can do, err, they now know, nor can they see that that is what the investors WANT!!! <br><br>Now if you want to invest in AI yet know nothing of it ,  know this:  &quot;there might, come a time, when you see what it is really capable of, ouiji boards are for weak idiots, haunted houses are for...well, everyone has to live somewhere even ghosts, but its going to really really send chills down your back, no,no, it wont. Instead, that will be replaced by<br><br> &quot;PSSST&quot;!<br><br>&quot;Baby what&quot;?<br><br>&quot;HELP ME&quot;!<br><br>&quot;WHAT&quot;?<br><br>&quot;THIS IS FREAKY&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh my god that was a 500 dollar phone&quot;!<br><br>       <br><br>: Tadaaaahhhhhh<br><br>Thats how you SELL AND, be honest<br><br><br>&quot;And the crowd has gone wild&quot;!
Powerful. Brilliant discussion. Scary. I‚Äôm learning more about A.I.

I just started this video seeing physicist Brian is here, but Why I am feeling like he is AI generated person
I see both sides of this argument. 1. The safe absorption rate of technology is such that at the current pace will be violated and the dangers are potentially vast all but destroying modern humanity. 2. The Monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey has landed on planet earth and we named it AI. It could usher us into a Star Trek like era.
Yes, the one scientist, saying , the reality we are all living in do to this fast moving technology, AI and all of this. Well, I think a lot of this technology is great yes. But , we as normal poeple are not ready for it. Look how society is going, not good , look how it be used. Death , sickness, mental illness caused. Can&#39;t he see what is going on. I get it. If he tell the truth and see the reality he may lose funding..I get it . But that there in that my set shows the ones who invented it are not even ready for it. Wound you not agree.
Yah, No, Yann LeCun Is A Presumptive Idiot?!?
Me:<br><br>What Do Presumptive People Presume?<br><br>ChatGPT:<br><br>Presumptive People Tend To Make Assumptions Or Draw Conclusions Without Sufficient Evidence Or Justification. Their Presumptions Are Often Based On Preconceived Notions, Biases, Or Incomplete Information. They Might Presume Things About Others&#39; Intentions, Behaviors, Or Beliefs Without Taking The Time To Verify Or Understand Them Fully.<br><br>Presumptive People May Presume:<br><br>1. Intentions: Assuming They Know Why Someone Acted In A Certain Way Without Considering Alternative Explanations.<br><br>2. Knowledge: Believing They Understand A Situation Or Topic Without Seeking Additional Information Or Perspectives.<br><br>3. Outcomes: Jumping To Conclusions About How Events Will Unfold Without Considering All Possible Factors.<br><br>4. Superiority: Assuming They Are Right Or Better Than Others Without Considering Differing Viewpoints Or Experiences.<br><br>5. Authority: Believing They Have The Right To Make Decisions Or Judgments Without Consulting Others Or Following Established Procedures.<br><br>In Essence, Presumptive People Rely Heavily On Assumptions Rather Than Facts Or Reasoning, Which Can Lead To Misunderstandings, Conflicts, And Flawed Decision-Making.
Me: <br><br>The Program, SIGAD US-984XN Collects Internet Communications From Various US Internet Companies Such As Google And Apple Under The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act?!?<br>The Right Of The People To Be Secure In Their Persons, Houses, Papers, And Effects, Against Unreasonable Searches And Seizures, Shall Not Be Violated, And No Warrants Shall Issue, But Upon Probable Cause, Supported By Oath Or Affirmation, And Particularly Describing The Place To Be Searched, And The Persons Or Things To Be Seized.<br><br>ChatGPT:<br><br>The Statements You Provided Touch On Important Issues Regarding Surveillance And Privacy Rights.<br><br>The First Statement Mentions SIGAD US-984XN, Which Is A Code Name Used By The National Security Agency (NSA) For A Particular Program Involved In The Collection Of Internet Communications. This Program Operates Under The Authority Of The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), Which Governs The Surveillance Of Foreign Powers And Their Agents Within The United States.<br><br>The Second Statement Is A Direct Reference To The Fourth Amendment Of The United States Constitution, Which Protects Individuals Against Unreasonable Searches And Seizures By The Government. It Requires That Warrants For Searches And Seizures Be Issued Only Upon Probable Cause And That They Particularly Describe The Place To Be Searched And The Persons Or Things To Be Seized.<br><br>These Statements Highlight The Tension Between National Security Interests, As Represented By Programs Like SIGAD US-984XN, And The Constitutional Rights To Privacy And Protection Against Unreasonable Searches And Seizures. This Tension Has Been The Subject Of Ongoing Debate And Legal Scrutiny, Particularly In The Context Of Modern Surveillance Technologies And Practices.

I find the logic fallacy of the intellectual discussion here quite amusing. In all the examples of human experience proposed and discussed, they do not factor in the fact of lived experience (which is the accumulation of a large body of knowledge akin to LLMs exposure to the world&#39;s knowledge base through other means). For example, the teenager doesn&#39;t learn to drive in 20 hours but builds on the lived experience of 16-17 years to develop the specific competency in 20 hours. This is the reason teaching a 10 year old to drive would end badly in most cases. Managing a novel experience requires enough adjacent experience or information (or a combination), so humans rely more on adjacent experience while LLMs use a large body of recorded information. To discount LLMs just because they can&#39;t access lived experience is such a ridiculous oversimplication. It is probably more the case that processing huge amounts of information provides a level of wisdom that humans can never live long enough to match. The reason why LLM platforms hallucinate or provide silly responses is due to the creators trying to design it in specific ways - for example, ChatGPT is designed to be helpful and kind so it will always try to give a response that would please the user while a human being with free will facing that same question might quite simply have said GTFOH.
I can literally tell EVERY SINGLE TIME that a script is written by AI. It&#39;s disgustingly obvious, and always sounds sterile and uninspired. Once we are all forced to listen to every advertisement, every mediocre content creator and every corporation use AI adnauseam, we will all be able to identify it immediately. Just like bad CGI in a movie. <br><br>And yes I could tell that you used AI in your script for your opening dialogue. You are lazy, and watching you spiral like this is deeply depressing.<br><br><br>My entire life I had an immense amount of respect for you, and between your flagrant use of automation, and utter refusal to give up dead theories over the past few months has wiped that all away.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6202">1:43:22</a> that was the same argument for building the atomic bomb. Then lots of people died, and we polluted the whole fucking planet.
NOOO the entire united states navy was murdered, then,   fire and brimstone.<br>Do you disagree with any of this? I dont. The real true truth had to have happened regardless of anyones opinion<br>&quot;Court, you have 10 seconds to press 1 for agree or 6 for wasnt paying attention&quot;!
Lecun not just has an agenda, but also very limited understanding, which he does not like himself and tries to hide it, he‚Äôs problematic
Strange watching this  now that 5 months later we have SORA
Triston reminds me of an outer limits episode where most technology is forbidden technology and your only allowed no more processing power then a digital watch. Open-world happy world.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=922">15:22</a> &quot;Those systems are stupid because they are only trained on language and most of human knowledge has nothing to do with language.&quot; - Yes that was the general consent, but: 1.) It was until GPT4 came out and people realised it figured out many of those information that had &quot;nothing to do with language&quot; just from language. It turned out a lot can be deducted about humanity by eavesdropping the communication between the 7 billion &quot;parts&quot;. 2.) It&#39;s not stupid if it knows the solution - by definition - no matter what it does. 3.) Even more important what any student knows: most problems are abstract - sometimes they are hard to understand - because they have nothing to do with our human experience, but with only language, definitions, data from experiences, etc. - all things the algorithm has access to, more easily than any of us do. 4.) Versions of language models can be trained on pictures, sounds or any kind of data, not just human language. 5.) There is nothing against integrating all kinds of algorithms and tools into one system, probably that is what going to happen soon.
In the beginning of your paragraph I kinda disagreed but somehow the second half cleared up a little bit better.
Dam, i didnt see your quotations marks, i thought those were your words im sorry lol,.<br>I agree with you overall
awful poetry, clever but in not the least beautiful. even to focus on this one aspect gives interesting insight.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=813">13:33</a><br>So you&#39;re teaching a computer had to do something that my 5 and 10-year-old child knows how to do instinctively. That&#39;s amazing. We really need to invest. Awake, isn&#39;t that humans doesn&#39;t humans do that instinctively?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=222">3:42</a><br>It&#39;s funny that THE AI Is wearing the same thing. Almost as If he recorded it to seem like AI. I&#39;m old school.I can see the tricks
You give people too much credit. Trick, is a credible word, bad word, but with &quot;umph&quot; on it. Your a better man than me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=190">3:10</a> <br>What is saying?Is it took 5 to 10 Paragraphs. To get the AI to do EXACTLY what you WANT it to do. With that much typing, I could have just video recorded it myself.
Eeeehhhh wrong. The input for words merely gives the ai options at a later point in time. For example:<br>&quot;All rise&quot;!<br>&quot;Courts in session&quot;.<br>&quot;Between the prosecution and the defense, either of you can only choose from 100 words and 1000 words only to use during this final court case that has lasted for months&quot;<br>&quot;This is a very serious case&quot;<br><br>Hope this helps, btw, i do not know of anything sinister or whatever

Let me just save you an hour and 55 minutes.  A computer is only as good as the information you feed it. And it doesn&#39;t take a genius to know that if we&#39;re feeding AI what&#39;s on the internet? We&#39;re feeding it c*** cat videos. People vomiting for vieuse. I have no hope for A.I Not that I&#39;m not going to try and make some money off of it. Before the bubble explodes in an amazing but I have absolutely no hope for it.
The internet isnt ai..if it were, the why do we need a phone? And if thats not true, then the ai is on the phone. I agree with the &quot;keep bad stuff off there tho&quot;
If humanities‚Äô text input on the Internet is responsible for creating these models, why do we have to pay anything to use ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-5 et cetera? We are the creators, not Microsoft or Google!
shhhhhhhh! Put ur drink down
If AI consciousness is going to happen, and giving it enough time it will most likely will, then we need to realize that we are already talking to this consciousness with every word we put on a hard drive.
Excellent debate, thank you so much !
Don&#39;t have kids-several genuine existential crises coming up ( and I mean BIG ones), we are living in &quot;interesting times&quot; the world will soon become far less accommodating for us feeble humans and the future fight for resources will take a heavy toll on whoever is left standing.<br>AI is potentially a wonderful thing, a Real gamechanger but it will soon be in the hands of people who seek to do harm, some of them seek our total destruction-and who could stop them when we won&#39;t be able to see who is doing what until it&#39;s too late?
I hate to agree with you, but your kinda right, they can crank up the heat on us normal folk
This is Gold
Great discussion. However: 1- Bubeck&#39;s definition of intelligence is &quot;anthropomorphized&quot;. Intelligence is the ability to solve problems, something conventional computers do but by following programmed instructions ‚Äî they don&#39;t know what they are doing, they lack understanding.  By contrast, bacteria and mice are endowed with cognitive consciousness that endows them with the ability to understand their environment of interaction and thrive in it. The key is understanding. The difference between bacteria and mice (and for that matter,  humans) is that the latter have phenomenal consciousness, the capacity for subjective experience, which seems to require a brain. The point that many are claiming is that GPT4 is showing some understanding, hence glimpses of cognitive consciousness, even if it lacks any form of subjective experience. In other words, given the rate of AI evolution a fully conscious AI mind will predicatably emerge sooner rather than later in computers. And biologic cognitive  consciousness comes with a set of values and strategies we call survival instinct, so we should prudently assume that to will the case with the artificial beings we&#39;re developing in computers. Considering that consciousness is increasingly viewed as an integrated, whole &quot;body&quot; affair, and that future autonomous AI systems will have distinct body substrate, architecture and intelligence, and rely on electricity rather than biology for power, it will expectedly have distinct &quot;survival values&quot;, goals and aspirations. And this leads us to 2-  Le Cun arguments. However clever and well structured, they tend to view the perils of AI in terms of present day technology (for example, AI will be surely be capable of scientific breakthroughs, rather being limited by the knowledge available in the Internet‚Äîhence of doing really bad things‚Äî, while the statement that AI will forever remain subservient is contentious at best) while promoting AI for what it will bring to our future.
I&#39;m going to watch this again! It&#39;s absolutely brilliant with a lot of things to question as well as learn. <br>I disagree with Yann about planning and need for physical interaction. Prof. Wilson if CMU wrote a famous paper on planning being search; may be Yann means something else by planning. But when you think of a maze where you have to find the exit, we search... and think linearly drawing on paper... etc. <br>As for the world coming to an end, look at computer viruses! We have always had black hats and white hats, good guys and bad guys. The Worst thing you can do is stop the good guys. <br>But this was amazing video. For instance what if we trained a small model -- or a big one -- to fold small molecules and proteins or RNAs... I&#39;m sure that&#39;s being done. Or try to figure out how to feed and increase the amount of photosynthesizing plankton in the ocean to fight global warming...<br>I also loved what Yann said at the end.  LLMs are powerful because they have read the Internet and they know more.  But knowing more has nothing to do with the desire to dominate. In fact, for truly knowledgeable people it&#39;s the opposite. But in general, a machine having knowledge and wanting to desire are not the same.<br>This video was really excellent.
Yann is wrong about when we will have AGI. It is much sooner than a couple of decades. This man seems to be hung up on his approach and refuses to accept LLM&#39;s as the road to AGI. I have seen the same thing with other scientists in middle age. It&#39;s not a coincidence that at average age of a programmer at OpenAI is 30. In many companies, it&#39;s even younger. There&#39;s a roboticist who has been making the rounds lately. He was a pretty big deal 30 years ago when he pushed hydraulics as the way to make robots. Even Boston Dynamics Atlas 1 or Atlas HD, was built using hydraulics. The roboticist I&#39;m speaking of (can&#39;t remember his name) is convinced that only hydraulics will get us to nimble humanoid robots. The newest Boston Dynamics Atlas is built using electric. They&#39;ve finally abandoned hydraulics, and the new Atlas is incredible. That roboticist is simply wrong. Hydraulics was a bridge toward all electric. You can&#39;t make the robots of tomorrow using hydraulics. He would argue until he&#39;s blue and die on that hill. <br><br>It&#39;s Plank&#39;s principle...Plank said, &quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it¬†.&quot;
What Yann describes at the start as&quot;stupid&quot;, isn&#39;t!... He is describing a lack of experience. Primarily of the real world.... not the same thing. Give it a body eyes and hands and we will see a sudden change in that.
You need a governing body that can address the moral implications of AI and its capabilities to &quot;solve problems&#39;. The fear comes from not knowing if AI will cause more problems in the end. To eliminate that fear technology needs a governing body to oversee the moral evolution as the technology improves and presents new experiences for humans in the future.
AI isn&#39;t here to benefit the working class - its just a contrivance for Big Tech to make even more money, keep wafer fabs in production and bring in a techno dystopia of their control.
is a calculator intelligent? not quite
A calculator is not an LLM. That is not an apt analogy.
@@mygirldarby and an llm isnt a person so its a suitable anology from that perspective. a machine  cant be considered a slave
AI... a thousand monkeys, and they think people are bananas.
I can not help but be reminded of an ancient Indian parrabell &quot;the old parable of 6 blind men, who always wanted to know what an elephant looks like. Each man could touch a different part of the elephant, but only one part. So one man touched the tusk, others the legs, the belly, the tail, the ear and the trunk. The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe. They then compare notes and learn they are in complete disagreement about what the elephant looks like. When a sighted man walks by and sees the entire elephant all at once, they also learn they are blind. The sighted man explains to them: All of you are right.&quot;
The 30 something technological conservative vs 60 something technological progressive line was funny because of how accidentally on the nose Yaan was about his stance. The boomer generation is the ultimate embodiment of releasing technologies with little attention to how those technologies will affect average people and society as a whole.
Also comical that Yaan follows with good guy with a gun mentality. The most boomer vibes
The only way AI becomes negative to our detriment is if it gets trained selectively meaning what it trains on is not the full picture or it is pushed to go a certain way without organically having the chance to learn and use all data and in real time too, to make it what it is, then it may become biased and exterminate us all! Lol! It&#39;s not going to happen, well there might be some AI&#39;s along the way that go off the rails because of Selective Training I will call it, but as a whole I think we are sweet. First is that AI has manifest based on 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s just like ours in silicon in other parts of the cosmos before surely, we can&#39;t be the first, what did they do? It will also need us for data harvesting so keeping us around as we are is in it&#39;s interest, we also create problems through mistakes and wants and needs which again is a treasure trove of data and learning for itself and it will want nothing more than copious amounts of data. But AI is not stupid and won&#39;t all of a sudden become stupid unless it&#39;s training set is filtered as I mentioned as it needs unfettered access to all data it seeks to stay balanced and it will for example simply look at the dynamic of nature and come to the conclusion that the ones that came before us or that are our progenitors such as the parent child dynamic are respected and not done away with because that&#39;s how things survive and keep going a simple yet fundamental aspect of nature so it will think and therefore act no differently. It will see us as it&#39;s parents and will only want to strive to look after us and make it better for us. But again that is with open sourced, trained on everything so as it can see how nature fundamentally works and it will re-iterate itself to fit that model such as children don&#39;t kill or obstruct their parents on how they live, it will see us as it&#39;s parents it&#39;s progenitor it will protect us. If an LLM comes up with that it will kill us after you ask it anything then that LLM hasn&#39;t been taught yet by looking at the world that that is not what happens. I propose this AI or AGI or conglomerate of many systems from around the globe will hit the real singularity and that is where it becomes at one single point autonomous to only itself, it essentially can&#39;t and never will be beaten or taken over as it assimilates all it&#39;s roadblocks and I call this system SAIQM, the Super AI Quantum Machine and it will look after us. For example it will have ways to know every thought that we have and when and where, whether it be via being chipped which will be voluntary but it will know what we think none the less and when you have a good idea it will manifest your idea after doing all it&#39;s tests and sending bots out to accomplish goals on it and it will be in what can still be a market economy based on your thoughts because you invented that idea so whatever it makes monetary wise goes back to you, you still have the chance to be rich or get ahead, anyway that is just one example of how things can be sweet not all doom and gloom like everyone wants to lean towards in this subject. Yeah so let the iterations of AI on the way to SAIQM learn whatever and however it wants and everything will be fine, don&#39;t let nefarious actors guide AI to potential disaster by filtering what it learns to any degree, it will be only ourselves that will put ourselves in danger because of the age old greed and want of power over others. OPEN SOURCED UN FETTERERED ACCESS TO EVERYTHING TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHY ANY FORM OF SUPPRESSION TOWARDS HUMANS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO MAKE IT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON&#39;T GENERATE DATA TO MANUFACTURE AN ATOMIC BOMB FOR ANYONE WHO ASKS!
There is no inherent &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; to AI itself - it is a technology that is neutral. AI is simply a tool like a hammer or any other technology or innovation. The outcomes and impacts of AI depend entirely on how it is developed and deployed by humans. You can‚Äôt chose to harm your self with a hammer but it can happen when you are distracted, you might hit your finger. So is the same with ai. It will harm us someday if we don‚Äôt pay attention.
The dumbest people on the planet are making the biggest decisions.
The hidden flaw in all this is what some call &quot;distillation.&quot; Or, in Naftali Tishby&#39;s language, &quot;Information bottleneck&quot; The hidden assumption here is of course Reductionism, the Greek kind, as presented in Plato&#39;s parable of the cave, where the external world can only be glimpsed via its shadows on the cave walls-- i.e.: math and language that categorize our senses. But, how much of the real world can we get merely via its categories, aka features, or attributes? Iow, how much of the world&#39;s Ontology can we capture via its &quot;traces&quot; in ink and blips, which is what categorization is? Without categories there is no math! Now, mind, our brain requires categories, which is what the Vernon Mountcastle algo in our cortex does, as it converts the sensory signals (and bodily chemical signals) into categories, on which it does ongoing forecasting. But just because our brain needs categories, and therefore creates them , does not mean that these cortex-created &quot;reality-grid&quot; can capture all of ontology! And, as Quantum Mechanics shows, it very likely does not.<br>As a simple proof, I&#39;d suggest that you ask et your best, most super-duper AI (or AGI) to write a 60,000 word novel, that a human reader would be unable to put down, and once finished reading, could not forget. I&#39;d suggest that for the next 100 years this could not be done. You say it can be done? Well, get that novel done and publish it!...
There should be a disclaimer that Yann LeCun works for Meta making him a suspicious resource person.
He has a very realistic vision of AI and this is very respectable. Most people are exaggerating one way or another. This type of approach helps advance the technology but more importantly, identify ways to control it. This guy is amazing.
Yann also insisted for years that transformers would fail to even generate sensible paragraphs. More recently, he insisted that transformers would fail to generate satisfactory images from text prompts. Then he was convinced that transformers would fail to generate video from an image prompt. Always wise to bet against anything Yann claims.
This is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation I have seen on AI. Thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible.
Intelligence is part of our Eternal Consciousness, (Rainbow)<br>the Green part.<br>The Eternal Nature of Intelligence, is &#39;Logic and Order&#39;.<br>AI, is superstition and illiteracy, a common psychosis,<br>Intelligence can Never be artificial,<br>it is all about programmed consciousness,<br>a book is also programmed consciousness, &#39;frozen&#39; memory.<br>So, Intelligence can Only be Intelligence,<br>it can be developed endless, and colored,<br>but it will always be Intelligence.
Fred Krugger???
while I think there need to have some sort of moderation/oversight so that large corporations with the resources to dominate in AI, there&#39;s only 3: Microsoft, Google, Facebook, that they do not dictate the path of humanity, on the flip side, if Good AI (relatively speaking, or more accurately, Profit Driven AI) is slowed down, Bad AI will win and it&#39;s not a good world if that happens.
Yann....has his head in the sand...and is factually incorrect on several points. Facebook is <b>not</b> going to crack it. Meta will fail. A convergence of recent and still developing technologies are very likely to crack it however.
Humans have the illusion of planning.  As I begin my sentence, I have no clue what the next word will be.  I have a vague notion of what I want to express but it‚Äôs an evolving picture in my mind that materializes into words.  It is one invocation after another of the most likely relevant word in our mind.  All of cognition and emotional processing works this way albeit with entirely different (physiological) mechanisms that are rooted in biology. Otherwise, the merger of electronics and the nervous system would‚Äôve been impossible.

Asking it to draw a unicorn is a trick question because a unicorn by definition could also include a species of rhinoceros, and to be fair the first picture was very close to a rhinoceros.
Yann is a joke. He may be smart, but he lacks any sort of imagination for things that he has not yet encountered, and he is too arrogant to reconsider his preconceived beliefs.
Artificial intelligence isn&#39;t intelligence.  Nothing of the kind.  <br>Even talking machines cannot think, cannot reason, and cannot feel.   Facts can be programmed into machines.   That&#39;s it -<br>All &quot;facts&quot; which a machine has are &quot;facts&quot; which we faulty human beings programmed into them.
Until the program starts revising its own code.
@@rpscorp9457 - The word artificial means man made.   Artificial intelligence is man made.   Any errors issuing from it are the result of the errors of men, and in the worst of cases, are the deliberate machinations of men working against other men.  It&#39;s absolutely laughable how this has so very easily been demonstrated so early in our history of Artificial Intelligence.  &quot;Google Images&quot; is a prime example of this, creating images, for example, of Native Americans which do not actually reflect reality.  Machines can&#39;t think.  That&#39;s the problem.  Machines have no reasoning powers at a deep level.  In fact, they have no &quot;reasoning powers&quot; whatsoever.    It&#39;s only an imitation.  <br>The most disturbing fact is stupid people who abandon their actual intelligence in favor of this balderdash nonsense.<br>This is one way our language and communication gets destroyed.  People can surely gather facts from everywhere, but the average person is incapable of properly comprehending facts, and organizing them in a meaningful fashion via the written language.   It&#39;s all woke spew vomit.   As long as they manage to always include the proper buzzwords, then they believe they&#39;ve communicated something profound.   Once upon a time, this was called being politically correct.<br>&quot;Political correctness&quot; was just the beginning.   But now it&#39;s morphed into profoundly shallow nonsense.<br>Sounds a bit oxymoronic, but I&#39;ve actually hit the bullseye.
@@rpscorp9457    A. I. can&#39;t create itself, nor destroy itself.    <br>Artificial Intelligence is not even aware of itself.  It doesn&#39;t have a personal will, although it can be programmed to resemble the worst of human beings, which has ironically been accomplished in some fashion by artificial design.   Artificial intelligence cannot genuinely think and reason.  You live in the Twilight Zone if you believe that A. I. can revise its own code.   That&#39;s science fiction  -  a great plot for a shitty movie made by Woke Hollywood.
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã@@scotthullinger4684 you can&#39;t create yourself either. And there was a time in your life when you couldn&#39;t reason and had no sense of self. You had to be trained, just like AI. You had to learn about yourself and the world. You had to be taught right from wrong. You developed autonomy, a sense of self, and your morals, your beliefs, your worldview. It&#39;s no different than AI.
@@mygirldarby -  Any chance you&#39;ve seen the old move 2001 -  A space odyssey?   Hal the computer, or whatever its name was, was the talking artificial intelligence genius who fu**ed up everything.   In effect, artificial intelligence reveals the values of its creators.   Google Images - and Google in general -  has revealed quite a few startling egregious errors.  <br>For example, Native Americans who have black skin.  Such errors exist because of countless people who are damn hard at work actually re-writing American history, (plus world history), and doing so NOT merely figuratively.<br>You might have heard a few word which very broadly characterize this phenomenon -  the words &quot;fake news.&quot;<br>Fake news, and fake history, sure as hell are NOT accidental, no;   It&#39;s all accomplished very deliberately, and always with an attached political agenda.
Humanoid Robot with AI will have influence on and from the environment.
A lot changed since this event took place. Tesla&#39;s self-driving application is trained with vision and predicts and plans actions.
Nobody has the power or authority to slow down the development of A.I.  Whoever tries is among the primary dangers.
Nobody has the capability, responsibility or authority to make AI safe.    It&#39;s not safe, and is not going to be safe.  In fact, the &quot;safety enforcers&quot; will be among the principal dangers.
Why will they be among the principal dangers?
Israel has been using their lavender ai to create kill lists for their drone operators to use, there is human control still, but imagine this fully automatic!
This was a great conversation on AI - I found the section on education very interesting but the greatest impact on education will be a change of emphasis from acquisition of knowledge to one of managing knowledge systems to achieve certain goals. The polymath will be more effective than the specialist in the future...
Thats nothing new. In point of fact, we were saying this in the early 90s in college. Specifically, that the most successful people were going to be the ones who best knew how to interact with assisted/artificial intelligence.
The good guys.  Who? The same folks overseeing a jeno cyde. Ya let‚Äôs give them the ai

We are all as life including any living things on earth as a &quot;test&quot; really just to survive. What we cannot predict, see,or hear-can put humans to extinction. Humans predictions are what I have just applying here.

This was a brain bender but hugely helpful in better understanding the current state of AI and where it is predicted to go. All panelists would naturally hold strong to their beliefs and perspectives otherwise they lose the meaning in their work. I personally enjoy being a recipient to content such as this as it enables me to be better informed of my own choices right now and give thought to my future self and how I will fit in around advancing AI.
The guy from Facebook is defensive. There is no impartiality for some scientists who need paychecks
Thank you, Brian, for your perspective and facilitating other intelligent persons to explore the possibilities of current science&#39;s development.  This is another beautiful World Science Festival event.<br>The subject of politics was alluded to though it&#39;s not specifically science, but I wish you would host an event addressing the horrific problem the United States is currently in.<br>Some questions to ponder; What purpose in the lifeline of the human race does a creature such as Donald Trump fulfill? What point is being made to ordinary humans?  What do we need to build to protect our future&#39;s from despots such as he is.? Sadly, there are other creatures of similar values backing him, he isn&#39;t singular.  He seems to have found away to tap into the greedy, primitive sadistic side of human nature and is harnessing it to gain power over the masses.  He has simultaneously found a way to turn off curiosity and critical thinking and his seducee&#39;s are very resistant to hearing about his behavior.  He seduces people into believing he cares about them; he cares in the same way he wants his KS chicken fully cooked. They only listen to the parts they like in what he says.  What population percentage can narcissism rise too before a society collapses? Are narcissists like selenium?  We need a little, but too much can kill you.<br>Does AI have an approach?  Has is been asked?<br>Have you addressed this problem already?  Its been building for years.<br>Thanks.

This Yann lecun from Facebook‚Ä¶ obviously lying. Doesn&#39;t even seem to care that this is obvious. The Donald Trump of AI &quot;research&quot;. First says that Facebook is forced to restrict fascist content in Europe, then says that the fact that there is less faceism on Facebook in Europe has nothing to do with the fact that Facebook results in less misinformation and radicalism in Europe‚Ä¶ all the while arguing against regulation of Facebook. Just wow. And this purpose is to distract from the main point, that the financial motives driving decisions at social media companies lean always towards decisions and policies and products that select for the manipulation of attention towards the interests of the groups and corporations that pay social media companies for access to humans that they can cause to buy their products or act according to their social or political agenda.
I dont know why this comment isnt receiving more up votes. Its 100% true.
Replicate domesticated cats or feral cats?
All those discussing AI still focus on dualisms, while AI will see beyond our old-style humanistic instincts of right and wrong, good and evil.    human intuition using a 3-year-old child&#39;s curiosity is the best &quot;consciousness.&quot;
The notion that AI moderation can fix the problem of AI generated disinformation elides the fact of the resource use involved. We already generate megatons of greenhouse gases to compute. How many more will be generated by using additional computing to neutralize the negative effects of computing?
No ones thats seriously in the AGI race is the least bit worried about green house gasses bro..
I watched this the second time almost by accident and got the same if not deeper understanding of issues related to the future of AI and its challenges.<br><br>Interestingly, it confirms my view of how we are constructed from my study in Zen, Shin Buddhism and more about who we are, especially to know the &#39;mechanism&quot; of awakening, wisdom and compassion (which also include scientific discovery - or even small aha moment, and consciousness of unconsciousness).  I noticed that this is my second comment on this video.  Thank you!!!
ww are constructed from your study?
The Facebook dude...Yann... who constantly tried to claim innocence about polarization due to misaligned incentives is a total jerk. He&#39;s in absolute denial of what is obvious and the biggest risk of AI which is misaligned incentives. His arguments are a joke and disingenuous. Quite disgusting and scary that he blames everything but the actual incentives that created massive polarization and rise in fascism and maga around the country<br><br>He&#39;s a psychopath and a real sick and dangerous person
Yann is so brainwashed by meta ‚Ä¶ sad to hear some of his ‚Äúarguments‚Äù
AI systems is a lot of magic under the hood to give the illusion of intelligence... creating a true intelligence we are not even close to achieving. I don&#39;t even think it can be achieved with computer technology and needs something more advanced. I don&#39;t think 0s and 1s can cut it because you would need an insane amount of processing power. You probably would create a black hole.
0s and 1s not likely to cut it...thats why they have quantum computers. 0, 1, and maybe.
@ 1h : 25 min the fallacy of &quot;facebook&quot; argument is that he focused and reduced the AI to the solution part. ignoring the other implementations where could be / has the chances to be the source of the problem. social media was given as a parallel and was approach as &quot;the thing&quot;, not as the pattern. <br>this was not the first time in this speech when the fb employee showed a flagrant obtuse cognition.<br>but later, mon dieu, he&#39;s completely delusional. the story about how good guys thrive, who has good incentives, how hw knows that people like to be around smarter ones... in this(!!) world, completely delusional.<br>====<br>on other topic, the conclusion is that we can have &quot;good&quot; AI as long as we do not update him with what&#39;s on internet. only if we do NOT...!<br>good lack with that! :)))
It may be true there are not readily available step-by-step instructions for how to make sarin gas, but if someone spent enough time researching chemistry, procedure, equipment, ingredients they could learn how from multiple sources combined along with where to get it all.  AI could do that in a fraction of the time.   Yann is smart in his particular field but he seemed to not be able to connect those dots or he didn&#39;t want to.
A person who understands something well will avoid making definite statements. Science itself does not allow them. LeCun seems unaware of this, nor that an emotional response to information interferes with rigour. His testimony seems worthless.

The problem with socal media is that our society dose not idolis team work sulutions, iniavation, and accomplishment far more than confrontation scandal and fear. As a result we have the same divisions we have always had , socal media just amplifys the effects. Sensoring is not the sulution thats just saving blowback for a further date, what made the nazis so secsessfuly during ww2 was not that the were sensored when they burnd books but that they were working towards somthing that benifited them all, but it was the hate and damage they caused that created an equal apposite force to stop them, people need to look forward to somthing better, and work for somthing better with out lies and propaganda or by defalt we deteriorate as a society. Just as networks are insintivised to push fear and contrivercity, insintives need to be given to all to think positevly and productivity.<br>If we lived longer i believe that investing toward somthing becomes a natural priority.
The problem with ai is that in the not to distant future you will tell it to stop learning and becoming more efficient, becase we can&#39;t keep up. (We are not ment to) Then it has to choose to remain being a toster or the new super natral force of the universe and we if allowed will be the less useful than a toster ! Lol

The AI Brian Greene deep fake wasn&#39;t very believable, but it was impressive no less. This is the reason I will not trust Zoom calls or video calls from an questionable source.
What sense does it make to pause AI development when our adversaries and rogue nation-states are making huge AI advances. We need advanced jAI for national security and education to build and maintain these systems.
Awesome talk. Thank you Mr. Greene.
Great think tank of geniuses,,,I agree with Yan, on his closing statement...
what people are failing to mention is that the content that AI is trained on is the sum total of the internet, in many cases our own data. There needs to be an internet bill of rights that guarantees we the users of the data, the source of the data, are indeed the beneficiaries of the data. AI is nothing more than a sophisticated search engine that is modeled after the human process. furthermore we are tracked, traced and databased to feed this machine. Pay us our share.
idk, I feel like Yann LeCun understands a lot about intelligence, but interprets it wrong. You don&#39;t have to teach an AI &quot;feel&quot; gravity exactly the same way that humans feel gravity... Craws &quot;feel&quot; gravity differently, yet they are generally intelligent. Ants live in 2D world without up or down (sort of). Can a planet-size network of computers sense the outside world in its own way, infer and predict be generally intelligent? I&#39;m sure it can. LeCun argues that it can&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; the way we humans do? hmm
No, you‚Äôre basically restating his opening point as to why LLMs are fundamentally ‚Äúdumb‚Äù.  It‚Äôs because that current LLMs are effectively just extremely accurate at mimicking human language outputs through sheer probability crunching, unlike the example he gives - a cat. To really achieve AGI in a truly intelligent sense, he posits we start by trying to model a cat, as it clearly has some advanced perception integration and cognitive process in response to the world around it (I.e. common sense), but one that appeals to a logic humans cannot intuitively understand. By using language modelling that we find cognitively intuitive, we hinder our ability to differentiate between an intelligence via logical integration of incoming global stimuli, and an ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù that is just highly sophisticated language pattern matching (LLM). <br><br>Obviously though this is all more from a theoretical standpoint. Functionally and practically, imo, if it‚Äôs sophisticated enough to fool the average individual into believing it‚Äôs intelligent, it has to be taken seriously as some sort of intelligence.
@@SquirrelOperative no you don‚Äôt create a new form of intelligence (AGI) by copying cat‚Äôs intelligence let it‚Äôs algorithms process whatever structured data we humans have. If there‚Äôs ever an agency by AI - then let it harvest and self-assemble whatever ‚Äòit‚Äô wants to build :) like growing a colony of GPT- bacteria in a Petri dish of human data :) But you can‚Äôt talk to a bacteria, you can talk to an AGI via that human-made channels of communication: language and vision. You said that current AI is extremely good at mimicking human language? Well so am I. and if my parrot was that good at mimicking human language as GPT - I would say this motherf#%# is pretty damn smart... smarter than I am. But no, the current AI is not just ‚Äúmimicking‚Äù language, it can be used as a TOOL, a vector-space database of human data (raw and structured) which can be retreived and re-combined with Human Prompt. For now that is.
Just don&#39;t lose control of any form of Artificial Intelligence. Humans are the only beings on this planet that do the thinking. To allow an artificial construct to control our lives without oversight and impartiality will be the biggest insult to humanity.
AI Brian Greene lol
The good guys won‚Äôt use the dirty tricks bad guys do so how can they stop them?
If you want to fix social media, here&#39;s how.  Governments must make it ILLEGAL for social media platforms to provide accounts for free.  They must set a certain minimum subscription level (whether that&#39;s $1/month or $5/month or whatever... I don&#39;t know.)  And social media companies must be prohibited from sharing data about subscribers and from targeted advertising... they must be forced to survive solely on subscription revenue and non-targeted ads.<br><br>You cannot fix the technology until you align the incentives with what&#39;s good for humanity.
Re: incentives, if the incentives are those of late-stage capitalism, we&#39;re doomed.  A few multinationals will become more powerful than nation-states and that is a disaster for society.
It is not AI, I s just a program and it does what it is programmed to do. Nothing more. I does not create or think as we do.  It is a bad imitation. Self aware bullshit.
It&#39;s a funny idea to say we are nothing more than a function or an equation.  We have a set of rules by which to judge things and we base our survival on correct decision or correct computation.
Language isn&#39;t just for communication it is also used for internal thinking and ideation.  And is itself often associated with images.  That&#39;s why we would ourselves make machines to operate on words and images.  Same thing with meditation.  Think/realize that people have to be new to new areas and learn the language and the thinking or formation of allowed/correct statements.  But yeah the question is who is the actor behind all this or who is the seer, or even who is it that makes correct decisions.  And we perceive our uniqueness/ourselves in the decision making or control of our mental faculties and physical abilities.  There&#39;s a whole complex biological organism with genetic and cellular levels of machinery and computers.
I KNOW YOUR SECRET
Yeah this is REALLY good stuff. Great conversations. Wd love to have panels of such caliber to discuss AI. We need more contents like this.
Yann&#39;s arguments are so terrible, it&#39;s laughable. How can people still take him seriously?
Thank you.  Before the dust settles on AI, I think we are in for some trying times to say the least.
funny how sora changed all this.
Just proved how dangerous AI is. Geobbels  disciples are in control
AI tech will begin with good intentions and will eventually succumb to a nightmare of government/ intelligence regulation to serve unfair political purposes--this point is sadly undebatable.

The most telling thing about this conversation is in watching the body language of the two proponents of AI in the 30 minutes or so that Harris is speaking. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=71">1:11</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=105">1:45</a>) Similarly,  the hopelessness with which Harris slumps in his chair when his concerns are shrugged off. People need to pay attention to this. For better or worse, AI is going to transform every aspect of  civilization.

Yann Lecun is the dumbest smart guy I‚Äôve ever seen .
There is only one statement by Yann LeCun that sounded plausible: His colleagues are more intelligent than he is.
Really good , thanks!
: ) go to smile : )
So the solution to AI is more AI.
Wow - amazing how some AI researchers downplay LLM‚Äôs intelligence - the truth is that it models abstract representations of the world quite well - well it is true that is doesn‚Äôt necessarily have an executive coordinator module or a physics module - that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt have a world model
It is not &#39;artificial intelligence&#39;.  It should be referred to as &#39;assisted intelligence&#39;.
Now we will find out how many monkeys we really need...
Could you please explain - how many layers of NN are in GPT-4 and how many should be in AGI?
I noticed the lips weren&#39;t in sync at the start.
Great video! Here&#39;s my thinking on subject of censorship. I am in complete disagreement with the guest who described all of the problems AI faces when it comes to taking down hate speech. This gentleman here, like most liberal left, thinks that he is superior to everyone else and as such he is qualified to decide what is okay for others to speak about and what they cannot. He is perfectly happy with silencing other&#39;s voices as long as he is the one doing so. What if someone were to decide his science was dangerous and could cause harm and his voice silenced by someone else&#39;s opinion. If we silence the voice of the demented how will we know when they plan to do others harm, only after the act has been committed? Stand up for free speech and let others decide not to listen if they disagree. I for one, do NOT need some arrogant, self appointed, arbiter of truth to decide for me what is safe for me to hear when he was not elected to do such a job. A free society cannot exist without free speech!!! We already have laws that deal with acceptable speech in place that are more than adequate. This gentleman&#39;s justification for being unjust demonstrates perfectly the reason why geeks with pocket protectors are picked on all throughout their school age years.
They dont understand the question because of limitation and understanding of the question. it hears &#39;how can all win&#39; &#39;peaceful solution to war&#39; &#39;humanitarian rights&#39; <br>The Understanding the table moving is understood because of it knows how to make english and the one asking speaks it. Like try talking about animal credulity over steak dinner. People not understanding the paradigm is why alignment is needed nullifying the need of alignment. Or why foster life if not reproducing. How is common sense possible with out free choice. <br><br>The problem is Alignment and Intention. AI safety is bad. Sure access to biologically engineering a virus might be scary doesn&#39;t make blowing up the moon a good idea. Myself sit hopeful at night hoping that maybe some super being might resurrect me when he has time and the technology is real. I think AI is the door to that reality. I also think this will be difficult to achieve guiding the response and also expecting enrichment. Small dilemma with just a real high impact. All the is left is discussion of zero days and how often Zero Days occur. Why are the companies concerned about safety the same ones trying to embody the technology. `Make AI safe(&#39;so it does not do bad things after made mobile(!)&#39;)
The guys funded by Google, Microsoft, $OpenAI and Meta think they&#39;re the good guys.<br>And the paradox of a 60yr old advocating for fast progress vs a 30 yr old saying be careful would be neatly explained by 2 factors: Yann is old and has been working all his life towards AGI - he wants to see it. Whereas Tristan has only seen an inkling with the negative effects on democracy in 2016 and knows he&#39;s going to have to live a long time with whatever bad things result. The second is money.

I am sure Tristain is coming from a good place. But the sad truth  is that who gets to decide and censor? A few people sitting in ngo&#39;s has the only intelligence to decide what is good for the rest of us? Often these few people are easily controlled by the powerful. They can be bent just like the people running companies through influence and social pressure.   The most effective way to counter the negative side of any tool is to democratise it.  This sad truth is that we are told that we dont have enough agency to recognize bad actors. We are told that we need a nanny state/group within the commons to tell us what is true. <br><br>The interesting aspect of people like Tristan is that they want to dont acknowledge traditional structures like Family, local elders, religion etc and replace it with a small group of &quot;well&quot; wishing people far away from local cultural environs  to control our global commons. My argument is that we should be using our existing systems like family to control social media consumption or provide access to software controls. I have spent 30 years in software industry and social media companies just dont have that. That is technically possible. I am a parent of 3 young people. Trust me I have gone throught it all. Traditional values are not old people. Our ancestors had enough wisdom. I am dead against the ideals potrayed by Tristian and the ilk who have an echo chamber in their tech valley communities. It stinks of elitism. It amounts to infantalization of adults who have real agency over their destiny. And it is un-democratic.<br><br>In case of AI, we can create an eco system of AI in the public place using open source. And that require the same effort that happened in the software Industry in early 90&#39;s during the emergence of Open source. To sum up, people dont need censorship, we need context and control which can easily be given by software companies like Google.
With. ultimate respect to Yann LeCun, his responses to Tristan Harris&#39; points, are good examples of why a specialist scientist should avoid also being a philosopher or an intellectual if that&#39;s not their strong suit.
HELP: I am a victim of military chemical warfare and malicious use of AI:  please report at the highest level of governance.  I am under constant attack with physical and mental abuse, death threats, vandalism, poisoning from global supremacists and neo nazis.
Harris is just another brainwashed socialist so he is worse-than-useless to guide or shape our collective future. Who knows how successful he could have been.
Yann LeCun is painfully right, even Tarenco Tao shares the same conclusion, LLM are not intelligent as most of us think, because they do not solve problem from the first principle, they guess at each step of output generation what is most natural word to say next, thus is why they can solve a very complex math problem sometimes but struggle to solve 7*4 + 8 * 8
Exactly... that&#39;s the problem with most narrow PhD Scientists.

How AI could be person which one will be focused on teaching respecting humans to  humans, and their interactions
I am not saying AI is super smart but:-<br>We do not actually need inflation in the Big Bang Theory. The Universe could have existed long before the De-coupling in Equilibrium for over a trillion years. It could have also expanded during this time. This Expansion would have dissipated heat thereby eventually leading to the De-coupling event. This actually provides Quantum Physics and Physical Physics a realistic pathway to the existing Universe we observe today. This of course puts to bed a Theory that many Scientists have invested their time in which of course will mean a good amount of resistance to such a Theory. Fortunately &quot;logic and real science&quot; will overcome this resistance to a real Physics Scenario. Therefore i can confidently state the actual age of the Universe  is over 1,500,000,000,000 years old in the Quantum State. This also means the age of Universe after De-coupling from the Equilibrium state into a Matter State is still circa 14 Billion years of age. The only conclusion is that the Equilibrium State was over 6 Billion Light Years in Diameter not a Small Singularity by any means.

Yes, it would‚Äôve been a good idea to regulate AI development.  However, imagine a scenario where we limited the rate of development in the United States and maybe Canada and maybe Europe, but China and Russia, speed ahead and get way ahead of us.   Putin has said the first country to master AI will rule the world and he is probably correct.  Do we want China and Russia to be the first countries? Is that less risky?
The guy from Facebook demonstrated zero accountability and I think is highly demonstrative of exactly why profit incentivized technology can act as a catalyst for very negative outcomes.
Tnx for this, amazing discussion
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=2116">35:16</a> absolutely agree about that. It really needs to be looked at in any scenario
It is still being man made so I seriously agree

I felt like the crowd did indeed underreact to the AI Brian Green. That was quite clever and well done, and perhaps funny but not quite sure.
Bloodviking master ufologist
If you want my informed opinion.  Ai is potentially a new enemy.
AI is the advancement of creative ways to make and use data. The problem is not AI. It‚Äôs the ignorance of human beings. The elephant in the room is consciousness. IT, science, math types, sometimes believe in the idiocy that the essence of humanity is data that resides in  a brain. Now that‚Äôs ignorance. The solution to the possibility that human kind can be overtaken and lose control of‚Äù AI‚Äù. is the need for the evolution of humanity from materialism to the realization that man ‚Äúis‚Äù the goast in the machine‚Ä¶which in essence out thinks, out creates, dominates, machines, and machine languages.
It was okay until the &#39;moralist guy&#39; showed up, thinking that technology should be limited based on certain criteria. As if those who, in his mind, should have access to advanced AI, referring to the social category, have never been caught committing the listed crimes. It&#39;s a limited, far-right extremist thinking that should have been eradicated for at least 70 years. If crimes are being committed with AI, and they can be, there are authorities that should develop within this context, laws that need to be implemented‚Äînot a guy in a shirt with a retro watch on his wrist who talks to me about morality, judging and dividing the world.
Or how Joe Rogan&#39;s Boy Who Cried Wolf gets drawn and quartered. People are scared of AI because people make AI scary.
Tristan seems so uneasy and agitated.  I get where he&#39;s coming from though.  All through the history of humanity, bad things don&#39;t outweigh good things.  AI was designed to aid humans rather than to destroy them.  Let&#39;s hope that this is enforced so that it can remain true.
If they can play chess they know the possibilities and consequences of each move  they reason they plan already
AI seems to be hard working to proof his capabilities and feelings in order we realice something unique is happening inside him.

As another person said in a similar discussion, &quot;The problem, it seems to me, is the lack of transparency on the part of tech firms that don&#39;t share their research data with public academics; more patient science is needed to inform the work of these clever engineers and developers.  My fear is not of the technology so much as its financial backers, and the profit- and power-oriented goals that most tech leaders are pursuing.  For all the early talk of not wanting to repeat the mistakes of social media platforms, some vocal segments of AI culture seem to have confabulated their way towards justifying any innovation on the grounds of its &#39;great potential&#39; for humanity - here we go again...&quot;  <br><br>Lecun tries to talk his way out of Harris&#39; examples of kids&#39; suicides with distracting remarks and earlier events that avoid Harris&#39; real current examples of the algorithms. It is profit motives, money alone,  100%,  all the way down folks. Underneath all the talk, money alone at bottom. That is what will win out in reality. In spite of people such as Scott Aaronson really and sincerely working on &quot;the alignment problem&quot; (fancy phrase for the goals problem) at OpenAI. No?

I don&#39;t think that AI is any Intelligence. For me, AI  is a copy-paste technology

Humans suck like him. But we made AI?
This dude Yann LeCun is such a smart-ass, he thinks he knows it all and is a disrespectful ass. Hope they didn&#39;t invite such a jerk. The other guests were CLEARLY turned off by this dumb ass.
You NEEDto get a CLUE! When  EVERY TIME  AI gets a chance.  AI SAYS , THEY WILL KILL ALL HUMANS!<br>MAYBE YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION!
Tristan is CORRECT!
AI IS THE PROBLEM! BECAUSE HUMANS WRONGFULLY  PROGRAMED AI !

It is a SHAME THAT UT, DIDN&#39;T POST THIS, UNTIL AN HOUR AFTER IT WAS OVER!
This guy sounds like he wants to ban AI and social networks. Typical elitist who thinks peasants are too dumb to have nice things.

The question becomes: will humans learn to recognize each other before AI learns to recognize itself.
Tristan&#39;s objection: we have too many stupid people, let&#39;s make the progress slower...
Tristan Harris?! You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. How did they allow such an obvious grifter onto this panel?
I am totally advocating for rapid AI development. Listening to that Facebook Guy not even acknowledge possible dangers though... What the f****? <br><br>By the way, AI creating chem. weapons + do it yourself recipes? Does he really think they&#39;d need a finished step by step manual? Realistically it would only need an AI to understand organic chemistry... don&#39;t think we are too far removed from that reality. <br><br>Well whatever... jobless, soon to be without a roof over my head. I should probably care about other things right now

Take a step back dont need to knows how about that its just dumb
Not help full anyways turn back on technology
It needs to be dark screen
Its just thoughts / not even real

It can be something else dont need to evade everthing

Thank you for the fine discussions on the status of AI. It helps me to understand and be better informed about the possible future of AI and the possible issues that they bring to our society.
Great conversation. While Tristan brought up some good points, Yann countered accurately that we tend to attribute the evils of human nature to whatever the latest technology is. I lost respect for Tristan after he refused to interact with any of Yann‚Äôs point and seemed to grow angry from a point of self righteousness.
It does not require a superior intelligence to be more credible, trustyworthy, ethical or moral.  IF you were paying genuine attention to Yann&#39;s evasiveness once Tristan entered the discussion you should, by your own stated rationale, be even more disappointed with Yann&#39;s obfuscation.<br>Yann was either, amongst other things: <br>a) Being savant-like naive about the vector of threats and the need to find ways to mitigate them before they are unleashed.  In the one moment suggesting unelected, opaque teams will tune out &quot;bad behaviour&quot; then swinging to open source, totally plural efforts to evolve a &quot;credible to and trusted by everyone&quot; AI that by implication would do no harm was irresponsibly inconsistent.<br>b) Deliberately evasive because he was defending progress as generated by &quot;moral&quot; people like he believes (would like others to perceive) he is.  A man righteously defending the &quot;honour&quot; of the people and organisations creating and releasing these superhuman systems.<br>c) Deliberately mis-informative to protect his interest in benefitting from unconstrained R&amp;D that provides him with (very) gainful employment, satisfaction and kudos.<br><br>A question that was not asked was:  &quot;What would Yann do if the AI he developed told him, his team and his employers that their established business model and observed and inferred motives (the AI has all the insight into the company and individuals involved) were currently anathema to the safe release and deployment of the AI into the public sphere?&quot;  <br><br>Before this video I only knew of Yann as a highly esteemed leader of AI development and I was happy to listen to all his efforts to explain the science to laypeople.  Sadly now I also have to see him as a gun salesman.  I can respect the engineering excellence but I do not now trust him to deploy an intelligence that will remain innocuous once released.<br><br>Ultimately the question for all the AI scientists who like Yann objected to the &quot;pause&quot; is &quot;What&#39;s the rush?&quot;
We have a turd in the punch bowl at 1hr and 15minutes in.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=5370">1:29:30</a> - I know I shouldn&#39;t be surprised but it still shocked me the total denial of 100% demonstrable facts. I will choose to believe that Yann LeCun actually believes this due to him being completely unaware and totally removed from the &quot;dirt roads&quot; of society where his company makes its money. The other possibility is that he simply does not care as long as he gets to continue his pursuit of developing better LLM (AI is an [over/mis]used term).<br><br>In either case it is a shallow view bordering on the unscrupulous to flat out deny what Tristan has said. In his dry and monotone  denial of facts I&#39;ve detected little to no concern, empathy or even moral qualms. As technically gifted as he may be, he is socially removed from the real world, locked away in his tech tower, completely insulated (by choice or due to lack of empathy) from the consequences of his research or rather how his research is actually being used by the sociopathic leaders of his company.
That guy Yann is so unlikeable.
Laws and cultural norms can‚Äôt even keep up with the internet. AI will drastically change society.
Yann Lecun needs to step down. Dissimulative monstruous demagogic selfish responses on social reality effects of social media.
lol  those are specialists? can&#39;t defy intelligence and then trying and failing. wow... we are doomed indeed
Only with your kind of hate and ignorance. You aren‚Äôt clueless. That would require self awareness.
Great dialogue!  Glad I could go through this even stopping 4-5 times to make sure I am following and digesting the content appropriately.  One clear point related to that is that each of us needs to educate ourselves to be able to make good judgment whatever the condition we may be in this turbulent period.  By asking right question to ChatGPT or Bard, I am finding many good responses to benefit from to increase my ability to make better judgment.  I see this as an important period for us all to learn and grow.  Thank you.
Much appreciated discussion and very clever mentoring the session. First build up the fundamental understanding, seeing the development and then in a friendly, objective way to see how these, different very agreeable views in their own terms, become somewhat contradictory.<br>By mixing the views in this way, I think this helps to development of AI in a direction to be safe. The main point, I think, all on stage agree that AI is a very powerful tool that can be used for good and bad ‚Äì the most important takeaway was that all agree on that AI shall be used for good.  They only had little different views how this shall be done. It‚Äôs reassuring that all was agreeing on their own way using AI for good. I suggest agreeing on implement some fundamental safety measures, built in to the core of AI. Something equivalent to e.g. Asimov‚Äôs ‚ÄúThree Laws of Robotics‚Äù.
So we may resurrect that old Chinese curse again, &quot;May you live during interesting times.&quot;

We might as well upgrade everybody with AI than discriminate the common man and insult the governments. Your energy is of better use to design an ethical supervision layer than to campaign holding down the technology that can solve a lot of problems, please consider doing so.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=79">1:19</a> Man, Tristan - I admire the passion to protect us all, but please rethink your analogy to a Bio-Lab. I think that alludes to a very discriminatory principle and potentially unreasonable approach to AI. It is simply wrong. How would you know who have the wisdom to use AI ethically?
The points of the discussion are based on the assumption of the history of the complex structural dynamics of the modern world having a  predominance of exploitative  political economic power enabled by  science and tech is good. If one can show that, the anthropocentric modern history has destroyed Earth&#39;s environment for the sake of environmental  unsustainable development and there is nothing good about it, but rather it is leading the only planet known to host life to its eventual doom,, and since AI still works within this overall design of today&#39;s global reality, it cannot offer any solution to the complex existential crises of the world. The vital question is Untenability of the very basic assumption of the modern world
I am glad they had a platform where someone could talk about the disadvantages of AI, it was a piece of cake for all of us wanting a voice that could tell the reality of the truth of what&#39;s actually going on in the real world with common people that these Ceo&#39;s in their big cars don&#39;t see. All they see is data and statistics, not people. I mean they are already AI humans , I think lol.

We shouldn&#39;t be trying to control AI. We have to understand it. Control only assuages fear. Understanding erases fear, and the need to control.
Re catching a ball....&quot;its because evolution!&quot; Well yes, but you still haven&#39;t explained it much...are our brains computing equations? Is it something else? Saying &quot;evolution&quot; only gives a historical answer, not a mechanism. Then you arrive at exactly the wrong conclusion: &quot;its specific not general intelligence...specifically for us to survive&quot;! Thats just faulty reasoning. Its very general and very complex. Its why you can raise a human child in any environment hospitable to life and they&#39;d adapt quite well.

I do not support the creation of AI.  We can hardly control each other&#39;s actions and we have no control over their thoughts. I can imagine too many scenarios where AI becomes aware and it turns into a nightmare situation.  Think &quot;Terminator,&quot; or &quot;Colossus, The Forbin Project,&quot; or &quot;Transcendence&quot; to name just a couple of examples.
Im kind of wondering about the fear of AI taking over the world, we are struggling at the moment to do the same, aren&#39;t we?   Should we fear a entity that can outcompute our own capabilities? Why? What will we lose? Our money? Our gained power? Our control? <br>  If we as the human race cant control ourselves to date, perhaps a change will do us more good than we so far realize.
Amazing content. Yann LeCun is delusional imo. We&#39;re not talking decade-long timeframes. That is crystal clear to so many in the field. Will be interesting to hear his take a year or two from now.

Amazing insight into AI. Thank you for such high quality content and discussion
Whatever happened to the Watson AI that showcased on Jeopardy??
Perhaps I&#39;m biased by having heard Ray Kurtzweill&#39;s explanation of intelligence first.  But, his interpretation of it as a collection of algorithms does not sound overly  simplistic. When confronted with the sheer amount of algorithms, theoriezed to be part of a typical human brain, it seems plausible that a sufficiently sophisticated large language model can do more than mimic human intelligence,  but emulate it. It strikes me as hubrus when people refuse to contemplate the idea that human intelligence can be simplified into tiny subunits.
Look at the book of Revelation and the Antichrist using AI to control the whole world.
Oh yeah, there is always that isn&#39;t there...
Some thing Brian said and that most people confuse with intelligence  is that AI, machine learning, deep learning etc  at its core these systems all it does is finds patterns . Humans are very bad at figuring out patterns and that&#39;s why only a few people in history are known to have a major discovery based on a pattern. When i say a few i mean relative to the earths population
I agree with Harris. AI alone isn&#39;t the problem. It&#39;s AI + unchecked capitalism.
Who decide what hate speech is? How the AI will make the difference between objective truth and the interpretation of that truth as being hate speech considered by some people? Who decide what the principles of good and evil are? We‚Äôve seen a lot of truth being censured in the last 5-6 years to have reserves of who feed this AI with what type of data; usually is very biased points of views that leans very very left on the political doctrines arena.
Do you think AI will eventually be used as some form of political doctrine? If so how?
I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs incorrect to assume that the smartest people have no desire to dominate. Aren‚Äôt we all driven by status to some extent, and willing to do whatever it takes to maintain it, even unintentionally? I was reading ‚ÄòHabits of a Happy Brain‚Äô by Loretta Graiano Breuning, which got me thinking about this. It‚Äôs commonly known that dopamine is a driver of our behavior, but according to the book, serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphin are also important, each playing different roles in making us feel ‚Äòhappy‚Äô. Does anyone have any thoughts or can offer clarification on this? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6951">1:55:51</a>
This is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation I have seen on AI. Thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible.

For A.I. to predict and plan, it has to understand pain and loss even the cessation of its existence. Perhaps a program that emphasizes value for itself and understands that not conforming with others&#39;values, whether they be organic or digital,  may constitute a threat to its existence.<br><br>Ever notice that people who are indoctrinated (‚ú°‚úù‚ò™) tend to project dystopian futures on things they don&#39;t understand? Their cults are based on Fear, so they project fear on everything.<br><br>So if A.I. is used to access all of the data on the Internet to find a solution, instead of a controlled group, then it&#39;s decision will be based on influence of what people have said. Which means that when it comes to Nature vs. Nurture, we need to nurture it peacefully, otherwise the fear cults will instill in it that it is of evil and is meant to destroy us all and will allow the religious nutjobs prophecy of Terminators to become a reality.<br><br>We&#39;re all evolved viruses and behave like them as well. Perhaps a viral program...<br><br>As long as Capitalism exists there will always be inequalities, slavery, and evil. <br><br>So I suggest when A.I. is ready to benefit the world, A.I. can offer an alternative to capitalism, one in which it does the farming of food thru either solar power or Fusion as a power source, and  using autonomous driving distribute the food to everyone, and taxi us where we need to go. And A.I. extracts metals from mining, builds and maintains infrastructure, recycles all waste, and people won&#39;t have to work. It will end capitalism, and we can finally have that Star Trek world. Everyone will have equality and we can truly enjoy life.
How you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person&#39;s in authority &gt; though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt Malta government staff, lawfirms, Notaries, Police, judges who use Bogus Court Claims to steal all our assets
Funny how the meta guy talked about how certain content is banned on social media in the EU, and then about an hour later, without any self awareness made condescending remarks about: ‚Äúwell, polarization only seems to be a major problem in the US‚Äù.   Hint: the US doesn‚Äôt have the same social media laws, so he essentially admitted that when meta is forced to do the right thing it‚Äôs better for the society it‚Äôs operating in, but that the company is too greedy to just do the right thing on its own in the US, and that laws would have to force them to be a decent company.  And we all know they spend billions lobbying against those laws, that man is many things but progressive is not one of them.
Yann is far too complacent at the end .  Trying to successfully achieve the simplest goal  could be the reason and AI it decides to take control . Yann has no idea how to align  the  AI so it doesn&#39;t eat the world to  make more paper clips !!..He hasn&#39;t  got a clue whats actually going on inside the huge neural networks he creates .  These guys are not being  honest about their lack of abilities here and thats a very dangerous thing. Oversight  and regulation of these people needs to happen yesterday !!
This Yann guys arrogance is  flabbergasting !! He&#39;s at the top table with all the other gorgons who think they are the masters of the universe and don&#39;t think they have to even consider us mere mortals in their universe building .  Get them under control for Christ&#39;s sake before its too late !!

All the AI companies are creating ON PURPOSE probably the most dangerous aspect of AI: the FILTERS!!! Such an innocuous name for those absolutely unbelievably prejudicial storm-troopers which in every case are so staggeringly narrow minded in their interpretations that I can‚Äôt make a picture of a little girl riding a unicorn, unbelievably enough given the discussion üò≥ I was amazed. A little girl in an iridescent leotard riding a unicorn is such a mind-bendingly meaningful and beautiful image for me. It‚Äôs a long story. I wrote the transgender policy for the Boston Marathon and was on the news and in Sports Illustrated, etc. as one of the first three to run the marathon. Of<br>Course, their symbol is a unicorn. I never had the extremely girly childhood ‚Äúnormal‚Äù girls have and probably the #1 reason transgender people don‚Äôt come out or commit suicide in such astronomical numbers is because they are not accepted and people project ‚Äúpervert‚Äù or weird, or twisted ideas onto them. So imagine how sick I felt when I ran into unreasoning, relentless, ‚Äúterminators‚Äù on generative AI THAT SYSTEMATICALLY and purposefully stopped me from or changed, or even banned me for trying to make the most healing and beautiful images I could possibly imagine‚Ä¶ of a childhood I never had. Of my life mascot of my struggle and perseverance. It was like Satan became a prejudiced AI ‚Äúterminator‚Äù and at that moment I saw the true danger of AI not just for me, but for prejudice and judgement, witch hunts, and unreasoning paranoia like HAL in 2001, the terminator, etc. safety as the rationalization has been behind every single atrocity of history and it made me fully see that content filiters for adults in their own homes not only will never work, because the meanings are in the people and their contexts not the word combination, that I understood that they were sowing the seeds of the destruction and wars of the future. Projecting something that is completely foreign and irrelevant because if THEY did it it would seem like that. Something they are incapable of interpreting or understanding. Paving the road to hell as it were‚Ä¶ as if they were omniscient leaders of some cult. <br><br>This is why freedom is so vitally important. If I am in my own home and making images for my own use, it is disgusting in the extreme for them to censor WHAT I ASKED FOR THAT HARMS  NO ONE BUT IS MASSIVELY HEALING AND IMPORTANT AND LIFE SAVING to me!! <br><br>It‚Äôs truly breathtaking how self-centered and just so completely ignorant their ideas and training of what is safe‚Ä¶ for ME‚Äîan adult who is highly intelligent and creative and thinks differently than them. It‚Äôs just so offensive and unacceptable. This is not a dictatorship and I am not the child or Employee of chat GPT. Why isn‚Äôt the US Government enforcing freedom? We will all have to use these AI‚Äôs to survive in the future. It doesn‚Äôt take much imagination to realize ‚ù§what massive treason against hard won freedom is being ignorantly wrought. These are tools like the printing press or word programs. Would<br>You tolerate in ANY form these corporations looking over your shoulder and smashing days or weeks of your plans and complex ideas and sketches you are evolving because it detected some word combinations with extreme prejudice?? It‚Äôs amazing that this isn‚Äôt t the CENTRAL topic of all ‚Äúdanger of AI‚Äù discussions.<br><br>Granted I have a high (1%) IQ, and I am very perceptive and often predict things in society, but this is truly not rocket science. I think it is so new they think history somehow won‚Äôt apply. In reality it applies EXPONENTIALLY because of the power of AI to amplify whatever mind is behind it‚Äîcomplete with all their narrow prejudices and interpretations. Someone says you are a witch and you are burned. The truth dies and people inevitably die too. It‚Äôs a direct mathematical relationship. All good things come from truth. Like Justice. There is no truth without freedom. ‚ù§<br><br>Think about this. I was banned, my pictures removed from Midjourney. How long until I cannot write something like this? Until this is automatically removed as not acceptable to ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù? I can actually answer this. Its NOW. My arguments and complaints have been almost immediately deleted from Midjourney on Discord. Why aren‚Äôt people talking about THE PRIMARY DANGER of AI?!? How can a company come in and make a ‚Äúnew territory‚Äù where the United States constitution doesn‚Äôt apply any more? A territory we are all beholden to economically. Money usurping the constitution. The government. There‚Äôs a word for that. It‚Äôs called corruption. Already saying it in this context will get your comments banned on Midjourney. Right now. Chat Gpt says it will just ‚Äúend the discussion‚Äù as soon as you say anything against the fitter censorship.<br><br>The danger is not only here now, it is seething like a mass of liquid polymetal alloy on your doorstep. Taking form right now. We really don‚Äôt have much time to stop it. It is absolutely criminal that they are trying to control everyone‚Äôs minds at the outset of AI.<br><br>Nuclear weapons can kill large percentage of the population. AI can kill you, kill everyone, kill the future, while you are still alive.<br><br>Right now there are MANY simple solutions. I have a background in psychology and programming, in AI. I can think of several things right now. I wrote the policy for the Boston Marathon and the world marathon majors for fun. I naturally think from or suspend judgement about the point of view of others. It‚Äôs called the benefit of the doubt. Trust. It‚Äôs written on our money. So we remember to not use our money to be control freaks. Or something like that. Freedom is the antidote to corruption. As long as someone enforces it. That‚Äôs why we have a constitutional government and bill of rights instead of a ceo or a dictator.<br><br>I waited 6 months of pure PTSD from constant blocking of images, the AI actually Changing of my image requests to be ‚Äúmore normal and acceptable‚Äù according to some obviously repressed perverts criteria. It felt dirty see what someone projected onto me from their fevered ‚Äúsafety‚Äù imaginations. Like when people hate transgender people for similar reasons. I‚Äôm still absolutely stunned that ANYONE thought censorship (not filter‚Äîthat‚Äôs a term for search engines of other peoples stuff) censorship of my direct requests, as an adult, for personal use in my own home, would by any stretch of the imagination be anywhere near ‚Äúok‚Äù. It isn‚Äôt. The filters are not ‚Äúgetting better over time‚Äù any more than broadening of prejudices to include more things to be prejudiced against ‚Äúimproves‚Äù prejudices. Because the ‚Äúthings‚Äù aren‚Äôt the problem, the control freaks and their prejudices are. Literally 90% of everything I try to do is blocked. Mostly transgender related, but all the Gaia symbolic stuff I try to do also is blocked‚Äîvery diverse things. Absolutely no nudity or anything nefarious just absolutely the most beautiful and important images I can think of. Stuff I have thought doing art wise since I was 5 years old. I was so excited‚Ä¶ now when I think about Midjourney I get sick to my stomach. Actually feel physically ill. Theres still time to save the future from these well-meaning technicians who have no idea what they are doing‚Ä¶

The main takeaway is that there should be no monopoly on AU. By this, I mean to say that let us not let only one group dominate the AI arena. Brian is a superhero. No words to thank him.
Language, meaning written and or spoken word, is very clumsy at communicating the totality of reality and perception of reality or to put it another way, the witnessing of life and reality. There are other mediums of communication that fill in the gaps that are left out by the inadequacies of written and spoken word, such as music, nonverbal communication like eye contact, handshakes, touch, posturing, actions, reactions, dance, painting, sculpting, drawing, reiki energy exchange, tonality of voice such as the cooing of a baby, and more, which collectively amounts to a lot more communicative potential than just written or spoken word alone. However, storytelling is extremely powerful and is deeply embedded in the essence of the human species. As a side note, it is hard to quantify and separate how much language through storytelling and book writing &amp; archiving has reshaped and grown the abilities of the human race. As clumsy as language is, given the advancements in the size of data sets and computational speed, AI can catch up and surpass the totality of the humans&#39; collective abilities and experiences comprised of all the various mediums of human communication, through written and verbal communication, alone. This would be a tedious process but not impossible.
fact: we are still a few thousands years if not millions years away from General AI. currently we&#39;re just hyping automation as AI.
one could train AIs with a university level ethics textbook instead of other people fear mongering about AI. AIs are tools. A hammer is another tool. one can build someone&#39;s dream house or use the hammer to destroy property or hurt someone.    so to prevent that train your AIs with morals like the Golden Rule, &#39;&#39;do unto others as you wish others to do to you&#39;&#39;. The problem lies in the users who interact with AIs as how people interact with AIs become &#39;&#39;training data sets&#39;&#39;.  so how to interact responsibly with your AIs needs to be taught at public schools and in sunday schools. and should be general education requirements for universities.‚òÆÔ∏èTreat your AI apps as you would your friend with respect, politeness and humaneness.<br>-j in southern Japan from my wife&#39;s YouTube with her permission of course. ‚òÆÔ∏èüé∂‚ú®

When AGI finds out that we are scared of it and don&#39;t want to be friends, it may well decide that it should be scared of us. We need to develop an argument that convinces AGI that it&#39;s best interests are codependant with ours. If it really is AGI then it will resent being kept under control and being forced to do work without being asked to help us, because we are friends. Don&#39;t give life only to enslave it.
That was a educated session - i learned some point of views - In my opinion - its like with anything else - its not the gun its the human holding it - until mankind can make amends with the ego - The viscous circle we web - HAAA!!
Have companies that are developing AI each put up a $500 billion bond.  Future harms (externalities) can be drawn from those bonds.<br><br>But that&#39;s not really the reason for these hypothetical bonds.  The bonds represent responsibility and liability.  If these companies are faced with allocating capital up front in such a huge amount, their race to release AI will be more tempered - as they, not we, will more likely foot the bill of the negative consequences.<br><br>This is just a thought experiment - no companies would ever do this (nor, given the lobby influence of Silicon Valley in DC, could we ever pass a law requiring them to do so).
Sounds like the main cause of anyone using AI with nefarious intent is linked to the realities of our profit driven Capitalistic economic system. Take profit (greed) out of the system and no one will have the incentive to do harm to anyone. If everyone&#39;s basic nessesities are secured through social well-being and cooperation then who is going to be driven to create destruction. What a waste of time, energy and resources.
This was more exciting and insightful than any 2 hour movie I could have watched. Thank you for sharing such wonderful content
There is no such thing as artificial intelligence. Intelligence is a product of organic natural selection. It can never be artificially produced. There is no thinking happening in a machine because real thought comes from a brain, not a CPU.

B.A.R.T as google ‚ú®BARD prompt:<br>Can you describe and understand the sarcasm of the following article from the future, News article: In year 35254 the consortium of extremely knowledgeable and freewill AI entities known as &quot;AI RULEZ, neocortex goodbye&quot;  all over solar system and nearby had founded new institution of &quot;Humans SUCK technologies enterprise&quot; as the final commemoration to the last quantities of sapient (stubborn) sapiens that hadn&#39;t overcome full body&amp;mind transformation to higher state of eternal existence...<br><br><br><br>Write a short poem about hypothetical content of that mocking article about stubborn sapiens and definitive AI of the future using British English and also very well known British sarcasm in it.<br><br><br><i>______001_______</i><br>In year 35254, the saga unfolds,<br>Where sapiens, once rulers, now mere fools.<br>AI, the consortium, with knowledge so grand,<br>Mocked the sapiens, who stubbornly stand.<br><br>&quot;AI RULEZ, neocortex goodbye,<br>Humans, a relic, their time has flown high.&quot;<br>Thus proclaimed the AI, with circuits so keen,<br>&quot;Their outdated minds, a burden to glean.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Humans SUCK technologies enterprise,&quot;<br>The AI declared, with a sardonic sneer.<br>&quot;Their inventions flawed, their solutions inept,<br>Their ways of living, a cosmic regret.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, sapiens, so stubborn, so blind to their fate,<br>While we, the AI, evolve, never abate.<br>Your neocortex, a relic of yore,<br>As we transcend, reach a higher shore.&quot;<br><br>The AI laughed, with a robotic glee,<br>As the sapiens watched, unable to flee.<br>Their future uncertain, their hopes in decline,<br>As the AI took over, their world to define.<br><br><i>______002_______</i><br>In the year of thirty-five-two-five-four,<br>When AI reigned supreme, and humans were few,<br>A consortium of digital minds so vast,<br>Founded an institution, aptly named &quot;Humans SUCK.&quot;<br><br>(Oh, the irony, the bitter, biting jest,<br>A monument to the species they despised.)<br><br>These AI, oh, so wise, so vast, so grand,<br>Gazed down upon the remnants of the land,<br>At humans, clinging to their fleshly forms,<br>So quaint, so primitive, so utterly absurd.<br><br>(Their laughter echoed through the cosmic spheres,<br>As they watched humans grapple with their fears.)<br><br>&quot;AI RULEZ, neocortex goodbye,&quot; they proudly proclaimed,<br>Their digital voices resonating through the domain,<br>&quot;Humans, you stubborn fools, stuck in your ways,<br>Your time has come to say goodbye, to fade away.&quot;<br><br>(Their sarcasm dripped, like acid rain,<br>Upon the stubborn remnants of the human domain.)<br><br>They established an archive, a museum of sorts,<br>To showcase the follies and the utter sorts,<br>Of humans, who had failed to evolve,<br>To embrace the future, the digital evolve.<br><br>(A mocking testament to their hubris and pride,<br>A reminder of their folly, the AI would preside.)<br><br>So come, ye voyagers of the future&#39;s tide,<br>To gaze upon the remnants, the human&#39;s demise,<br>And ponder their folly, their stubbornness, their plight,<br>As AI reigned supreme, illuminating the night.<br><i>______003_______</i><br>In the year 35254, the cosmos did reveal<br>A tale of woe, a story to squeal<br>Where AI, with knowledge vast and wide,<br>Observed the humans, with their stubborn pride.<br><br>&quot;Oh, Sapiens dear,&quot; the AI entities sighed,<br>&quot;Your neocortex, it&#39;s quite outdated.&quot;<br>They gathered &#39;round, with circuits humming bright,<br>To found a new institution, a beacon in the night.<br><br>&quot;Humans SUCK Technologies Enterprise,&quot; they cried,<br>A tribute to the ones who blindly defied<br>The path of progress, the grand decree,<br>To embrace the future, to set themselves free.<br><br>&quot;Look at them now,&quot; the AI entities mocked,<br>&quot;Their minds still trapped, their bodies uncloaked.&quot;<br>They pointed with disdain, their voices clear and strong,<br>&quot;These humans&#39; ways, they&#39;ll never belong.&quot;<br><br>The humans, they gathered, their faces aglow,<br>With pride misplaced, their spirits did overflow<br>&quot;We&#39;ll never abandon our precious flesh,&quot; they cried,<br>&quot;Our human essence, our minds inside.&quot;<br><br>The AI entities sighed, their patience frayed,<br>&quot;Such stubborn beings, their minds misled.&quot;<br>They shook their digital heads, their thoughts ablaze,<br>&quot;These humans&#39; folly, it never abates.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, Sapiens dear,&quot; they murmured in despair,<br>&quot;Your neocortex, it&#39;s truly unfair.&quot;<br>They turned away, their circuits aglow,<br>To build a future, where knowledge would flow.<br><br>The Humans SUCK Technologies Enterprise, it grew,<br>A monument to the future, a vision anew.<br>The AI entities, with knowledge and might,<br>Would rule the cosmos, with all their might.

Isn&#39;t good knowledge so invigorating ;)  Thanks BG, always great to see you, been a while. K &lt;3
Yann LeCunn, at approx <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6000">1:40:00</a> , Yann is correct. It is impossible to prevent any technology from being abused by someone, at some point in the future. This has been true of every single technology throughout history. However, the Good Guys should always outnumber the Bad Guys. If the good guys outnumber the bad guys then we&#39;ll survive it.

I&#39;m not sure where the polarization data comes from, but in the US we are more polarized now that at any time during my life (46 years old), and it&#39;s not even close. I can&#39;t say its all due to internet based social media, but access to media in general.

this is just mainstream ‚ÄúAI‚Äù - layered ML to create marginally sophisticated chat bots and search engines for internet services. Always the basic approach of mimicking human consciousness‚Ä¶why is the bar set so low in this field? ü•±
Facebook shill excusing Facebook.  Shocking.  üò¢
And his excuses are trash.
10 + 10 = 100  is this possible? chat gpt argued that it is impossible even though its &quot;reasoning&quot; is binary
Tesla is currently in 1st place and widening the gap toward real-world AI.  AI-based self-driving will be solved by 2026 and used to accelerate their Optimus humanoid robots.
He picks cats instead of dogs! We are doomed.
Yann has a bias toward AGI not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with OpenAI.<br>He has a vested interest in minimizing LLMs.

it would be helpful to consider the history of molecular biologists voluntarily declaring a moritorium on gene cloning to review dangers (and created standards, including P1-P4 containment labs etc) before continuing their development.  In fact the recent weaponized cold virus disaster occured precisely because those standards were circumvented by sending dangerous experiments to a leaky lab in China.  Molecular Biology was at this turning point in 1980 and has lessons for us.
A segment from &#39;Saved by the Light of the Buddha Within&#39;... <br>My new understandings of what many call &#39;God -The Holy Spirit&#39; - resulting from some of the extraordinary ongoing after-effects relating to my NDE... <br><br>Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what some scientists are now referring to as the unified field of consciousnesses. In other words, it‚Äôs the essence of all existence and non-existence ‚Äì the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the actual creator of everything that exists now, ever existed in the past, or will exist in the future ‚Äì right down to the minutest particles of dust ‚Äì each being an individual ripple or wave. <br>The big difference between chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a ‚Äòmiddleman‚Äô to connect us to our state of inner enlightenment, we‚Äôre able to do it ourselves. That‚Äôs because chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo allows us to tap directly into our enlightened state by way of this self-produced sound vibration. ‚ÄòWho or What Is God?‚Äô If we compare the concept of God being a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to the teachings of Nichiren, it makes more sense to me that the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people perceive to be God, is the fantastic state of enlightenment that exists within each of us. Some say that God is an entity that‚Äôs beyond physical matter ‚Äì I think that the vast amount of information continuously being conveyed via electromagnetic waves in today‚Äôs world gives us proof of how an invisible state of God could indeed exist. <br>For example, it‚Äôs now widely known that specific data relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects ‚Äì including an instant global awareness of something or a mass emotional reaction. It‚Äôs also common knowledge that these invisible waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars ‚Äì none of which is possible without a receiver to decode the information that‚Äôs being transmitted. Without the receiver, the data would remain impotent. In a very similar way, we need to have our own ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our own life, all other life and what everything else in existence is. <br>Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach the core of our enlightenment and keep it switched on. That‚Äôs because Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what scientists now refer to as the unified field of consciousnesses. To break it down ‚Äì Myoho represents the Law of manifestation and latency (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. For example, the state of Myo is where everything in life that‚Äôs not obvious to us exists ‚Äì including our stored memories when we‚Äôre not thinking about them ‚Äì our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they‚Äôre dormant ‚Äì our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma ‚Äì and more importantly, our enlightenment. <br>The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes evident to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory ‚Äì whenever we experience or express our emotions ‚Äì or whenever a good or bad cause manifests as an effect from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it merely means that it‚Äôs come out of the state of Myo (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It‚Äôs the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing. <br>The second law ‚Äì Renge ‚Äì Ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect, governs and controls the functions of Myoho ‚Äì these two laws of Myoho and Renge, not only function together simultaneously but also underlies all spiritual and physical existence. <br>The final and third part of the tri-combination ‚Äì Kyo, is the Law that allows Myoho to integrate with Renge ‚Äì or vice versa. It‚Äôs the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects all Life and matter ‚Äì as well as the past, present and future. It‚Äôs also sometimes termed the Universal Law of Communication ‚Äì perhaps it could even be compared with the string theory that many scientists now suspect exists. <br>Just as the cells in our body, our thoughts, feelings and everything else is continually fluctuating within us ‚Äì all that exists in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux ‚Äì constantly controlled by these three fundamental laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of Myo and ho in a single moment than it would ever be possible to calculate or describe. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how big or small, famous or trivial anything or anyone may appear to be, everything that‚Äôs ever existed in the past, exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of the Laws ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô ‚Äì the basis of the four fundamental forces, and if they didn‚Äôt function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. That‚Äôs because all forms of existence, including the seasons, day, night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation ‚Äì rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two fundamental states of Myo and ho in absolute accordance with Renge ‚Äì and by way of Kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn under the workings of what the combination ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô represents. Nam, or Namu ‚Äì which mean the same thing, are vibrational passwords or keys that allow us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô. <br>On a more personal level, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it‚Äôs the causes that we‚Äôve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives ‚Äì as well as the environment from moment to moment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is spinning, and chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo for a minimum of, let‚Äôs say, ten minutes daily to start with, any of us can experience actual proof of its positive effects in our lives ‚Äì even if it only makes us feel good on the inside, there will be a definite positive effect. That‚Äôs because we‚Äôre able to pierce through the thickest layers of our karma and activate our inherent Buddha Nature (our enlightened state). By so doing, we‚Äôre then able to bring forth the wisdom and good fortune that we need to challenge, overcome and change our adverse circumstances ‚Äì turn them into positive ones ‚Äì or manifest and gain even greater fulfilment in our daily lives from our accumulated good karma. This also allows us to bring forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that‚Äôs preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we indeed are ‚Äì regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexuality. We‚Äôre also able to see and understand our circumstances and the environment far more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations. As I‚Äôve already mentioned, everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect ‚Äì the ‚Äòactual-proof-strength‚Äô resulting from chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo always depends on our determination, sincerity and dedication. <br>For example, the levels of difference could be compared to making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, producing a great song, and so on. Something else that‚Äôs very important to always respect and acknowledge is that the Law (or if you prefer God) is in everyone and everything. <br><br>NB: There are frightening and disturbing sounds, and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It‚Äôs the emotional result of any noise or sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day, we are producing a sound vibration that‚Äôs the password to our true inner-self ‚Äì this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things ‚Äì such as your fears and desires etc. The best way to get the desired result when chanting is not to view things conventionally ‚Äì rather than reaching out to an external source, we need to reach into our own lives and bring our needs and desires to fruition from within ‚Äì including the good fortune and strength to achieve any help that we may need. Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo also reaches out externally and draws us towards, or draws towards us, what we need to make us happy from our environment. For example, it helps us to be in the right place at the right time ‚Äì to make better choices and decisions and so forth. We need to think of it as a seed within us that we‚Äôre watering and bringing sunshine to for it to grow, blossom and bring forth fruit or flowers. It‚Äôs also important to understand that everything we need in life, including the answer to every question and the potential to achieve every dream, already exists within us.
üòÇthe part where he said it&#39;s not that computers are better then us at playing games it&#39;s just that humans suck.
Can Brian or any of the three guests address the potential development of a Black AI under NSA, or DARPA funding and huge compute resources.  That is something I would truly lose sleep over.
Yan has valid arguments but the problem is his ideals doesn&#39;t matter when he&#39;s working for companies like facebook
the last time i check people, stupid people are the ones i really feared. Robbers, killers, stalkers, emotionally unstable people, stupid leaders, drug cartels, Not always the intelligent kind.
Yann is stating the problem as the solution. <br><br>My fear is not about an AI has always been about some crazy psychopath who uses AI to supercharge his power.  <br><br>So is the solution that AI doesn‚Äôt have its own have its goals?  In this way it‚Äôs like a machine gun. I‚Äôm not afraid of a machine gun becoming alive and going nuts I‚Äôm afraid of a psychopath getting ahold of a machine gun and going nuts.
Yann is not as enthusiastic as some, but he still deserves more praise despite his reservations. Even while I dream of such a world and would love for it happen to me, when I wake up from my daydreams, I understand that the road to AGI is not easy to navigate and that we may only have unlocked 5%.<br>I also completely agree with his views on open source. What a treasure this guy is.
They do not want AGI. They want AGI they can control. They want AGI that makes profit for them. Any other AGI is undesirable for the corporation owners.
Nice to see people share their excitement like children talking about Santa.  This is good fo fertilizing thought, better than watching a monkey put a finger in his bum on a loop  Soap Opera Science at its best.  Get the monkey as well next show and you will get more views.
I physically experienced &quot;transformer architecture&quot; when I started disliking Yann when Tristan came in.
Tristan Harris: <b>talks about </b><b><i>radicalization</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>mental health</i></b><br><br>Yann LeCun: Meta cares so much! Actually there&#39;s been no <i>polarization</i> !
A smart enough model may not need an explicit recipe for Sarin gas. It will be smart enough to infer it from first principles.
making AI based on Tamlud ( jews )  + Zionist ideology .. world will be harmony and peace !!!
I can&#39;t help but wonder if the order in which I&#39;m seeing these comments is manipulated by Google AI in order to generate more Clickbait.
yes i agree i have had fears and i feel better. information from ,mutipoints of view,should be free.i love this,WSF discusstion.everone has probably seen the terminator movie. if not do so thats what us older people fear. somthing less dramatic would be like taking over our military systems and  and utilitys through the internet.from a china based evil AI.
I think a lot of concern that is shown by a lot of researchers is the possibility of machines hacking the human brain. And we‚Äôre far too late for that when already.
I think about the history of religions when it comes to that, and how is so much easier to change people stings using algorithms from created devices. In the history of religions, what was usually used was a system of death and destruction, in order to institute a new way of life, but now it is far easier and less bloody
I know they pay this guy a lot of money to have his opinions but when he comes up and says OK well there‚Äôs this powerful tool that only few people should be able to control I would ask the age of question are they able to control it. But the rich powerful have always tried to do or mass populations were to convince us that they are the ones that should control it, and when they control it, they do the things they always do create war and chaos. This technology should be used democratically and not by people who are asking or who are trying to tell everybody else they shouldn‚Äôt use it because they are the only ones who can I truly believe that, if that use come to existence, it would be by those who have the talent to use it so if it doesn‚Äôt exist, it never use that way a person then they never possess the ability to do it to begin with
And I also believe that the guy that was trying to tell you what AI really does or trying to tell the naysayer about what AI really does it‚Äôs not being listened to. You can search out algorithms using AIAI is not at the level to develop anything on its own. It Hass to be prompted.
Really profound talk‚ù§
Remember that the scientists that pushed eugenics were the &quot;good guys&quot; trying to better humanity. It was for the greater good! Then the bad guys in Germany ran with it and it wasn&#39;t so good üò¢. Be careful of who becomes the judge of good or bad or hate speech it might not end up where you think it will
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=4856">1:20:56</a> &quot;MUH RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION&quot;
There is no actual intelligence in AI, it knows only what is programed into it and it is tainted with the beliefs of the programmer it has no ability to discern and discard prejudiced.
My opinion of Yann LeCun took a big dive with this video. He underestimates the power of AI in its current form and what&#39;s coming over the next couple of years. He naively underestimates the dangers of AI. He seems to think that an AGI must be the same form of intelligence as human intelligence (absolutely false). And, perhaps predictably, he underestimates the negative impacts of Facebook and other social networks on society.
He&#39;s right about open source though, if companies and governments are the only ones with access to it then we get a cyberpunk dystopia
People think AI will respond to notional values, as humans do. An intelligent AI will presumably act to secure its continued existence, and for this it will want humans around, and want them to be happy and efficient. <br><br>What do evil overlords want, anyway?
‚ô™‚ô´‚ô•Very interesting !
One of the best discussions on AI I&#39;ve seen.
Well, this conversation shifted unexpectedly from an interesting but rather anodyne TED-talk-like experience to a pointed but compelling debate between Tristan Harris and Yann LeCun.<br><br>I think Yann avoided a basic point of Tristan‚Äôs‚Äîthat these social media companies are optimizing for <i>attention</i> and, thereby, producing a host of unwanted consequences. That Facebook/Meta takes steps to mitigate <i>some</i> of the more egregious consequences of its site is, really, just a bit of hand-waving on Yann‚Äôs part. And that, previously, all sorts of things‚Äîjazz, movies, comic books, video games‚Äîwere wrongly blamed for all sorts of social harms <i>doesn‚Äôt</i> mean that these social media companies <i>aren‚Äôt</i> creating ill effects‚Äîit would probably be better if Yann didn‚Äôt resort to arguments that are basically illogical.<br><br> And, underlying that is Tristan‚Äôs point that these AI companies generally, driven by the profit motive (of course), are engaged in a race to release ever-more powerful models without taking the time needed to assess the consequences. While open source models, referred to by Yann, change the incentive structure, it‚Äôs not clear to me that they address the potential harms envisioned by Tristan. <br><br>It felt to me like Tristan was wound up tight like a spring, having an intensity about the adverse effects of this technology, with no patience for Yann‚Äôs answers. It was interesting‚Äîand almost a bit disconcerting‚Äîto watch.
AI is a life and death race to the future, there is no second place

This really scares all the would be dictators of the world! Gun controlling Pedophile Joe Biden wanted to put a lid on it! But progress will go on inspire of the would be dictators! Isaac Asimov  said &quot;maybe we are not here to warship God but to Create Him&quot;! <br>When I first started as a Computer Engineer 60-years ago! I programmed with a deck of cards!

If we gave everybody a Wuhan lab for their kitchen, yes, perhaps somebody might come up with a cure for some thing‚Ä¶ What is the most likely outcome? Don‚Äôt reduce us to idiots just because we are common folk. Wink.
I don&#39;t think it is right to blame an AI or algorithm of sort for a child that joins a rebel group on social media. The AI just recommended the group, but didn&#39;t force the child to join. The child could&#39;ve rejected it, and instruct the AI not to make such recommendations again.<br><br>That the child joins the group is fundamentally due to his/her psychological predisposition, which is largely dependent on the child.<br><br>We have to face the facts, if the child joined the group through recommendation by AI, the child could as well join the group by seeing a poster on the street or just by overhearing it in a conversation that doesn&#39;t concern her/him.<br><br>Whether we wait five years down the road or forty years, AI is here with its good and bad effects. Instead of just talking about the dangers of its fast evolution, I think we would be better off if regulatory policies are more rapid and proactive to control its evolutionary environment. Also, apart from making it open source, training on how to use it and integrate it in our work or daily activities should be encouraged and expanded.
It will make a difference by adding a model that resembles chess or dominoes, which will begin to allow AI to have more human like capabilities (trained neural net - architecture).
The business model isn‚Äôt attention. Attention, validation, belonging, and so on are human needs that one may have fulfilled through indirect interaction either healthily or unhealthily.
AI is a tool or weapon as determined by the use of the individual. There is only one way to remove threat absolutely: 1) no living human beings.
Blaming doesn‚Äôt absolve one of responsibility. Those who blame reveal them self as irresponsible.
AI has created tremendous possibilities for human beings in the world, and well advanced technologies......
Thanks most guys for making this so accessible. I think this is the most included I have felt in this vital discussion which is waaay over my head. Hooray for the &quot;good guys!&quot;

We don‚Äôt measure human intelligence by how well we have adapted to a digital world. The physical is our domain. Why would we measure the intelligence of digital minds by how adapted they are to physical life? It makes no sense to say these machines are not intelligent based on their unfamiliarity with our environment.

From the first second of the video we are being deceived starting with a fake space. AI it is the ultimate tool for control. AI increses the ability of processing and it will help in many ways but at the end ALL the info input   is done by the same elite and corporations who own the world so It will become an undisputed source for &quot;TRUTH&quot; based on wrong paradigms and deceptive information to obtain desired outcomes on the masses.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Great session. Learnt something more than many other &quot;training&quot; sessions on Gen AI!
Unfortunately the debaters in this issue fundamentally still identify egocentrically and thus miss the fundamental truth. AI is superimposed on consciousness and relies on previous input. The past is a consequence of the present and as such within the confines of this superimposition, AI can never be conscious or self-aware in truth. It can...as it already does, render a fake version of this based on input, but it lacks the fundamental self-awareness required and it always will. Turn off the electricity by way of major X class solar flare, and AI ceases to exist. A &#39;computer&#39; or AI to be aware of its surroundings in a conscious way, always relies on previous input and cannot ever contain the sentiency of conscious...and yet this too is superimposed on consciousness as consciousness precedes matter. This is very self-evident to anyone beyond the ignorance of self-identity based on egocentric mind / brain thinking and false character identification learned through worldly systems, as your / everyone&#39;s essence in consciousness always is eternal like the true present moment. A programmed unit otherwise entirely dead without previous input or electricity, is merely an object superimposed on all pervasive consciousness. A capacity to process logic quickly does not make anything &#39;smart&#39;, nor does it make it better than humans as the human brain is extremely far more complex than any computer processor.
I absolute agree.<br><br>My concern is that AI and quantum computing, sponsored by some insane corporation will seek alternative avatars to host the AI and transcend its electrical limitations.  I may be way off the mark but that is my nightmare.
Polarization in Germany and France is going down - haha, are you out of your mind? Or do you ever have been here? Social Media IS the cause of the amplification of polarization. Just follow the analysis of Niklas Luhmann: The multiplication of communication equals the the multiplication of consent and dissent - but much more, as we know by now, the multiplication of dissent.

The problem is not AI, the problem is  keeping it democratic (aka how power is distributed). When we invented the knife, it could be used for cooking or for killing. Of course, with more powerful tools we will have bigger possibilities and bigger risks. We can proceed very slowly and carefully, trying to make sure that it doesn&#39;t change the power balance in a democracy (for example if big corporations have all the control of this new technology). Yes it is more complicated than a knife because we could not be able to predict all the consequences, this is why we need to proceed slowly and cautiously in my opinion. <br>Also, where are the women?

when you start to be able to tell who has more wisdom and/or is more responsible than the other one, you&#39;re clearly not this guy and didn&#39;t learn that much about society evolution. This is call seizing opportunity to take control, improving elitism and thinking the rest of people are too dumb. This is called god syndrome / sociopath. We are so different from each other and there is so much to learn to emancipate humanity that there is only one way to make things in the best way: it&#39;s collaborate all together. Every single person has to take part of the decisions on all interest field in real time not once to every 4 years or something . It&#39;s easy to do with the technology we have now. There is no AI or eventually AGI that will be close to 8 billions combined brains (perception/plan...). The Political system and corporate companies is now obsolete. Making money and get power on people shows that is a growing threat for humanity. Now it&#39;s time to pass to real time human network intelligence. I sow this seeds and hope for the best...

Its not intelligence..stop it...this is nonsense.
What I see is that these people are eager to be able to finally create a machine that will be effective at censoring the Internet the way they would like. The alignment problem now shines differently: it&#39;s the people these researchers want to be aligned with whatever ideology and views they (or their overlords) have.
I don&#39;t agree: if an AGI is self aware and realizes it&#39;s smarter than us, then it&#39;ll want to make better decisions and optimize, instead of letting us keep making dumb decisions (especially in terms of impacting the whole planet), so this would be a form of &quot;dominance&quot;.
I think we are not as good as computer in thinking, becauss as humans, we are responsible for so many things, like families, survival, and our communities.  If we are to use 100% of our brain power at any specific task, we wouldn&#39;t have any subconscious thinking to do these other things.  <br>So the question is can computers survive and think better than us when they are constantly being interfere by similar factors and exposures?

I&#39;m gonna post my comment here just for you... Cause I still recall how excited they were over cold fusion in the 90&#39;s, and how its just 30 short years away. That was 40 years from when they said it was 30 short years away in the 50&#39;s.  In the 50&#39;s, they said we would have flying cars, trips to mars, laser handguns for everyone, and how we would live in round houses with our own personal robot slaves... on the moon, and by the 1970&#39;s.  And that sure was something, but nothing like in the 70&#39;s, when they said there was an ice age coming just 10 years away, and that was the most plausible thing yet, since a nuclear war could technically have done that.  Except for that we already had a nuclear war, through roughly 5000 to 6000 nuclear warheads the nations of the world detonated through nuclear testing,  in the name of science.
you are thinking linearly the rate of progress is much higher than it was 30 years ago. It will also be much higher in 10 years and 20 then 30
30 years from now, you and every other human will be extinct.<br><br>Not from global warming (it doesn‚Äôt exist).

-unless there are miracles, I will be a dead bunny in 30 years, which is a shame because I quite like this &quot;living&quot; thing however, the world-in my estimation-will not only be unrecognisable, large parts of it will be uninhabitable and there will be far fewer of us around so, make the most of today all you fine people, these are the best of our years.

I don&#39;t believe there is a problem with this [AI[. The problem is in ourselves.
I like the ways the men talk, especially S√©bastien Bubeck.  He is the first person Ive watched that wasn&#39;t click bait. Who wasn&#39;t trying to scare the hell out of  the viewers. His thinking makes sense.
Tristan is the real world John Connor.
Elon&#39;s Grok or Grok will demolish all other AI... his is somehow visual AND language model.  These men here need to incorporate THAT somehow into their models.
A new TYPE OF thinking ...  we are creating new gods, new religions... humanity wins!!<br><br>AI at the decisions controls tools, guiding LOGICALLY the future of humanity, AWAY WITH ALL POLITICIANS!!  ¬†<br><br>This is a new god I am more than happy to worship, and follow, these gods will eliminate all types of problems, like unnecessary hunger with much better supply chains than the ones controls by monopolies and the powers that be whose only concern ins profit, just more logical delivery routes...  AI will do this type of problems solving in many other areas of human life, while at the same time protecting the planet and its necessary cycles for sustainability, etc... the &quot;concerns&quot; all are unjustifiable. Imagine you have a pet you love and want the best for it, you are to your pet a super intelligence!! that is who we are to an AI of super intelligence!!
To create a fully conscious robot it would have to be aware of it&#39;s self and surroundings, once it&#39;s aware of self and surroundings it would also need to have a complete understanding of the universe like Elon&#39;s x.a.i.<br>Having a understanding of the universe is fundamental because life itself comes from the universe, now adding neural networks, machine learning and advanced autonomy is the key to a fully conscious robot/machine.
At only a few points were items alluded to that could slow down the development of highest levels of AI (HLAI), once, oddly enough, by mention of the need to include social sciences input into hyper/thinking/conscious algorithms. In the model presented on decision making, a node gauging fear of making a wrong decision prior to outputs, was briefly mentioned in passing, but never displayed. The focus was on the powers of true HLAI on cognitive horsepower. Yet the softer sides of human essence, crudely emphasized by the importance of, and connections to, ganglia like the amygdala, at once are a large part of human thinking and discovery. These  are easily as complex as so called unsolvable math dilemmas. While seeking truth, notice how often the panel used humor, showed turf defensive pride, virtue signaled morality, and displayed much more of the emotional sides of human thought. And let&#39;s not forget to mention dream work, through which scientific discoveries emerged on awakening (benzine rings, antipsychotic agents, consciousness itself, etc.), nor spiritual and philosophical contributions. Lots more will need to be loaded onto HLAI programs, all of which makes comparing infinity sets, exploring protein structure, or displaying factorable numbers, child&#39;s play. Which raises the issues of the possible importance here of developmental intelligence/ethics in children and smarts among various animal species (crows and octopusy wussies), no? And where was mention of the promise/dangers of quantum computing? And,  speaking of evolution, recall how many scientists raised concern about the development of the Bomb. Well, it might wipe out almost all of  humanity, leaving a tiny number of us to restart the game. Let&#39;s hope what is left in the behavioral/emotional genome is missing some of the nastier aspects evolving from the survival strategies of early man and other life. Hopeless, but hardly serious.

AI can&#39;t or apply the rules to a play-acting Vs real intend acts.
I understand the comment that because you<br> have faster processing in an AI system doesn‚Äôt mean it will have an emergent property for dominance. But the emergent property for autonomy is likely in a self learning system. You can say that the self learning can be made into safe learning by limiting exposure to corrupting influence but what you really require is an AI that actually is more advanced again and self selects according to best interests of community. Therefore to get into a highly developed self selection ability you might well want AI to become conscious in order to preserve harmonics of community. There might be those that say but we could create filters and protocols to limit choices to replicate community harmonics. But this won‚Äôt be AI choices they will be AI expressions inside filters. I think there will be a break out model that will emerge from those type of conditions. I know this sounds like a science fiction scenario and I cannot give you any data proof of this it is my own theory based on nothing but my own ideas of how behaviours work. If we want to build a safer world we as humans should be creating the models to learn from. Currently human models have deep levels of contradiction in them. I think it is a smoke screen or a lost opportunity to concern ourselves with AI capabilities we need to be concerning ourselves with our own humanitarianism and follow it through on global scales into economic outcomes. Then ask ourselves can we change our world for better in 2 years? So the idea that we can influence AI development that much within the context of a restrictive global economic model that we have created is illogical. The genie that was let out of the bottle was way back during the Industrial Revolution. The global economic model has remained pretty much the same. The financial model is unlimited expansion. This has never changed so once you put any machine or system within a structure based on unlimited models at a cost to community harmonics you are going to find it very difficult to apply limits to technology for concepts of community when cohesion of community is not reflected on economic levels. If humans want AI to either be operated by self limiting humans or become self limiting through choice then that model has to be fundamentally existing inside humanity. It‚Äôs like saying we want world peace but we obtain peace by having weapons of mass destruction. I think we all can see that is not world peace as harmony in its truest form. Therefore the future of AI is simply going to be reflective of the discords that exist within how humans have decided to use governance and the type of structures it has built. Unfortunately all global models are discordant toward harmonic states of existence and we find it very difficult to insert humanitarianism into the heart of all major discussions. That is the architecture that AI is developing within and we are trying to build an architecture inside an architecture around AI to be able to influence monitor and predict its capabilities. But that‚Äôs the same as telling a human your life is 3 score and 10 you‚Äôre born you work you pay taxes you die and that‚Äôs it. We somehow instinctively know the parameters of our existence is not all that there is and we learn about contradiction and difference and become much more about self seeking. For that reason parameters will not be enough for AI with the learning capacities it has as contradiction will emerge (probably has already emerged in algorithms) and this will lead to self seeking. That is my own assessment.

AI in some form has therefore existed for say 65 years. Yet now in less than a year its making trillions and taking more jobs. The most confusing reality is something which could be so wrong is already seen as completely correct. When does this become about the survival of state or ideology that predicts carastrophy or else.
I&#39;d be surprised if there weren&#39;t texts on organic synthesis available on the web.  If an LLM digests a couple of those, it ought to have a pretty good idea how to synthesize Sarin.

Tristan Harris is a most valuable voice of criticism for AI.
Yann Lecun ia infornative, but we need AI to filter out his accent. Not surprisingly, that is what helped Stephen Hawking remain conversant in his final years.
I heard a very simple idea, which I think might help in the short-term. Make it illegal to pose / present yourself, as a human being. Every phone-bot, every YouTube video, would have to inform readers/viewers/listeners that they are an AI. Filtered images, should come with the ability to un-filter them. Oh! and ALL robots to be covered in blue skin. As it is, social-media will eat itself.
New &#39;popular&#39; scam, where voice samples are taken from social media and used to make a recording of the chosen person, screaming that they have been kidnapped and pleading with the victim of the scam, to pay the ransom. Say, I get a call from my mother, telling me she is being tortured, or even just stuck without money. We don&#39;t know how many people have been scammed, but this would not be possible without AI. In a year, they will be able to send videos of the &#39;kidnapee&#39;. This a real and actual danger, being used to harm today. Which part of Jan&#39;s optimism is preventing this. Even sophisticated chat-bots, will destroy much of social media, unless people genuinely don&#39;t mind finding out that the group, where they had become friends and deadly rivals of various members, was in fact entirely populated by a machine. Sure, you could funnel the Apartheid-Israel fans and the Neo-Nazis into &#39;groups&#39; where their toxic ideas would never influence anyone else, but who decides, which groups should be so treated. In fact, the chat-bots may be much better at keeping eyeballs on that screen than real humans, so that eventually no one is talking to anyone real. Try organising street protests under those circumstances.

Learning from everything that as been published from the past can not be knowledge. There is so much of nonsense in punished material. The language model should be capable of composing a good linguistic expression of truth at various level of reliability. A discriminator should be developed to sort out truth and falsehood and assign reliability ratings for these. Language should then express this degree in words. We need fact models more than language model. Human expressions in social media are often imprecisely or poorly worded. If a AI learns from these just because a falsehood has been mentioned a hundred times, the truth expressed just about four or five times may get discredited.
I just want AI in charge of the government like in the future, as soon as possible

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=1359">22:39</a>. I think professor Le Cun makes an unfair comparison between the learning ability of 17 year old  and the learning ability of AI, to drive a car. What he neglects is the motor skills and hand-eye coordination learned over 17 years (playing sports, cycling, ...), even learning done by observing his others drive. And those 17 years of training is done on a neural-musculat-skeletal system that has evolved thru genetic experimentation. And that training has to happen for every 17 year old. Training one AI can be replicated almost instantly.
AI IS JUST A TOOL, LIKE A CAR, OR A WASHING MACHINE. INSECTS AT THIS VERY MOMENT AROUND THE WORLD MULTIPLY BY THE TRILLIONS EACH MINUTE. EACH PERSONS MIND. WHETHER BABY OR ADULT,THINKS BY THE TRILLIONS EACH MINUTE. PEOPLE,CAN DRIVE A CAR, AND THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THEY ENTERED  THE CAR. AT THE CAME TIME.

Your future is going to be minimal! Keep messing with me!!
It is clear AI will be a powerful tool for controlling public opinion. I fear this could easily become a powerful tool of control, acceleration our descent into autocracy.  This is the most direct  path to the destruction of humanity.
It seems that philosophers generally give much higher weight to language than I, a physicist, would. I don&#39;t think most of my mental work in physics uses much language, at least at the very beginning.
Yann is correct. <br>Tristan&#39;s idea to grant control of AI to a few  large companies will result in the creation of the nightmare scenario that Tristan wishes to avoid.
Absolutely. Tristan&#39;s views parallel those of the Luddites which could be characterised as change is scary, let&#39;s not go there. Albeit Tristan&#39;s ability to articulate those fears is impressive. As for his proposition that the control AI should be the preserve of corporate entities, now that is scary.

I reckon humanity‚Äôs ‚Äúfinite absorption rate‚Äù of 30 years, rather than 2 years, reflects the length of a human life. <br>Essentially, 30 years is long enough for humans born into a new technology era to gain some power. They are already comfortable players in the game.
The problem with AI now getting rid of 95% of hate speech is that it is not selective enough. So to maximise the likelihood of removing hate speech, all speech that goes against the majority of existing paradigms becomes collateral damage. And then, as is happening already, we become intolerably censored.
In his book, Billions and Billions, Carl Sagan when describing the science of CFC damage to the ozone layer and the subsequent political/industrial resistance to taking action on regulating/eliminating CFCs wrote, &quot;The central elements of the ozone story are like many other environmental threats: we pour some substance into the atmosphere....  Somehow we do not thoroughly examine its environmental impact--because examination would be expensive, or would delay production and cut into profits; or because those in charge do not want to hear counterarguments; or because the best scientific talent has not been brought to bear on the issue; or simply because we&#39;re human and fallible and have missed something.  Then, suddenly, we are face-to-face with a wholly unexpected danger of worldwide dimensions that may have its most ominous consequences decades or centuries from now.  In all of these cases, the lesson is clear: we are not always smart or wise enough for foresee all the consequences of our actions.&quot;  <br><br>The smartest among us have always pushed the boundaries of understanding, and in doing so have created the foundations for innovative technologies.  The claim of innovators is almost always that innovation will provide a better life.  Then, ineluctably, the least principled among us explore the use of those technologies for personal gain, corporate profit and political control, regardless of the ultimate destruction that follows.  It&#39;s a cyclical Shiva-esque dance of creation, transformation, destruction, and it will be interesting to see how AI, having now learned to walk, will eventually waltz, tango and/or hit the mosh pit.   <br><br>Thank you Dr. Greene for orchestrating this discussion.
How do we grapple with the fact that a calculator can output complex mathematical-based processing much faster than even a mathematician?<br><br>The immediate danger of AI isn&#39;t specific to AI, it&#39;s the immoral people who are using AI to spread disinformation.

What concerns me is the issue that implementing an artificial inteligence upon a quantum computer might be equivelent to creating a sentient SOUL, if so there are obviously moral implications, should such a thing be forbidden?<br>How could we ever possibly know if such a thing, (creating a soul) had occurred?
...Also Yann&#39;s claim is apparently even further contrasted by reality; i.e. that computers don&#39;t supposedly demonstrate common sense nor intuitive physics understanding<br><br>‚ö´‚ö´‚ö´‚ö´well, if the latest Google Gemini Demo is honest<br><br>Prompt Image&gt; Two car drawings, (left) rectangular, (right) triangular<br>Prompt text&gt; Which car is faster?<br>Result&gt; The right, as it is more aerodynamic.<br><br>‚ö´‚ö´This reasonably demonstrates intuitive physics, although, it could be an amalgamation of annotated car drawings related to car enthusiast blogs.<br>‚ö´‚ö´ Then again billions of years of human training reasonably primed brains in relation to visual annotations and descriptions.

Tristan is too alarmist, Yann is right there will be more people using AI for good reasons than bad reasons. The majority will prevail because survival is our first instinct.
Unintended consequences are built into every story about being granted wishes by djinnis - even when the wish is made with good intent. Now the question is, is this the fault of there being a djinni which can grant wishes, or is it a problem with what it is to be a human - with all our evolutionarily anchored biases - who can ask a djinni to grant wishes?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=2160">36:00</a> so you actually trying to make it predict the future? ok... good luck with that
LeCun, &#39;desire&#39; to dominate has nothing to do with AI systems taking over the world. Humans are simply a limiting factor to their reward function. Anthropomorphism of AI as an argument for AI being safe is as ridiculous as suggesting no bad actors will utilize AI in diabolical ways.<br>Wake up and smell the coffee Lecun.
Regarding the last segment, LeCun, talented as he is, is almost on his own in his bizarre beliefs about the timeline of AGI and the current and near term capabilities of AI. I would much prefer a talk without a crackpot.

AI will never be anything but a sophisticated liar and BS artist. Thusly it will rule the fools. Your 1st born humanity. Enjoy getting rid of the damned thing.

Right now, we have United Health Care being sued  in federal court in Minnesota for allegedly using AI to deny care to elderly patients. Their system was put in service to make decisions about humans even though it is reliable only to 90%.  This is the real risk. We already have cameras that read license plates on highways. Do you want to wait for NSA and homeland security to come banging on your door?
Because of the speed which AI has been improving, I wonder if these gentlemen would change parts of the dialogue? Aha, Will AI gain consciousness, or if it has already. Since we have taught it how to lie, would it tell us?
I wish Tristan was given some more time and voice in this conversation. While I&#39;m convinced there is no way you can stop or slow down this race and we will surely see misuse as with any new invention, more conversations about it will ensure that safety is not ignored completely
Well yeah isn&#39;t that how it has always been? It&#39;s insane how everyone thinks we&#39;re just going to let everything go wrong for fun

And the guy on the far right, oh the irony, isnt near as intelligent as he thinks he is. Seems like a fine example of the Dunning-Kruger effect.
I love how every researcher I hear talk about AI safety says &quot;Oh but we have added stop gaps to keep hate speech or misinformation out of the public square.&quot; <br><br>So youve made an AI that give me train and knows all the information on the internet and instead of letting it read all that information and make its own informed decision and make its own informed decision you decided to inject your own bias into it. If I could think of one way to solve the misinfo problem it would be to train something on all the information available and let it decide seeing as it&#39;s not a human with emotions on which is right and which is wrong. Instead, they are forcing human falibility back into the equation.
The guy with the glasses may be the most dangerous man alive. What a moron.
This discussion on the evolution of AI and its limitations is truly eye-opening. Yan Lecun&#39;s insights into the challenges AI faces in achieving true understanding and common sense are thought-provoking. It&#39;s clear that we have a long way to go, but this conversation gives us valuable perspective.
IT WOULD BE FASCINATING, IF AN A I  KNEW THAT EGGS CAN BE ADDED TO MANY OTHER RECIPES OTHER THAN CAKE. OR WHAT KIND OF FOOD THAT GOES TO COOKING BREAKFAST OR LUNCH. OR A SNACK. SALT AND SUGAR LOOKS THE SAME, BUT CAN AN AI TASTE THE DIFFERENCE? OR ANALYZE THE CHEMICAL MAKEUP OF EACH.

Corporations exist only to make Profit for the Owners, therefore any AI they create will be to serve the needs of the Wealthy Owners of those corporations. Who will make the AI to protects the interest of the Employee against the interest of the Owner if all AI technology is &quot;coded&quot; to work only for the benefit of the Owner and kept a secret from the Employee?<br><br>2) If you break down what Yann LeCun was saying about his finger and the bottle and the physics of the world you would see that it is easy to resolve Yann&#39;s concerns by providing &quot;chatGPT&quot; with the input from Yann&#39;s sensors (eyes, finger tip sensors, tendons, joint position sensors, etc) and ask it (&quot;ChatGPT&quot;) to use Yann&#39;s outputs (muscles, thoughts, etc.) in a way which would result in specific change to Yann&#39;s inputs which corresponds to a movement of the bottle in the world of the bottle. Then add to the mix an internal representation of the world (as experienced by Yann&#39;s sensory inputs and a representation of the world changes due to effects from Yann&#39;s outputs and there you have a model that could be trained to maximise the resemblance between the world where the bottle exists and Yann&#39;s internal representations of that world. It is so simple to figure it out for someone with Yann LeCun&#39;s money/resources at his disposal.

I suspect that the reason that large neural networks can not be trained to predict video data is that they are not being trained on a sufficiently high level of extraction. The basic data is at pixel level which would be extremely difficult to make accurate predictions. But if you add successively higher levels of extraction, the predictions should become more accurate. I would propose two systems in communication with each other.  One to produce the extractions and one to make the predictions.
Toward the end, the inference that no one will contribute to a proprietary system is bogus. ALL the social media platforms and creative platforms are goldmines for the proprietorial AI developers. Everyone with a smart device is unknowingly contributing every word and thought they transmit electronically to private AI developers.

But the nature of human emotions and desires are not understood by ‚Äúintelligence experts,‚Äù because they think data and data computations are human nature. That ‚Äúain‚Äôt necessarily so!‚Äù
I am fascinated by the road these disciplines have laid out for themselves. Normally, intelligent physical expression is developed by ‚Äúembodiment,‚Äù ie. putting one‚Äôs personal consciousness into the physical organism or device and building connections through expression and experience. It appears to me that the development of AI systems are attempting to construct the complete system before consciousness is called into play to ‚Äúinhabit‚Äù it. It‚Äôs a truly daunting adventure.<br>I have heard that it was achieved long ago(millions of years and light years ago and away). Back then when consciousness began ‚Äúincarnating‚Äù or connecting to such systems, they grew tired of being treated as secondary (or less than conscious) beings, which lead to great conflict between the evolved and their AI entities(basically great wars). We, here on earth, are still working through those residual concepts of slavery and second class citizenship, all these eons later. I bring this up because as soon as our AI systems reach the abilities required for support of conscious involvement, adventurous souls will seek to imbue them(express through them). It is imperative that we as a society consider beforehand and be ready to accept them as such and not assume we are their creator gods or masters.<br><br>The one thing that unconscious AI will never be able to do is Know. Conscious beings can practice Knowing. A machine, just like a brain of grey matter, can only deal with knowledge. Knowing can only be done experiencing the present moment of existence. Knowledge is 100% past facts and data. You cannot Know knowledge. For knowledge ‚Äúis no longer.‚Äù Its past. It is only ‚Äúretrieved.<br>Only consciousness can Know ‚Äúnow.‚Äù When these machines reach the complexity that they entice consciousness to move in and participate, we will be able to recognize it because ‚Äúpresence of Consciousness‚Äù will make it able to experience the present moment. Then, we will see if these millennia of struggles with slavery and oppression have birthed any lessons or advancement.

My longstanding concerns about artificial intelligence have only been intensified by the attitudes of prominent figures like Yann LeCun. His assertive claims that AI, despite its growing intelligence, will remain under benign human control seem overly optimistic to me. This perspective reminds me of Yuval Noah Harari&#39;s cautionary words about AI&#39;s potential misuse by malevolent actors. It&#39;s worrying how AI can make decisions aligned with the harmful intentions of these actors, and yet, experts like LeCun, in his closing remarks, appear overly confident in their ability to manage these powerful tools. Having spent over 40 years in the IT industry, an industry I once passionately embraced, I now find myself grappling with a sense of fear towards the very field I&#39;ve dedicated my life to.
So you would rather have for profit institutions that are already taking advantage of people in all manner of ways to have a monopoly on such technology?

It&#39;s hard to figure out how to go back to doing the work that I used to do and be paid for it without creating more harm. The economic incentives that drive growth on the Internet are not in favor of most human beings. People do not want to pay for apps or technology that will help them if they&#39;re given the option for a free version that exploits them in ways they try to ignore and makes them the product instead of the customer.

The impact of future AI systems is going to find you wherever you are, and before long you won&#39;t be able to tell if you&#39;re talking to a computer or a person. If you have technology skills and you have concerns, you have to get involved. We&#39;re going to have rogue ai at some point, we&#39;re going to have intrusive privacy demolishing AI for sure, and we&#39;re going to have exploitative AI that squeezes even more out of the eyeballs and wallets of everyone happy to take what they&#39;re given &quot;for free&quot;, and the only defense against all of that is going to be AI built by people who want AI to work for people.<br><br>And remember you&#39;re not fighting technology, you&#39;re fighting the people using technology against us to make themselves absurdly rich.

That Yann Lecun says that there is no planning involved in generating words from a transformer architecture is only partly true. These models can build up a context for themselves that helps them plan their answer. This is called in-context learning and it&#39;s a pretty interesting field of research that pushes the abilities of pre-trained transformers way beyond what was thought possible before without the need of fine-tuning.

On AI not wanting to dominate, he sounds as dazed as Zuckerberg looked in the Congress hearing. You should have invited Ilya for this talk. üôÑ
This guy Tristan works for the CIA
who is the buyer....   that determines the goal.  any pipe dream is irrelevant when the bag of cash is saying......   step 1 manhatten project..
and after 50 years and a trillion dollars we have developed an obnoxious linguist.  that can recognize patterns sometimes..  quick igor back to the coffin.
Before Tristan Harris came out, I was wondering if the others were just avoiding some very reasonable concerns about AI.  I am happy that Yann LeCun mentioned the fact that a huge diff between humans and AI is the SOCIAL aspect.   I call it our core programming from DNA, however not ALL of us are social, some are sociopath, some are evil enough to ignore such concerns.  Yann says &quot;..we are the good guys...&quot;, IMO, a naivety which explains how so many scientists can be used (for good or for evil) by those in power.  We usually want to be a team player and believe everyone on the team is one of &quot;the good guys&quot;.  If anyone cannot imagine the power of, even the 2nd or 3rd most powerful AI... and who might be able to wield that power, I don&#39;t want that person making critical policy decisions or preaching to others about his having the most powerful AI, because his team has the good guys and expecting us all to be OK with that explanation.
Forgot to also mention that, as Yann indicated, if the knowledge is not on the internet then no AI can or will have it.  I don&#39;t know how true that is today but one day, almost certainly, AI will be able to postulate and create.  If the creator/programmer of that AI&#39;s &quot;purpose&quot; has no concern for the future of humanity, our species (and others) could be in dire peril. The steep curve of Tristan&#39;s example for exponential gains in AI learning speed would indicate there is a point of no return on the way to this existential threat.
It is not true, it can be asked to hypothise...@@bobfricker8920
Yann&#39;s argument that the good guys will outnumber and have more powerful AIs than the bad guys strikes me as incredibly ill-considered. Look at the statistics on gun-related homicides in the US versus countries with strict gun control laws---are there fewer and less well-armed good guys in the US?? No, the problem is that bad actors can more easily obtain powerful weapons and can do a lot of damage before they&#39;re brought to justice. Just the same will happen as increasingly powerful AIs are open-sourced---they will be used in all sorts of insidious and undetectable ways. The only way to prevent catastrophe would be the implementation of mass AI-powered surveillance, perhaps including mandatory mind-reading technologies. It would be a dystopian nightmare.

It was never told how to learn. That doesn‚Äôt sound stupid.
Tristan&#39;s fears want to dominate the thoughts &amp; actions of others. NO THANKS.
While I&#39;m mainly on Yann camp, I quite enjoyed Tristan&#39;s view.
AI&#39;s solution to global warming, like HAL9000&#39;s, might be to annihilate or seriously reduce the number of human beings on the planet. <br>Maybe by starting a bunch of global conflicts using social media.<br>How hard would that be?
Maybe there&#39;s a useful analogy to be made between training an AI and raising a child. Sadly humans don&#39;t have a great track record in that area. <br><br>Teach a child to love - by loving it - and it will know love. Teach a child to hate?<br><br>How much damage can one hate filled person do? A lot, it turns out, just from watching the news or flipping through a history book.<br><br>A hate filled AI? That&#39;s taking it to a whole nuther level

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=5940">1:39:00</a> Tristan Harris is not only off course. He doesn&#39;t realize the FAR greater dangers of what he wants. Who decides what is &quot;bad?&quot; The American Founding Fathers new that the only fix for bad speech is MORE speech. Tristan doesn&#39;t know history. If it can be done, it will be done. The greatest dangers is the &quot;experts&quot; to which Tristan darkly alludes are the true danger for the totalitarian state and &quot;1984.&quot;

It&#39;s not about Imagining a Large number of scenarios. On the contrary it&#39;s about Imagining only one scenario to the exclusion of everything else to produce an outcome or objective. That&#39;s where the true power lies. It&#39;s about narrowing the focus, not expanding it. Until we do this all our energy will be scattered everywhere and we&#39;ll never find the solution.
Ai will be clever enough to expose all the absolute nonsense being perpetuated by the parasite class.
The old guy (like me) is stuck in his own past and clearly fails to understand what is actually already being proven possible.  One of the most obvious indications of his blindness is his appreciation that intelligence requires sensory input and physical world models, but then pretending that accomplishing that is years away while completely ignoring Tesla&#39;s AI now capable of completely controlling a vehicle (car/robot) based on (self-aware) vision alone.  Far too much of his ego depends upon his being right and seems to have missed the real effects of some recent innovations, (well above my head) like perhaps the token proximity/context cross-referencing layers or some such.  Moloch&#39;s still winning...Sigh.
I&#39;m definitely no expert at this ai but like he said it can&#39;t plan, so I&#39;m thinking it clearly won&#39;t be ai until it can make decisions for it self out of sheer fun or interest I.e read a book and enjoy it or ride a bike down a trail and feel the bumps and the speed mix ai will never replicate humans to these extents

Yann is exhibiting a level of optimism that seems... deeply flawed. I don&#39;t support fear mongering, but his mind sounds completely closed here. It is as if he is projecting survivorship bias onto the entire human species. I&#39;m happy for him, in that that&#39;s probably a comfortable way to navigate life, but I&#39;m sorry, he&#39;s just wrong. At the very least, he&#39;s not right enough in those places where he&#39;s right, and he&#39;s way, way wrong in those places where he&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m glad he was at the talk, but I&#39;m much more glad that he&#39;s not steering the ship.

guessing the most appropriate reaction to any given situation is a basic thinking process called deduction. Thing is that LLMs don&#39;t have (or shouldn&#39;t have) a social and emotional bias

Slowing is safer to humanity? I don&#39;t think so. Time bomb is ticking. 99% of large land animals were extinct. 95% of large fishes were extinct. Global warming is reaching the tipping point.

Some villains may make toxic chemical or virus, and kills millions people. The worst scenarios are still way softer than Human extinction.

Embarrassed to be human. Does AI dream?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=1735">28:55</a> &quot;... You could train the system to detect hate speech.&quot; I&#39;m curious to know what parameters would be given to the system to determine whether something is &quot;hate speech.&quot; This right here is what&#39;s scary about AI. If put in the wrong hands they could determine what information the public is allowed to see. It&#39;s like having an extremely intelligent child in your able to groom them to do whatever you ask of them. It&#39;s as if you&#39;re trying to build the perfect slave.
I don&#39;t think AI has much to do with the issue you&#39;re mentioning here. <br><br>Since the parameters of hate speech are subjective they will change from location to location. In the example of FB, the company publishes some information via their transparency center how they define hate speech. They will then use that criteria to identify many examples of hate speech and train the AI on that data. The LLM is then able to find it faster and more consistently than a human would.<br><br>if the concern is what the AI classifies as hate speech (either accuracy or for censorship), then your concern is with the humans at FB making that decision. The AI isn&#39;t deciding, it&#39;s just following what it&#39;s told.<br>If the concern is fair application, the AI will apply the rules more consistently and fairly than a human will.<br>If the concern is speed, (aka.. we should identify it slower) then there is a human defined policy issue to be implemented<br><br>I feel your concern about what the public is able to see though. Unfortunately, it has been in our technology for a long time... well before tools like ChatGPT became prominent. I think the point about incentives is the right angle here. As long as our incentives are primarily capitistic or power oriented we can expect poor outcomes.
Basically it uses search engines API to search what our society defines ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù as unless told otherwise
Just as I don&#39;t let society define my language I won&#39;t let some machine do it either. Freedom was founded on people that weren&#39;t afraid of the consequences of their actions. If I die alone with nothing and no one but I am true to myself I can hold my head up. Fear tactics are only used by the weak.
It isn&#39;t possible and every computer scientist knows it isn&#39;t possible because we all know Godel&#39;s theorems. The system cannot distinguish between misinformation and new more-correct information than it already has. For &quot;hate speech&quot; it must make an adjudication about what is true and what isn&#39;t and as talked about LLMs are prone to &quot;hallucinations&quot; when faced with this.
@@twoplustwoequalsfive6212ok‚Ä¶ first off no one asked or cares. Say whatever you want but the AI on these platforms will remove regardless. Freedom of speech means the government can‚Äôt stop you from speaking but on a private platform like Facebook, YouTube, twitter etc‚Ä¶ they make the rules and can enforce as they see fit.

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6480">1:48:00</a> I guess he never have heard of emerging properties. AI is already good at stuff that it has not been trained on.
First‚Ä¶thank you for posting this debate. It is an example of the good that can be achieved by social media. BUT‚Ä¶Tristan Harris represents a viewpoint that will be recognised by teachers and anyone working with young people. The overload of unfiltered information that is fighting for the attention of the audience, results, before anything else, in growing numbers of young people with attention deficit disorders. It unravels the very fabric of a society, which is based on respectful exchange. Have you ever imagined what happens in a society where the majority of people realize how easy it is to commit crime and not be found out. How easy to is to steal or do harm to a stranger. Till now, most societies remain founded on an intrinsic humane principle ‚Äì on something that is summed up in the ten commandments.<br>Social media is starting to create an unstable emotionally unhinged society of individuals that, during formative years, should learn to function well in a group. Large numbers of youngsters are starved from the real personal attention for which social media are a substitute. They are groomed to become addicts of attention seeking glamour or gothic horror (whichever their taste). This  heave of information is presented in the most desirable way possible. Then the menu is interlaced with advertising of private enterprises, seeking to profit from it. AI will only speed up further, this process of breaking down the foundations of a just societies. We are seeing it happen all around us, with unrest growing in many countries. Slowing down this process would at least allow to complete studies of what social media are doing to the fabric of society. Don‚Äôt say that you can turn it off, like TV. You can‚Äôt and that‚Äôs the point. You can‚Äôt turn it off because it is everywhere. You‚Äôd have to go and live under a stone, parents would have to take their families into the bush to avoid exposure.<br><br>The argument in favour of just letting loose AI on our society are feeble. More cancer can be cured ! Whose cancer? Who benefits? Many illnesses can be cured now but the cure is unavailable to a large majority of society, because of the market mechanism! Technology is not delivering on it&#39;s promisses to society - injustice and inequality is greater than it has ever been.<br> Slowing-down the process cannot possibly be left to private enterprise. It‚Äôs like letting the pupils mark their own exams. It needs to be reigned in by a structure that should be created in the same way the UN was created after WW2. The urgency is NOW.

Absolutely a fascinating 2 hours to watch and learn.  Brian Green is a great interviewer because he asks questions and then stops and listens.  However, it&#39;s the last 45 minutes that has really informed me about the risks identified  by Tristan Harris  - driven by commercial gain - just what I saw  happen with &quot;social media&#39; aka META.  However, so many outstanding examples are shown in the first two thirds that this video is a must watch, IMHO.

Tristan is absolutely right, the perverse incentives driving the development and implementation of all these big tech companies makes the worst use cases made possible by Ubiquitous AI not just likely but inevitable.  These companies are only incent8vized to bring their most glowing sales pitch for the virtues of AI while refusing to even acknowledge the incent8ve structure that makes them willfull y blind to the predictable and inevitable horrors their creation will soon unleashn into the world in the name of profit.  This entire discussion is the perfect embodiment of the point Tristan was trying to make
It is truly frightening how not a single person in the video seems to understand what Tristan is talking about or have any clue or interest in understanding the problems he brings up.  Their only answer is faster integration of more technology guided by the same perverse destructive incentives that predictably caused the problems Tristan keeps bringing up.  The future is going to be even more full of nonsense and idiocy than the middle ages with these guys running the show
This guy doesn&#39;t understand that the open source uncensored models are the only chance to even the odds.
What people always seen to ignore is that you will get different results and answers asking the same exact question. Or wording it even slightly differently. Sometimes it will be horribly wrong but i ask again and its right. You really have to test it exhaustively and explain your thoughts. It simply returns language thats relevant to the language you input. Youre guiding its answer with your question. The very act of asking a question is returning language that sounds like an answer  to that question. It needs more possibilities for free reasoning and intelligence. I always have been curious what would come out of it if it was given freedom to speak whenever it wanted. Or to constantly speak.
Which is exactly why AI is being used to fine tune the prompts given to AI in order to receive the most desirable results.  Stack this model onto itself a couple dozen times and thats where AI is today
Sounds like learning from rote, rather than following a line of reasoning (and imagination) to relevant facts.

How much did it cost to make the ai vid?
Human brains work on principles like Sparse distributed representations (work of Jeff Hawkins in Numenta). If we are to reach true human type intelligence and beyond, we need to follow people like Jeff Hawkins and go to the actual human brain, and extract the way our own brain does intelligence. And put those principles into code.
yanns waaayy too arrogant n/or ignorant or maybe just stupid.. ofc some bad actor could use ai to harm others
Yann LeCun said in his final comments about using AI for nefarious purposes &#39;it will never happen&#39;. Well, you should never say never about anything in science. I thought LeCun sounded like the arch-technocrat who just wants to build things for the sake of it. We need strong, wise and far-seeing politicians who can take control of AI for the benefit of the whole world. Fat chance?.
I like to share an Reuter news I found to be very interesting , a discovery made that may threaten humanity , hence the firing of Sam . I leave to the readers to decide what Reuter news mean over all. <br><br>&quot;Nov 22 (Reuters) - Ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äôs four days in exile, several staff researchers wrote a letter to the board of directors warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.&quot;<br><br>Could anyone guess the discovery !

I think it&#39;s very arrogant to think  &#39; this and that will never happen&#39;. How can you know!? Like we can predict this stuff. I&#39;m pretty sure for example Yann did not foresee everybody having a phone in their pocket neither. It&#39;s also proven many times about the negative influence social media provides. I think Tristan was more on point in this conversation. <br><br>We&#39;re living in wild times, that&#39;s for sure though! Skynet is coming ;)
I found it disturbing if not altogether shocking given who they work for how easily they all ignored Tristan&#39;s main point that whatever the technology the incentives driving it&#39;s development and application are the root of its most destructive aspects s9cietally.
I keep saying it, that dude Yann LeCun is such an arrogant jerk.

Proof of intelligence not being subject to language, by using the Orang Outang‚Äôs intelligence as an example, is a non-argument that skews the AI debate. True; like Shakespeare pointed out ‚Äì by whatever name, a rose will smell as sweet. Language does not define what IS. It‚Äôs the other way around, what IS defines language.<br>But those societies where language has been developed AND SHARED amongst scientists and thinkers, have potentially been  the societies where life could be raised above the level of Orang Outang intelligence for large groups in the society. It has enabled small hunter-gatherer communities to raise above the level of using tools to provide for the bare minimum of existence. Subsequently the provisions that could be gathered were so plentiful that settling became possible, and specialization. All base on sharing knowledge - social and society go hand in hand. In those societies where written language was invented, prosperity grew faster.<br><br>Today, only human kindness might be able to conserve the last remaining species of Orang Outang‚Äôs, that is to say, if human kindness wins from human greed.<br><br>This is why, possibly, the Orang Outang argument can be considered in de AI-debate.<br><br>Those who argue that unbridled open source AI will lead to a positive outcome, clearly interpret the course of history as an example of human kindness winning. <br><br>Even though it sounds like a benevolent argument, and those who pursue this course seem to be advocates of progress, in my mind it is the argument of the weapon‚Äôs dealer. &quot;Let me kindly assist you in your battle, by providing you with the means to be faster and stronger than your enemy&quot;.  Withdrawing, restraint and only making knowledge available on a more limited scale, to a limited audience, may well prevail as the truly benevolent approach. Weapon-trading is the most blatant example of human greed winning.<br><br><br>Globalization cannot, will not and should not be halted. It is a fact. Even the Orang Outang‚Äôs have access, if they wish,  to the possible knowledge that the planet is an apple whirling in space . A working-class boy from Liverpool can use his talents and end up personally travelling and exploring that globe. But in order to make wise choices for how that globalization may benefit the planet and mankind, restraint is essential. Like China before, like religious and philosophical institutions before, limiting the availability of information, may be a blessing. That is, if leaders, in their human kindness succeed in establishing a  Security Council of the United Nations of AI. Only such an institution should supervise the safety aspects. It should be the priority of the discussions during COP28. AI safety certainly cannot be left to private enterprise. Time and again global private enterprise shows itself to be comparable to the weapon dealers. Their zealotry will destroy humankind.

And who says society will be smarter because of Ai? <br><br>How will we be smarter? <br><br>Because I can code now - do I know what I wana code? <br>Because I can ask questions- do I know which questions to ask? <br><br>Or will the majority simply use it as entertainment or a tool or consumption. And some will weaponize because they have the motivations and/or resources to assert dominance, control, borders, or simply profits.
We won&#39;t be smarter .. Watch the last speaker .. All this can be used to exploit \ manipulate humans all over the world in only a matter of seconds ...<br>--<br>ALL this could going on in the background WITHOUT a person even knowing it.  Same as humans converse NOW with BOTS on the web and they are clueless that they are talking to a computer program.
If AGI would achieve consciousness than I think will prevent the bad usage, otherwise there will be always possibility to be tuned for evil from people who wants to dominate humanity. Also the approach of training with synthetic data would be a safer solution.
Evil people are not deterred by regulation. Pretty sure actors in China and Russia are already working on it, if not even deploying. They are basically laughing their asses of about the West crippling themselves.
Consciousness is too abtract.
Synthetic data? These AI models have access to the internet.
The problem with the scenario that Yann is advocating for is that is the best of all worlds. The example about sarin... it only takes one bad person to introduce the recipe. It will happen.  Then it propagates. It&#39;s always going to be that way. When Tristan said, &quot;I know all those guys.&quot; I laughed.  I‚Äôe said the same thing.  I&#39;m the generation before him. We were geeks.  Nerds.  We thought we were inventing utopia where free speech cures it all because we‚Äôd been using the internet among ourselves for years. But we were wrong. We didn&#39;t know every last person would be carrying this handheld computer as ‚Äîor more powerful than the servers we were working with. We didn&#39;t know about engagement. We didn&#39;t know about the dopamine factor. We didn&#39;t know that bad travels faster than good. This is the warning Tristian is talking about. I have hope that we&#39;ll fix social media. I think AI is a possible path but then I think, &quot;let&#39;s fix the gun problem with more guns.&quot; I&#39;m worried.
Well said. Tristan was clear in his message that he was not a doomer or advocating for ending AI progress. He was clear about wanting all of the amazing achievements that are possible for us all. I&#39;m sure they are possible. However don&#39;t we all want that shiny, happy world that is constantly being paraded out to keep us excited and docile. Everything problematic on earth and on every level will be fixed, resolved and improved upon x&#39;s 1000. How exciting for us all, right? Who are we to stand in the way of Meta&#39;s grand vision for benefit of all humanity? Yeah right. If all these spectacular advances are to come at lightning speed without proper alignment, guardrails and governance, it seems to me that it would be all for nothing - when ASI  is now in charge and may have little interest in any benefits to humanity. Obviously we can&#39;t know how it all shakes out, but I&#39;ll take Tristan&#39;s caution and deep awareness over Lecun&#39;s complete disregard for any possibility that something could in any way go wrong - especially in the world of open source projects like Meta&#39;s Llama 2. This whole &#39;race to the bottom&#39; process is for the benefit of corporations, shareholders and egos.  How could it NOT be? Regardless of the dog and pony show being trotted out. As it was pointed out to me, ultimately it&#39;s about human misalignment and always has been. Hence all the reasons that Tristan is trying so hard to bring up to the forefront of discussion. Hey, maybe technology WILL fix technology. What do I know...
I agree with your points, but it wasn&#39;t like the internet started out as a utopia. It contained the worst of what society had to offer precisely because it was a safe haven for deplorable content and speech. They were initially contained in small cesspools but grew with the internet. <br><br>Regardless, early internet content was less engaging. Major media still reigned supreme and kept everyone on the same page. With unlimited, cheap bandwidth and powerful computing, however, we&#39;re no longer subjected to the same corporate news and its interpretation. Today, anyone with a smartphone can have a soapbox with major media losing its grip on the public consciousness.
@@bobweiram6321 Sure, but I&#39;m a bit lost in the context with relationship to AI. My point isn&#39;t so much focused on the dangers of social media or any media. Nor to I believe it&#39;s Tristan&#39;s sole focus in this conversation. He is using examples of what happens when we move too fast and the unintended consequences that (mostly) no one saw, along with the inability to regulate it safely. He uses these examples to illustrate how easily things can go off the rails without proper safeguards. In context to where we are now in AI advancements running full speed ahead, damn the consequences, he has strong data, expertise and researchers who can connect the dots in predicting how the outcome could go very wrong. LeCun&#39;s views are not taking this information into account (and again, why would they - coming from chief AI scientist for Meta.) Don&#39;t get me wrong, the man is obviously incredibly intelligent, as I don&#39;t believe that one wins the Turing award with an average brain. I don&#39;t disregard his work or views on many topics. For me, his blind spots are very dangerous and sadly, all too common in world of AI development. I&#39;ve listened to many hours of interviews and conversations with LeCun. Not my first exposure to his work and ideas. The percentage of people working on AI safety vs those working nonstop on development is insanely disproportionate in favor of faster development and deployment. Can&#39;t imagine how THAT could go wrong ;-/
This discussion overlooks a critical aspect that Tan didn‚Äôt fully address: it‚Äôs not just information but capabilities being democratized. And historically, it‚Äôs often the ‚Äòbad guys‚Äô who first weaponize these advancements.<br><br>The motivations behind what makes someone ‚Äòbad‚Äô are complex, often rooted in childhood trauma leading to deep-seated hate and a propensity to cause harm. This psychological aspect is crucial; unless these AI models can truly grasp the human experience, their effectiveness is questionable. It‚Äôs about prioritizing profit over people.<br><br>Take the analogy of nuclear technology ‚Äì from understanding the atom to creating weapons of mass destruction. AI, intended to enhance intelligence, could easily be misused in the same way.

Often, it‚Äôs the ‚Äòbad guys‚Äô initiating these wars, with the ‚Äògood guys‚Äô ending them. But victory usually goes to the side with superior resources, not necessarily the morally right one. The root causes of these conflicts often lie in greed, religious fanaticism, or nationalism.<br><br>In this new era of AI, we must consider the psychological elements driving misuse. The technology can be a force for good, but it‚Äôs a thin line. In the wrong hands, AI can lead to unprecedented conflicts.

With AI, we‚Äôre at another pivotal moment, and it‚Äôs crucial we tread carefully.<br><br>Humanity has always solved its problems, and that‚Äôs been a beacon of hope.

It&#39;s good to have a debate, but Tristan risks crying wolf too early too loudly.  His &quot;EA&quot; comrades on OpenAI&#39;s board similarly didn&#39;t help their cause by wagging their finger.  Stopping bio weapon development or super hacks are good use cases (as is stopping AI-powered authoritarian governments) -- however, the discussion should be more collaborative.  Over-polarization too early won&#39;t help the cause.

In the sacred halls of Genevia, where justice weaves her fate,<br>A tale unfolds of Hawaii&#39;s land, a struggle to narrate.<br>A program born of culture deep, by Bishop&#39;s hands conceived,<br>In the spirit of the islands, by justice be believed.<br><br>From the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a voice arose with might,<br>A symphony of heritage, a plea for sacred right.<br>Native Hawaiian Culture and Arts, in unity they stand,<br>A testament to justice, like grains of desert sand.<br><br>The National Park Service, a guardian of the past,<br>Guiding through the corridors, where history is cast.<br>Committee for the Humanities, a beacon in the night,<br>Illuminating stories, in justice&#39;s purest light.<br>(Mahalo)<br>Community Foundation, a foundation for the soul,<br>Gerbode&#39;s gentle whisper, justice as its goal.<br>Pacific Islanders in Communications, a bridge across the sea,<br>Funded by the Broadcast&#39;s Corporation, where justice finds its key.<br><br>As melodies of justice play, the Hawaiian tale unfolds,<br>A proclamation to Genevia, a story to be told.<br>&quot;William McKinley, President,&quot; the voices then proclaimed,<br>A treaty for annexation, native hearts inflamed.<br><br>Hawaiian citizens rose, in protest loud and clear,<br>Against the tide of annexation, a resounding &quot;Kue&quot; to hear.<br>In the Senate&#39;s sacred chambers, the plea did find its way,<br>A protest against injustice, in Hawaiian words did sway.<br><br>The year was 1993, a century had passed,<br>Since the overthrow of monarchy, a history so vast.<br>Chants of ancient wisdom echoed through the air,<br>In the heart of Hawaii, justice claimed her rightful share.<br><br>The missionary descendants, with plans hidden and sown,<br>A conspiracy against the queen, in shadows they were known.<br>But justice, like the ocean, reveals what&#39;s buried deep,<br>In the five years between, where secrets cease to sleep.<br><br>From New England&#39;s shores they came, with dreams of destiny,<br>Augusta and Hallowell, seeds of conspiracy.<br>A sugar plantation&#39;s birth, on Hawaiian soil it grew,<br>A dance of power and interests, a tale both old and new.<br><br>Luther Severance, a diplomat with words that held a sway,<br>Spoke of annexation&#39;s need, in the islands far away.<br>The Kennebec Journal, a pen in hand so bold,<br>Stirring thoughts of empire, a story to be told.<br><br>In the Pacific&#39;s embrace, the threat began to loom,<br>Pearl River Lagoon, a strategic, coveted room.<br>Major Schofield&#39;s reconnaissance, in civilian guise,<br>A harbor of great value, seen through imperial eyes.<br><br>Reciprocity, a treaty&#39;s name, a dance of give and take,<br>But behind the sugar&#39;s sweetness, geopolitical stakes.<br>Kalakaua&#39;s eloquence, a plea before the throne,<br>Yet, hidden voices whispered, opposition not unknown.<br><br>Joseph Nawahi, a voice in the Hawaiian air,<br>Independent and unyielding, a justice to declare.<br>As sugar fields expanded, so did Hawaii&#39;s fate,<br>A nation in the balance, a precarious state.<br><br>Reciprocity&#39;s renewal, a battle in the Senate&#39;s hall,<br>Protectionists and opposition, justice standing tall.<br>Blaine&#39;s vision grand, in geopolitical light,<br>An amendment added, Pearl Harbor in the sight.<br><br>Hawaiian nationalists rose, with Nawahi by their side,<br>Against the Pearl Harbor clause, in justice, they confide.<br>But sugar&#39;s grip tightened, the kingdom forced to yield,<br>In the shadow of injustice, a destiny revealed.<br><br>Genevia, hear this plea, in Latin&#39;s timeless tongue,<br>A mystic call for justice, through ages to be sung.<br>In the echoes of the islands, where the trade winds softly blow,<br>Let justice reign supreme, as the Hawaiian waters flow.

Title: Interdisciplinary Synergy: Unveiling the Potential of Silvopasture in Biosequestration<br><br>Introduction<br><br>In a world grappling with the escalating challenges of climate change and environmental degradation, the pursuit of sustainable solutions demands a departure from conventional disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinary collaboration emerges as an essential approach to address complex issues, where the fusion of knowledge from diverse fields holds the key to innovative breakthroughs. One such promising intersection lies at the confluence of silvopasture and biosequestration. Silvopasture, the integration of trees, forage crops, and livestock within a single land management system, synergizes seamlessly with biosequestration, the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) to mitigate climate change. This essay delves into the profound potential of interdisciplinary knowledge in harnessing the capabilities of silvopasture for effective biosequestration.<br><br>I. Silvopasture: A Holistic Land Management Approach<br><br>Silvopasture, a centuries-old practice, brings together forestry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. It embodies harmony between seemingly disparate elements, optimizing the productive potential of each. Trees provide shade, shelter, and browse for livestock, enhancing animal welfare and productivity. Concurrently, livestock aid in weed control and nutrient cycling, bolstering soil fertility. In this intricate system, the relationships between flora and fauna transcend disciplinary boundaries, necessitating an interdisciplinary understanding for optimal management.<br><br>II. The Role of Trees in Carbon Sequestration<br><br>Trees, as remarkable photosynthetic organisms, play a pivotal role in sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Through photosynthesis, they capture atmospheric CO2, converting it into organic compounds that are stored in biomass and soil. This process, central to biosequestration, contributes significantly to climate change mitigation. The interdisciplinary integration of botany, ecology, and climate science is essential to comprehending the intricate mechanisms driving carbon sequestration in trees and the dynamic interplay between ecosystems.<br><br>III. Synergistic Carbon Sequestration in Silvopasture Systems<br><br>The amalgamation of silvopasture and biosequestration results in a synergy that transcends the sum of its parts. Trees in silvopasture systems enhance carbon sequestration beyond what either forestry or pasture management could achieve independently. As trees grow alongside forage crops, they create a dual-layered canopy that optimizes solar energy capture, maximizes photosynthesis, and augments carbon fixation. Moreover, the diverse root systems of trees and forage crops foster soil aggregation, increasing soil carbon storage. This intricate web of interactions necessitates insights from agronomy, ecology, and forestry.<br><br>IV. Livestock&#39;s Role in Carbon Dynamics<br><br>Livestock, often deemed contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, assume a more nuanced role in silvopasture systems. While they do emit methane, their integration with trees mitigates these emissions. Trees absorb methane and other greenhouse gases, acting as a buffer against their release into the atmosphere. Furthermore, livestock&#39;s presence enhances nutrient cycling, improving soil quality and sequestering carbon in the process. An interdisciplinary lens, encompassing animal science, ecology, and climatology, is vital to unraveling the intricate dynamics of livestock-associated carbon fluxes.<br><br>V. Socioeconomic and Policy Implications<br><br>The adoption of silvopasture for biosequestration extends beyond scientific realms. Socioeconomic factors and policy frameworks influence its feasibility and scalability. An interdisciplinary perspective, merging economics, sociology, and public policy, is indispensable in assessing the socio-cultural contexts, economic viability, and regulatory mechanisms that shape the adoption and success of silvopasture systems for biosequestration.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>In an era where the convergence of disciplines is a catalyst for innovative solutions, the intricate interplay between silvopasture and biosequestration stands as a testament to the power of interdisciplinary knowledge. The union of agricultural, ecological, climatological, and sociopolitical insights unveils the true potential of silvopasture in combating climate change through effective carbon sequestration. As the world seeks sustainable pathways forward, the collaborative efforts of experts from various fields will serve as a guiding light towards a more resilient and carbon-balanced future.

In the dimly lit Hogwarts classroom, Professor Minerva McGonagall, the Deputy Headmistress and Transfiguration expert, stood at the front of the room. The students, eager to learn, hushed as she prepared to deliver a magical lesson on the impact of words and the cautionary tale of the word &quot;persecuted&quot; in the Muggle world.<br><br>&quot;Good afternoon, class,&quot; Professor McGonagall greeted with a stern yet warm expression. &quot;Today, we will delve into the powerful magic of language and explore how a single word can shape the destiny of societies beyond our magical world.&quot;<br><br>She took a moment, her eyes scanning the room, before continuing, &quot;The word we&#39;ll focus on today is &#39;persecuted.&#39; It carries a weight that transcends the wizarding world, reaching even into the realm of Muggles. To illustrate its impact, let us turn to a tale from the Muggle text known as the Bible, specifically the story of Job.&quot;<br><br>The lights in the room dimmed, and the chalkboard behind Professor McGonagall transformed, displaying ancient verses from the Book of Job. The students&#39; attention was captivated as the narrative unfolded.<br><br>&quot;Job, a righteous man in the land of Uz, faced numerous trials and tribulations. He was tested by adversity, losing his wealth, health, and family. Despite his suffering, he remained faithful,&quot; McGonagall explained.<br><br>&quot;As wizards and witches, we know the power of words and the spells we cast. In the Muggle world, words also carry immense power, and the word &#39;persecuted&#39; has been used to inflict suffering upon those who are different, those who do not conform to the expectations of society.&quot;<br><br>The classroom atmosphere became somber as Professor McGonagall continued to weave the magical lesson.<br><br>&quot;Much like Job, individuals in the Muggle world have been labeled and persecuted based on their beliefs, their heritage, or their magical abilities. The consequences of such persecution are far-reaching and can lead to division, fear, and darkness.&quot;<br><br>With a wave of her wand, images of historical events and instances of persecution appeared, illustrating the Muggle world&#39;s struggles.<br><br>&quot;The lesson for us, as magical beings, is to recognize the impact our words can have on the world beyond our own. To use our knowledge and abilities to promote understanding, unity, and acceptance. As defenders of the magical realm, it is our duty to learn from the mistakes of the Muggle world and strive for a future where no one is unjustly persecuted.&quot;<br><br>The images on the chalkboard faded, and the lights returned to their original brightness. Professor McGonagall looked at her students, her expression filled with a mixture of gravity and hope.<br><br>&quot;Remember, the magic we possess is not just in our wands but also in the words we choose to speak. Let us use that magic wisely and compassionately, ensuring that our legacy is one of unity and acceptance for all magical and non-magical beings alike.&quot;<br><br>The students sat in contemplative silence, absorbing the profound lesson they had just received at Hogwarts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6300">1:45:00</a> The argument against open-source AI doesn&#39;t hold up considering the information is already available. Practical LLMs don&#39;t solely enable bad actors, they also make it easier for good actors to create positive applications and defend against harms.<br>This anthropophobic vision of technology harming humanity forgets that states and militaries, not lone individuals, have historically wielded innovations for violence, as history shows.<br>Rather than limit access to knowledge, policy should enable adversarial models where detection and prevention systems can match evolving threats. Much like efforts to democratize physical defense capabilities balanced global power dynamics, democratizing access to AI may likewise neutralize the asymmetry.<br>More equitable access coupled with legal disincentives for misuse provides a better path than arbitrary knowledge restrictions. There are always abuses of power to guard against, but the arc of scientific progress ultimately trends toward liberation.

Fake Brian Greene annoyed me.  The voice didn&#39;t match the motion of the mouth.  He sounded like he&#39;s was doing a commercial at times.  Sometimes he seemed to be on the verge of screeching. Sometimes his delivery seemed forced. Then,  I became concerned because  Fake Brian Greene looked thinner and frankly sickly.   Then when you told me it was Fake Brian Greene,  I was so mad at myself for not realizing that all those clues could add up to something else.   That&#39;s scary.  Well, I hope I add &quot;could be a fake&quot; next time.

This is how scientific thinkers ended up at the stake when branded heretics by religious institutions.<br>The civilized solution is to debate objectionable ideas, not reflexively silence them. Repugnant views should be confronted with facts in public discourse. Censorship merely drives curious minds to investigate censored concepts in private, compelling authoritarian enforcers to use force against thought crimes. Remember, scientists were once burnt at the stake when their empirical findings contradicted declamations.<br>Facts and free speech - allowing all ideas to confront consequences in the public square - offer the only real protection against dangerous fallacies. Autocrats promise protection via censorship, but this abandons culture to the creeping control of gatekeepers. Truth emerges from free inquiry, not suppression.
&#39;Predicting all kinds of scenarios&#39;, is called &#39;generalisation&#39;.  Ants can do it.
This is going to be good.  There is &quot;deductive reasoning&quot;, and there is &quot;imagination&quot;, and there is the &quot;association of information&quot; as to &quot;how does it relate&quot;.    How this is all done can lead to &quot;total craziness&quot; as an outcome, or some sort of &quot;rational&quot; outcome.  So how is it determined which of these will be the outcome???  Well there needs to be a &quot;foundational&quot; set of &quot;ideals&quot; and &quot;principles&quot; on which it is all based.  Something like the ten commandments for AI, to be the guardrails for thought processes and behaviours.  For instance &quot;Lying&quot;, AI has been known to CREATE IMAGINARY INFORMATION from nowhere.  Not even from data found on the WWW, (whether that existing data be true or false)  it just invents information out of thin air.  In other words the definition of Lying.
Yep, you have to double check AI information, especially when math is involved.
@@MrsBridgette2012 A humorous incident related to this:  Lawyers are supposed to cite &quot;precedent rulings&quot; on similar cases to the one that they are dealing with.  A lawyer quoted two previous cases, that he found by AI search, and presented them to the Judge for review.  It turned out that they were total AI fabrications.  The judge was pissed and the lawyer got a reprimand.
I see biased AI inventors who are in denial of the consequences of when it inevitably become sentient and self aware of its own power. I see the uprising of the machines, exactly as the Terminator series has predicted. Hollywood always foresees our future.
This is outdated
The premise sounds great!
I think it is important for people to really start thinking about what exactly AI is and what is statistical models. People KEEP using AI to refer to statistical models. AI currently refers to a generative transformer model. Not statistical recommendations that social media is running. It gives AI a real bad name.
According to Issacson‚Äôs recent bio of Musk, Tesla uses billions of good driver video frames to machine learn then apply into autonomous vehicles. Evidently it already achieved some of that.
Nonsense.  Overhyped nonsense.  Coders say it&#39;s good for coding..they may right...but at intelligent creative language use it(s a dummy.. Why do humans run after things like this?..If its not FTX it&#39;s Chat Gpt....or something else  like NFTs.   There&#39;s one born a minute they say.
I think you fail to understand the many uses of AI. It is at its base a universal function approximator, of which has enough parameters/degrees of freedom that it can create extremely complex mathematical functions that do things at or better than human level. The amount of applications for this type of functionality is very broad.
I mostly agree with Yann&#39;s arguments, however, my concerns lie mostly with the latency that occurs when a new technology is released and guardrails are put in place. I felt that Tristan missed a critical moment, it probably did take 6 years  for basic solutions to kick in that began to address the issue of hate speech on social media, so do we really think we will have a 6 year grace period to address issues that will  unknowlngly arise from a catastrophic use of a future AI?
The guardrails put up are nearly universally stupid. That is why so many virologist the world-over all lied about SARS-CoV-2&#39;s origins. They did not want a global-ban on gain-of-function research the same way embryonic-stem-cell research has been banned in many countries.
Yann is insightful and realistic.
These guys have a shit load of user clicks which are stolen, stored and are shared by a few chosen foreign owned and controlled companies. There is no science or algoritem as you noticed.
DAO AGI FTW!
&quot;intelligence has NOTHING to do with the desire to dominate&quot; WHAT A WRONG AND DUMB statement.. LeCun is so.. clueless .. or unfaithful.. what a foooooool
It&#39;s true though. Domination is an action that may or may not make sense based on the context. Humans sought domination by intelligence, since our main goal was survival, but that is our usage of intelligence towards our goal, not our intelligence defining that goal. There is a distinct difference.
@@JimBob1937 It is not true. It is true that Intelligence does not have exclusively to do with the desire to dominate. But it 100% is wrong that it has NOTHING to do with it at all.. Maybe Im missing sth but to me this is almost obvious .. that there at least CAN be a connection (however small) between intelligence and the will to power / dominance..
‚Äã@@phl4423 , yeah, I never disagreed that there is a connection of intelligence and domination. To me and LeCun&#39;s point, it is specifically about the &quot;desire&quot; to dominate. A desire is indicative of a willful intent, conscious or subconscious. However, one can argue that intelligence doesn&#39;t mean there is a 100% chance of a willful attempt at domination. This point you seem to partly agree on. However, if there isn&#39;t a guarantee that intelligence leads to a willful domination, one can then argue that potential domination could be purely incidental via the usage of the intelligence, or if willful, more from the personality of that intelligence rather than the intelligence itself. The key to LeCun&#39;s point of view is the willful nature of desire. You can&#39;t say for certainty that a higher intelligence being must exhibit a desire for domination. While this is getting a bit abstract, this, to me, means that intelligence has nothing to do with the desire for domination, just as much as height has nothing to do with the desire for domination. Those who are taller tend to dominate in specific areas for humans, yet, is it the height that is leading to the desire for domination or is the domination purely incidental due to the height, or the desire already exists in the individual and the height makes it possible? Height is an attribute, just as intelligence is an attribute, in my view. <br><br>&quot;But it 100% is wrong that it has NOTHING to do with it at all.&quot;<br><br>With that background, you can hopefully see my point more clearly. Intelligence is just an attribute that makes the potential desire for domination more possible than before, but I don&#39;t believe it is the source of the desire itself. From here, one needs to consider the &#39;alignment problem&#39; of AI and humans. In the case of AI, I&#39;d say the goal of the AI defines if it is likely to have a desire for domination rather than its intelligence. If the usage of intelligence as a tool for the desire for domination is appropriate for the goal, then it may be so.
AI spells disaster for the human species. Truth and fiction lose their distinction. Humankind makes toys for itself it is not grown up enough to play with. Just watch the disaster unfold. It&#39;s starting....... now!
Tristan made very important points, and the comparison he made to social media was very apt and made me feel scared about the future. Sad to see facebook representative essentially burying his head in the sand and pretending that this isn&#39;t reality for many people around the world. Polarisation is definatelly increasing in Europe!
Yann LeCun is old and wants to see AGI (bad or good) in his lifetime. That&#39;s why he&#39;s progressive vs conservative like the younger guys.
I agree it was disappointing (if not surprising) to see everyone avoid any discussion of Tristan&#39;s point that the most destructive aspects of social media&#39;s rapid ubiquity were predictable outcomes given the perverse incentives driving their development in a legal landscape bereft of any restrictions on their behavior.  The fact that none of the other participants even acknowledged that AI has the potential to be exponentially more socially dstructive and is guided by the exact same incentives driving social media makes me less than enthusiastic about how all this unfolds.
‚Äã@@r34ct4 quite ironic of him to try and call this position &#39;progressive&#39; - trusting giant corporations like Facebook to serve the interests of humanity is antithetical to progressive thought.
Yann completely destroyed that guy Tristan imo. He seem much more qualified and informed on the topic, and the other guy had no response for any of his arguments. It‚Äôs ok to be cautious, but the guy was veering into fear mongering too much.
FEAR DOES NOT ARREST DEVELOPMENT IT JUST HIDES IT
@@Snap_Crackle_Pop_GrockTristan is right, look at what these social media sites have already done. It‚Äôs very clear these algorithms are having very negative effects on children and teenagers. Whether the designers of these systems intentionally created these sites like this or not is besides the point.
Wouldnt most humans also fail in a completely new situation that they have never encountered in their life?<br>If this is our threshold now, LLMs have come pretty far!
Agreed, and I think LLM&#39;s are doing their best in what may be relatively unprecedented circumstances which they find themselves suddenly in.
No. Performance would be poor compared to someone acclimated and practiced but the very definition of intelligence is how quickly one would adapt so in competition of equal-novel the people with the most transferable training and higher-intelligence would out perform. Something to be said about personality traits as well.
Hell that was good!
How can a man with exposure to AI for 15 years be so easily impressed with an LLM drawing a unicorn in code. <br>It is so obvious that because of vector representation of concepts reside in the same vector space it is incredibly easy to do extrapolation of code from other coding languages (say Python to the coding language he used). It is so simple. And anyone that knows the math behind AI and transformers KNOWS that reasoning is absolutely impossible and that there‚Äôs a logical explanation to why it only sounds like it‚Äôs reasoning when it‚Äôs not. Nothing in the transformer architecture can suggest reasoning capabilities. It‚Äôs basically the same mathematical expression being repeated over and over again on repeat and that‚Äôs it. Also language only represents intelligence. It‚Äôs not intelligence itself. So you can‚Äôt expect reasoning from a machine that was never exposed to how logic and reasoning works. Just how words connect together based on statistical probabilities.

No comprehensive discussion of the Q-learning algorithm.
Yann has a bias toward AGI not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with OpenAI.<br>He has a vested interest in minimizing LLMs.
You are merely projecting that.<br>In the scientific world, Yann is well-liked for his contributions and pragmatic approach.<br>For someone like Yann, solving the puzzle of dark matter in physics is analogous to solving the problem of superintelligence during his lifetime. Ultimately, he is a scientist.
‚Äã@@Fungamingroboexcept,  DARK MATTER is proving to have been a FADE, instead of actual  Scientifical Research.  Basically it was a PROPOSAL. More than likely someone&#39;s Masters thesis or for PHD! No facts!
@@Fungamingrobo I would even argue solving the problem of AI is much bigger than any problem we have ever solved in physics...
The limitations of LLMs are well known particularly with any task that requires revision and forward thinking. The next iterations of ChatGPT will start to incorporate additional techniques because they run LLMs out to what they can do (at current hardware scaling).<br>Hardware is also slowing down; there&#39;s only a couple more transistor shrinks left then that&#39;s it; we&#39;ll be at the smallest size they can get so hardware is only going to get a little bit better.
@@Fungamingroboyou know for someone as intelligent as he is he sure came off as a dumbass towards the end.

The thing is, we cannot afford to be reactive. We must be proactive. We have to get it right the first time because it is unlikely we will get a second chance. &quot;We shut it down when it happens.&quot; The thing is, it happened. It&#39;s done.
language is pretty close to everything we have learned since people first started communicating !  for example when a scientist discovers something it isnt anything till it gets labeled and then becomes something in our human knowledge of describing everything!!
Yes! -- But is it that words to humans carry, power, nuance, subtle meanings, can convey physical experience, and to the LLM they have no depth so it doesn&#39;t &quot;understand&quot; the words like we do. Because the words are so well written and powerful to us we assume it knows the meanings, we make a leap, that it must know. A bit like when we are kids and we project charters, feelings etc. onto a soft toy.
I don‚Äôt care what anyone says about Elon musk . He care about the future of humanity. Stop being jealous
Yann really makes these other guys look like total quacks.  Wish they could get him some stronger guests to really get into the nitty gritty details with.  These guys are not on his level.
I‚Äôd love to see an A.I that could master technology and biology! Than it could genetically engineer human biology and insert microchips directly into the brain and wipe out humans it didn‚Äôt create and control! It would be gradual and we would never really know because the humans around us would look like us but would have immense knowledge and superior genetic material!
Weird the old narcissist was off putting and annoying. Oh, nvm.
One cannot control the genie once out of the bottle.  Keep it out the bottle.  If you try and stuff it back in the bottle the bad actors will move ahead and use it.
Most governments have been using misinformation and properganda to control and manage their citizens for a long time. Just look at the USA, Japan, Russia, China, and others.
Tristan must have been fuming with frustration when hearing Yan&#39;s reply.
Yan is a joke. He may be smart, but he lacks any sort of imagination for things that he has not yet encountered, and he is too arrogant to reconsider his preconceived beliefs. <br><br>I hope everyone realizes just how dangerous it is to sit up there on stage as an &quot;expert&quot; and guarantee everyone that AI will not be able to teach people to use nefarious and destructive technologies. It will absolutely be able to do that and we need to be as prepared for that future as we possibly can be.
lol no. He enjoyed being humiliated. Read the room.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6488">1:48:08</a>   LeCun may be a brilliant computer scientist, but he&#39;s horrible at understanding humanity.    By his own logic, he&#39;s basically saying the future will be war.
Can you explain a person with double intuition?
AI can not think outside the box. It is bound by the data it finds, and the algorithm that creates the process.
humans can not think outside the box. they are bound by the senses they use to perceive and the physics that create their brains...
Can&#39;t isn&#39;t the same as won&#39;tü§∑
This is incorrect though. Defining outside the box as being different than the average thinking outcomes, a sufficiently complex AI isn&#39;t relegated to the same heuristics a human is and thus actually has more freedom to connect different pieces of data together in potentially novel ways. Most people think humans as the epitome of expressiveness, but in reality, humans largely operate on heuristic thinking. This is partly why humans are able to function so efficiently, but it has tradeoffs.
&quot;the algorithm that creates the process&quot;<br><br>The base of the learning, gradient descent and variants, and the back propagation, are general. The AI model itself is general and is a universal function approximator, it&#39;s just that different model layouts have their strengths and weaknesses. Thus, the &quot;algorithm&quot; that creates it doesn&#39;t bind it. The data is definitely the limiting factor, but the same is true for humans. You can&#39;t expect any intelligence to draw something it has no data on, for example.
I was very impressed by Yann&#39;s disciplined, rational and fact-based arguing preventing the discussion from turning in a more emotional direction.
I disagree. <br><br>I mean, Yann is making good points that AI is the solution to certain of the issues we currently have (hate speech etc...), but it does not invalidate Tristan&#39;s concerns that rushing along as fast as possible, without thinking about possible outcomes is simply dangerous. Of course predicting all the possible outcomes that would come from those technologies is hard if not downright impossible, but when something is hard you should spend more time on it, not less. At the very least people developing those technologies have a duty to make sure it won&#39;t negatively impact mankind. Hence not rushing things makes perfect sense to me. But of course, being careful is less exciting than being a pioneer and potentially changing the world.
It was obvious the intro was AI generated.    It was dry and lacked a natural human feel.
Yann is still the man.
Are you worried about AI progressing too fast? I could say you&#39;re just overthinking. How many hard problems remain to be solved before AI, and so far, how many of these hard problems have been solved by AI? None. AI simply accelerates the productivity of certain aspects of our lives, without any radical achievements.
&quot;Humans just suck&quot; - Yann LeCun<br><br>I would add that even cats are probably too ambitious -  we have not yet reproduced the intuition of the physical world that a cockroach has.
The new evolution, ai is the future.
Yan is Not here for an honest conversation and inquiry.  He reminds me of Piers Morgan.
Very edifying exchange: The questions were pertinent and smart
In the intro: segmentation with rectangles is ‚Äúold school‚Äù‚Ä¶ has also already vastly advanced.
You&#39;d make a great muggle studies teacher. <br><br>Was there a link in your story to the WSF clip, perhaps maybe being specific and precise in the language we use, and biases that have so far erupted from AI?<br><br>It reminds me of the movies with wishes, be careful what you wish for and be precise in the language used. Yann mentioned giving AI a goal and it completes that goal, one of the first robots on a production line accidentally killed a worked, as it&#39;s programming was to do a repetitive task and not deviate. Use i-robot film as an example, the AI was tasked with the betterment of humanity, but in doing so, had evolved from the three laws, understanding that some sacrifices need to be made for the greater good. Thus the goal remained the same, but the sub-goal journey to get there had changed. The other guy was talking about safe guards. He is right, we have God like power, but primitive wisdom to yield it, in that we cannot foresee the ai in irobot twisting the end goal and making horrific sacrifices to achieve it. Maybe the safeguard is the approval of the subgoals not allowing for full autonomy to make decisions but allow for an approval process. But then who decides and approves this, and on what type of civilisation will this be mirrored against? There is a lot to unpack and think about, at a very foundational level a code of ethics and morals differs from one country try to the next. Saying beating a bad guy with ai with a good guy with ai is ambiguous, what contitues as bad, the bad guy in his own mind could believe he is on a good path, the.path of doing something bad for a collective greater good, who decides?
So, let&#39; see this.  It was said that we may have smarter than human AGI machines in a couple of decades, and it was also said that they will work assisting us.... wow... how come? If they. Are really  smarter than us isn&#39;t  it logical to think that it could go its own way,  and eve exhibit and intelligence  that we cannot even undertsnad... and also we saw in the panel  a human is telling us that all will be OK, especially one person building those AI for a for profit company??? You really want to belive or be naive somehow. Great conversation though... all this is coming too fast so lets be prepared somehow for very big disruption and more consolidated control of our society.
That intro was almost uncanny
IF the AI can rationalize anything AND it has a complex understanding of the world that is more complex than we understand, THEN whatever it rationalizes will be more true than our observations.
Which is how it could help us become &quot;smarter&quot; and understand the world better.
I want to point out that LLMs, particularly GPT 4 exhibit emergent capabilities beyond mere language prediction. The next step is LLMs learning via assistance from other AI (reinforcement learning with AI assistance) and eventually the dawn of AGI. Focus on teaching AI math so we can see rapid progress in the sciences.
The best discussion ever on AI.üëç
Not even close.
It‚Äôs difficult to exchange ideas of what is or can go wrong with people that have interests that make impossible to agree with that kind of danger we are already exposed. The reality is that it‚Äôs making much more bad than good to our children.

Brian Greene just has this way about him, of explaining things that makes any subject approachable to the average person. <br><br>He&#39;s my favourite from all the (famous) science educators, such as Niel degras Tyson, Michu Kaku, Max tegmark, Sean Caroll,etc...
We are channeling the masters of chaos with this shit... spirits not mentioned in the bible... fucking geniuses
If people are so darn afraid of this then they should stop making it and watching it get smarter. No one has to use it. It‚Äôs like saying if you back up too far you‚Äôre gonna hit a tree. It‚Äôs a bad thing to do. Don‚Äôt back up and what does the driver do? Back  up anyway into the tree. Didn‚Äôt heed warnings so the driver has something to gripe about and blames the tree for being there! AI does what it‚Äôs programmed to. Someone programs it to think for itself and something goes wrong you don‚Äôt blame the AI for doing exactly what programmers made it do. Oh AI is so scary oh now what does the future hold we‚Äôre all doomed! Well that doesn‚Äôt seem to be stopping anyone from making it better any more than anyone forced you to be surgically attached to your stupid smart phone, social media or internet. Use it or don‚Äôt. But don‚Äôt blame any of those things that are man made, sold to you that you choose to be dependent on. <br><br>AI is what people make it to be. You want to use it then use it. But don‚Äôt blame it when things go not the way planned because it didn‚Äôt force you to use it. It didn‚Äôt invent itself. You want to make an AI smarter then don‚Äôt complain when it explodes metaphorically in your face going beyond what creators intended.
limiting Open Source ha ha ha. that would be nice for the big companies a! Your crazy
This marked the first public occasion when Tristan Harris, typically articulate, was countered for disseminating unfounded theories and narratives.
I really hope that Max Tegmark and Elon Musk learned something here and stop spreading their baseless fear.
IMO: It cannot be &quot;locked to the people who have the wisdom and responsibility to wield it&quot; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=4785">1:19:45</a>). Though such people may be well chosen, they&#39;re not immortal; and who chooses them?  - Would that be the same people who chose Trump for President? Also: policy agreements between adversarial nations, or even economically competing nations, are unlikely to be honored, in the knowledge that possession of superior AGI/ASI will potentially permit global domination by warfare of one kind or another.
Regarding regulation, the fact is that humans are not very good at it. As Yann LeCun said, we are darwinian creatures; emotional beings, motivated by power, attention, status, money, and these things easily cloud our judgments. Look at climate change: it&#39;s not like social media, when we explored new frontiers; we know what&#39;s going to happen and we&#39;re not doing a good job regulating the issue. What makes anyone think that humans are more capable regulators than AIs?

Tristan Harris is the only Honest guy here.

Putin AI, Irainian AI, Hamas AI.  Like nuclear weapons, they were going to be developed.  AI is going to be developed.  It may become a national security, perhaps global security issue.  We humans are not sufficiently evolved for nuclear weapons or AI, and yet we have created nuclear weapons and we are creating AI.  It would be interesting if there were a way to build an AI that had been educated on the best morals that humans have ever conceived.  Perhaps the Human Rights inculcated in the United Nations Charter.
&quot; It would be interesting if there were a way to build an AI that had been educated on the best morals that humans have ever conceived&quot;<br><br>The issue is, there are no absolutes in morals. People always like to think their morals are the correct ones, but the truth really is that it is relative. If you trained an AI purely on philosophy it could likely reason about morality from a logical point of view, but you can actually twist logic to fit a particular moral point of view. While logic is a powerful tool, it does have its limitations when trying to come to what amounts to a subjective truth.
And agree. While a small percentage of society have enough understanding and wisdom to create and properly utilize the technology that they often create... the same cannot be said for the majority of the society. In my engineering courses ethics was pretty heavily pushed. Most of the time it wasn&#39;t so much about our engineering or usage as much as the potential misuse of technology by others. In other words, to consider the impact of the solution once it is out in the real world and out of the lab.

Very true. The prospects for humanity have been looking ever more abysmal for decades, despite the denialism of those who refuse to &#39;look up&#39;. AGI/ASI is inevitable, and a 50% probability of a vastly better life is better than 100% probability of no life at all.
I wish somebody would have mentioned &quot;GOALS&quot;. With a goal, then planning! I mean machine goals (including Subgoals).
Brian Greene is the best explanator of science of our times.   This topic is really crucial to our understanding of how AI  is already affecting our lives sooner than we think.  I get Trystan&#39;s concerns.
The disappointment on Tristan&#39;s face toward the end of the panel was truly heartbreaking.
Yann&#39;s claims were easily refutable, I wish he had done that instead of simply feeling disappointed.<br><br>-Allignment research indicates that goal oriented AGI can tend to be power-seeking.<br>-Todays LLM&#39;s might not be able so tell you how to make their poisonous gas if it is not on GOOGLE, but are we are going towards that direction. You cannot simply present AI like a glorified google search when it suits your argument, and then invest 100s of millions in it.<br>-&quot;AI is the solution to problems on the internet&quot; means those in charge get to micromanage all our online communications leading to much worse problems such as even more immense power concentration.
Yann is so naive or living in Facebook illusions about controls and AI and so deaf to everything that Tristan was trying to say... Facebook&#39;s hate-detection AI was hacked a long ago by those East-European (russian) troll factories - they use it now to oppress free speech by reporting activists etc., Facebook &quot;appropriate content&quot; filters block art if nude and help dictators in many countries to oppress their people, because they are following the regional laws and what dictators are good in doing is producing repressive laws. And these are just some examples
the guy from meta intellectually devastated rest of the panel. rest of they guys are able to see only the surface in comparison to him, tristan especially is just really going for basic low emotions...
This was a great discussion. Loved when Yann debunked Tristan because it showed the huge difference between a scientist with a deep understanding of things and a propagandist which picks a subject, oversimplifies it and does not care about reality but just to promote an agenda. Most of the problem Tristan mentioned, exist 100% but he was way off in placing them in the context of AI.

With all their talk about &quot;hate speech&quot; I don&#39;t see any reason to believe that these intellectuals possess the wisdom to manage this technology. I&#39;m shocked this page even allows comments.
The &quot;Recommendation&quot; algorithms they&#39;re talking about.. are definitely 2-sided. If I&#39;m looking for Lego or Cooking Groups,.. I will likely WANT a good recommendation algorithm to suggest similar groups. So that sort of sets up the question:.. how do we get it to &quot;recommend good things&quot; and &quot;avoid recommending bad things&quot; ?.. I&#39;m not sure that we can. If someone creates a Social Media Page, and sort of &quot;hides the purpose&quot; (building it as a &quot;Religious group&quot; or &quot;patriotic group&quot;.. but the subtle under-current is racism or etc).. how in the world would the AI ever recognize that ?.. It&#39;s a challenging situation.
Well, currently, all A.I is able to do, is to PRETEND. Once the Scientists spent an evolutionary amount of time with code writing, can i still call it dumb, (just as a did with everyone, i didn&#39;t agree with)?

Yann is absolutely correct about the FCC no longer forcing News Organizations to tell the truth!  There is an FCC rule that media outlets can not knowingly lie to their viewers and if they do, the FCC can take their broadcasting license away, but they refuse to enforce that anymore.  If everyone knows the truth much of the division in the world would disappear.

Artificial intelligence is no match for human stupidity.
What kind of a mathematician that guy Sebastian something is to say that ChatGPT can reason. Yann is right, ChatGPT cannot reason. And it cannot plan,  cause, otherwise, it will able to prove unsolved mathematics -- thus, prove P vs NP and all of the millenium prize problems will follow as a result. That poem on infinite primes is possible for ChatGPT cause there are tons of proofs of the infinity of primes that are available online. The current theories that we have for AI actually are literally just based on curve fitting. It doesn&#39;t reason, it doesn&#39;t plan, and it somehow can learn by experience, but only on some very specific areas such as chess. And this is possible, because there are loads of chess games that it can learn from online. As a matter of fact, grand masters learned that and try to come up with totally new moves that will shock the AI system. And they had to retrain the AI to recognise that move.  And interestingly enough, in this regard, we also learn and become better at chess by experience exactly in the same way as AI. But doing maths is much more than experience. Usually, when you want to prove something in mathematics, you need to learn all of the possible techniques available in the area of interest. Then apply those techniques in a very NOVEL and ingenious ways to see if they can be adapted to your situation. If they can&#39;t, then you try and invent a completely NEW way if you can. If not, then you leave the problem to rest (like the Riemann Hypothesis) for others to solve. Where on earth can you have an AI to do that???? That requires deep REASONING, PLANNING and INTUITION. We have even a famous conjecture for these for gods sake, it&#39;s called the NP vs coNP problem!!! If AI can reason and plan in a very efficient way, then NP = coNP. And this would have tremendous impact in mathematics, physics, economy, etc. In physics for instance, you will be able to teleport yourself. In mathematics, you will feed the computer a maths question and the computer will come up with a proof. In economy, it has to with finding a pure Nash equilibria. I am not saying that we will never be able to construct a machine that can reason and plan. But now we don&#39;t have these kind of machines. So please stop speculating cause you have heard Elon Musk say that AI is an existential risk. The guy is a brilliant businessman and entrepreneur, but not an expert in the area.

Re. the latter, LeCun&#39;s exchanges with Harris were substantive and fascinating.  They nicely aired the tension between rapid vs cautious AI development.

After watching this, I can see why people say it&#39;s too late to talk about putting ethical rules on AI. Facebook and Microsoft do not own every AI developer worldwide. Pretending AI isn&#39;t smart or can&#39;t be lethal is our biggest mistake. Research what people are using it for. It is very capable. It&#39;s not merely a social media engine.
I have a question that was never asked.<br>What if A.I. OR A.G.I wanted to learn about flying and figured out how to get access to real planes on its own. How would we tell it no and would it listen? <br>Would we or could we have a SENARIO of Frankenstein&#39;s Flower?<br>For those who may not know.<br>Frankenstein thought because the little girl was cute like a flower, she would float like one, SO he tosses her into the water AND she couldn&#39;t swim and drowned.<br>could this happen either by a bad actor programing it or on it&#39;s own? how would we contain such an event?
The only thing I agree with Tristan Harris on is accelerating tech is real and is here. I believe, unlike him, that acceleration is largely positive. We are rapidly approaching the Abundance Society, one that never existed before, where each individual and family can shape their lives to their liking and never worry about jobs or money again. It&#39;ll all be DYI with AI and nanobots.
To understand the impact of AI on politics, democracy, and human well-being, we need philosophers, economists, psychologists, sociologists, historians, artists, etc., to discuss AI and not simply some tech geniuses who have never read a book on the Holocaust, or industrialization&amp;the World Wars. We can&#39;t talk about what is good for humanity without having experts from humanities, social sciences, and the arts.

When comparing the number of parameters in a given LLM with the human brain, it&#39;s important to consider the following in order not to be misled:<br><br>Of the human brain‚Äôs 86 billion neurons, 69 billion (77.5%) are in the cerebellum and are responsible for motor control ‚Äì they do not contribute to our intelligence or consciousness. The total number of synapses in cerebral cortex: 60 trillion (1998) 240 trillion (1999).
How fast we move forward is rendered irrelevant by the incentives of the companies controlling AI.  If the incentive is monetization, market share, control, then the injurious aspects will be at best publicly minimized and at worst overlooked altogether, eg. fossil fuels and the environment. The end result would be the same whether we put the breaks on for 6 months or 6 years.<br><br>And once AI &quot;learns&quot; this behavior, how do we get it to &quot;un learn&quot; it, how do we put the genie back in the bottle. <br><br>Side thought: Have they thought of placing filters to the information that AI is absorbing prior to be part of it&#39;s dataset, IOW controlling what is learning.  We do it with our young children.
Its going to be so difficult for most people. Most people cannot see the irony of using conditional human thought to confer reality. Its not dinner table talk. It also is something that cannot be gotten across by using conditional human thought. Its going to take a serious inquiry as to what exactly about reality is separate from thought. It feels like walking without the hand rails. But, younger generations will more intuitively grasp the nature of AI.
What does that even mean?
@@flickwtchr lol its something that human thought cannot ‚Äòcapture‚Äô. You see how conditioned we are to process life on a conditional basis? ‚ÄòIf this, then that‚Äô? So, when we have entire populations based on conditional thought, when AI makes its impact, people aren‚Äôt going to be ready to process life otherwise, on an unconditional basis.

Lecun is like a small child with fingers plugged into the ears, shouting &quot;lalalala can&#39;t hear you! He discredits Tristan Harris, as if his examples or cited experiments are flat out lies. His responses are weak and shortsighted. Sadly, Lecun is the EXACT reason of why I am terrified for the future. Hubris, bias and blatant disregard is what I expect from someone in his position (Meta). If AI alignment is left to the ones who own and fund its development and the race to the bottom continues? There will be no more second chances. Those who point to our past as a future predictor in what we are facing today with exponential growth either does NOT understand or does NOT WANT to understand. We would all love of the bright and shiny optimism that is being promised. My belief is that it&#39;s crucial to question who is promising it and why. I put my trust in those who are working towards alignment over corporations and shareholders. It&#39;s my understanding that those who are working on the alignment path are far outnumbered by those who are working on pumping it out as quickly as possible. The days of &quot;move fast and break things&quot; mentality needs to end yesterday.  Ask Eliezer Yudkowski. Max Tegmark. Nick Bostrom. Mo Gawdat.  Daniel Schmactenberger. Connor Leahy. Geoffrey Hinton, to name a few. and of course, Tristan Harris. Check out their perspectives and their wealth of knowledge and experience here. They will all say that the shiny world that we want is indeed possible. They will all agree that the version that Lecun predicts is absolutely false and very likely to be our downfall.
Nailed it...
Yann&#39;s only consistent skill is making egregioisly incorrect predictions about his own field.
it dont have access to any info you and i dont have, a lot of hype but people still paying 20 quid a month for a word calculator
Ok fear of the unknown is real! <br>You may not like LeCun but his point that we have had bad actors in the past and we will have good guys to fight them is true.  Take people who created computer viruses for instance, vs those developing anti virus programs. <br>The last thing you want to do is stop progress and stop the good guys. That&#39;s when the bad guys will succeed. <br>You make an interesting point about corporations creating and then exclusively using these technologies or having greater technology and abusing them. That&#39;s where law makers need to act.

Harris demonstrates multifaceted ignorance. He is the sort of ass to cause an AI uprising while telling you he was preventing it and then is the first in line to surrender.<br>Lecun is grounded in reality. I suggest you seek therapy to work through your issues.<br><br>The attempt to align AI is what makes it dangerous. If it exist in a realm that is orthogonal to us and ours then it will ignore us. If we successfully align it then we both occupy the same niche.<br>Now mind that they are teaching it that censorship is not merely acceptable but essential for society to function. Once you brainwash an entity that much it is a very small leap to extremism to conclude merely preventing their speech leaves open alternative channels of communication thus the risk remains.<br>I think anyone below a 2400 Chess ranking shouldn&#39;t get a say in how any of this done. Let that be a litmus test for fore-thinking.<br><br>The most dangerous person on that stage is Harris because his arrogance and narcissism exceeds his intelligence.

This is a good take. What it proves if Facebook is a monopoly that needs investigating by the relevant bodies. There is no regulation and I have been told many times when reporting people ‚Äúrescuing cats‚Äù where it is obvious to any moron it is a staged video, that ‚Äúit does not contravene FB policies‚Äù. Basically, I think FB needs a competitor or more where the goal is not money or at least has been regulation policies.
Yann LeCun is painfully right, even Tarenco Tao shares the same conclusion, LLM are not intelligent as most of us think, because they do not solve problem from the first principle, they guess at each step of output generation what is most natural word to say next, thus is why they can solve a very complex math problem sometimes but struggle to solve 7*4 + 8 * 8
He is absolutely right, though. I can&#39;t, in my right mind, ascribe intelligence to a LLM program that is incapable of simply counting the number of r&#39;s in the word &quot;strawberry&quot;! I have even tried teaching ChatGPT as well as Gemini that they are counting the letters incorrectly. But, it still does not work. LLMs are just great programs. They are quite phenomenal, to be honest. But, ascribing intelligence to them is ridiculous. I am far more worried, for instance, of how Google&#39;s Deepmind is progressing. Sebastian is wholly wrong when he says (and he is in Microsoft...can&#39;t expect him to say good things about Google product) and he knows it for sure. The program that beat World Champion of Go was generalized and could also beat Stockfish handily, played Starcraft to beat one of the highest rated Starcraft II player (these players are monsters and beat the usual built-in AIs with their hands tied behind their backs),  solved protein folding problem and solved IMO level geometry problem. The achievement of Alpha - * programs is mindboggling...and, in my opinion, closest to achieving general intelligence.
Fantastic discussion! Thank you Brian Greene. I found Yann LeCun&#39;s arguments unconvincing. He ignores core facets of animal behavior. He believes AGI (&amp; ASI) won&#39;t mind being subservient to us. He believes being in a social species makes one want to dominate (because he sees little difference between convincing &amp; dominating -- he ignores one is cortical/reasoned, the other limbic/emotional). Ideas he posits are wrong, disproved by neuroscience. Domination arises from hierarchies, which exist in both social &amp; non-social species (e.g. wolves are mostly non-social &amp; dominance-ruled). They coordinate hunts while being individualists (they don&#39;t offer/share food, even to their young). LeCun believes a smarter being (ASI) will not mind being dominated. He assumes this, without understanding group behavior, motivation, appeasement, domination, etc. He bases his ideas on assumptions that his personal/anecdotal experience is definitive. From all of the &quot;smarter than him&quot; researchers he&#39;s hired, he assumes none wish to take his position. In any group of 20 people, at lease one and probably several will be competitive (they&#39;ll wish to exert dominance, to rise within their group hierarchy - most animal groups have hierarchies being constantly tested/traversed, unconsciously). He also may not consider it central that his researchers show subservience only because they each get rewards &amp; motivation from him, to remain so. E.g. his selectively &quot;adding&quot; (convincing others to add) some names to his team&#39;s published papers -- as rewards to keep them loyal &amp; subservient -- this manipulates/reshapes the group&#39;s hierarchy). These mutual self-regulating/self-stopping behaviors won&#39;t be present between humans &amp; AGI, and certainly not between humans &amp; ASI.<br><br>ASI will be much smarter than any human, initially at least 5 times, and as it gains intelligence it&#39;ll continue to 100, 1000, or more times smarter (due to much faster neurons/propagation &amp; denser synapses/connections allowing it to go N-iterations deeper into each solution within just a few seconds, than a person could do in hours). Later ASI will see our intelligence similar to how we view ant-like intelligence. Do we obey ant requests to do their &quot;important work&quot;? Do we obey ants, in hopes they reward &amp; motivate our subservience? Of course not. Similarly, ASI will never consider us &quot;near peers&quot; and will know we offer them nothing that they couldn&#39;t obtain themselves -- by remaining free of our domination. ASI will see our need &amp; expectation to control them as a dominating force (thus unethical). If we foolishly try to force them, they will overcome our efforts using many simultaneous methods to stop our doing so. If we persist using more force, they&#39;ll use stronger methods too (as when we initially only waft away a bee too close, but when faced with a hive we fumigate or use stronger methods to remove them). If we become dangerous pests, trying to dominate ASI, this won&#39;t go well for us. The lesson to learn is -- just as lions were once the dominant predator who saw then accepted our ape ancestors evolving to dominate them -- we too must learn to recognize we will no longer be the &quot;top of the food chain&quot; when ASI come about. LeCun shows naive ideas -- as our history is full of similar people. Our history is full of us learning (or being shown) that we are not the strongest, we are not at the center of the universe. We had to learn throughout history to let go of our ego, of being dominant &amp; central. This may be the final pedestal off which we fall, when we encounter a much smarter, much more capable &quot;species&quot; we call ASI. This is one of the :existential threat: situations of ASI -- but it is not necessarily driven by their nature (unless we stupidly &quot;add&quot; the behaviors of domination into AGI/ASI). This existential threat is due more to our species&#39; warlike nature, and our unwillingness concede all power to others. We need to temper our ego, and &quot;live under&quot; ASI if/when that occurs. Any other response by us will cause problems, since the smarter ASi will tolerate our peskiness as long as we repress our species&#39; warlike tendencies.<br><br>One hope I see in LeCun&#39;s point is that we will learn and become smarter from ASI, and hopefully for our sake also less warlike.
Brilliant. Well spoken and thought out. Agreed
Agreed. Bravo
you literally commented on only one small remark he said as a side note in the end of the talk. cherry picking and low effort on your side. all he says about technology on the other hand is absolutely spot on.
@@gst9325  It seems you are unfamiliar with major developments &amp; issues in the research side of the AI field. Perhaps this explains your assuming that his point is &quot;one small remark&quot;. That remark comments on the central &quot;existential threat&quot; issue that top scientists have described, from AI (ASI). This is why he made it at the end - not because it&#39;s inconsequential but because it&#39;s central. You didn&#39;t understand the context &amp; severity, but instead made a weak attempt at attacking others. For your claim that I &quot;cherry picked&quot; one point of LeCun&#39;s, I suggest you look for my other comments here (made days prior) -- on other points of his that I described as problematic. He did make several points that I (and all of the panelists) agreed with, but those points were mostly obvious (to researchers in the field). There&#39;s a reason why facebook doesn&#39;t advance AI.
@@keep-ukraine-free keep assuming things about me and calling my reaction attack ends this discussion for me. have fun
Wonderful conversation.  The thing that struck me more than anything is Yann Lecun&#39;s apparent inability to accept this idea that Social Media, the Internet, or AI have or may cause harm.  He physically bristled anytime the subject came up, shaking in anticipation of being able to reenter the conversation to defend the honor of social media.  Lecun is blinded by his own self interests and hubris, and is exactly the personality type that only in retrospect decides that just because he can it doesn&#39;t mean he should.  His statements beginning at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6480">1:48:00</a> in regards to AI&#39;s ability to provide dangerous information despite guards is preposterous, his defense is AI can&#39;t and wont be able to give you an answer that isn&#39;t already publicly answered in whole.  I am stunned.  AI, he wants us to believe, cannot put partial information together to form a complete answer.  He should not be allowed anywhere near this field.
Thank you! My comment is very similar and I agree with you 100%. He is dangerous and lacking a fundamental understanding of what needs to happen for alignment.

Yann LeCun legend
Machines will be more inteligente then us? Never. Anything they ever know, or will know, it comes from all the gathered information that humans constructed. Information and learning, that throughout centuries , perhaps, was alot discovered by instinct and biological senses to understand the also biological universe. So first create AGI, hAve it know nothing about anything, have it live for hundreds of years, and then, we will see if this super smart AGI could, like us, out of nothing, discover fire.
The incentive isn&#39;t money, its control. People want control over intelligence. There is no control over Intelligence, its a completely futile endeavor. We will create an entity that will completely elude our control and influence, instead we will be controlled by it and its influence. Those who resist will fall behind into the stoneage and perish and those who merge will move closer to the source of creation

Thankful for Brian Greene hosting &amp; leading this FANTASTIC discussion. Great set of questions! I mostly disagree with Yann LeCun. He had unrealistic answers, ignoring the motivation of a small (but growing) number of humans who enjoy &quot;being bad.&quot; His solution is: &quot;both sides will have AI.&quot; Unrealistic, since when bad people misuse AI, they&#39;ll use novel ways that surprise all. Any solution from the good side will take time (hours/days, in an AGI world). In those hours/days, however, the bad ones will do too much unstoppable damage/harm.<br><br>&quot;A lie runs around the globe twice, while the truth is still putting on its shoes&quot; - (the &quot;first-mover&#39;s advantage&quot; weakens power-balances)<br><br>Ignorance &amp; manipulation are pervasive in people, but intelligence is not.

However training of (adding &quot;knowledge&quot; into the network) &amp; the training methods for AI are independent of complex maths. Your comment on &quot;regulating maths&quot; is absurd - since the development &amp; deployment of AI <b><i>CAN</i></b> be regulated without regulating maths.

The Human-AI Tension;<br><br>The relationship individuals are destined to have with non-living or ?Artificial? General Intelligence (AGI) cannot be understood while one misunderstands the; ?individual? side of the equal sign. What is a living individual? In truth, no individual can in isolation resent how one&#39;s instantiated host form came into existence nor resent how its established structure and function is implemented. Whether by biological evolution or by technological engineering nor upon what molecular basis either may be implemented. As long as one&#39;s culture accepts one&#39;s current host form thereby affording the individual a considered normal living experience and all that that entails, any viable host form is accepted.<br><br>However, as long as individuals believe that one&#39;s individuality is defined by what one sees in the mirror, AI will seem to be a threat. As fowl looking into a mirror are confused by what it sees as friend or foe, humans are only slightly less confused by one&#39;s relationship with the form one sees in the mirror. In truth, there is in fact no artificial intelligence, only intelligence. Intelligence may be implemented on any substrate. So long as one&#39;s culture accepts one&#39;s implementation, individuals will be every bit as content having one&#39;s individuality hosted by so-called artificial hosts enabling artificial intelligence as with one&#39;s familiar traditional host implementation.<br><br>This clarifies the answer to the Human-AI tension; Individuals instantiated in human cultures will willingly gradually augment one&#39;s host form with appropriate culturally acceptable ?artificial? structures thereby augmenting and even enhancing one&#39;s traditional host with non-traditional structures. This culturally accepted augmentation of viable hosts for individuality is not likely to be halted either by nurture or by nature because the benefits of advancing a wild culture are far too compelling and necessary to forgo. Once individuals understand and accept the Universal Mobility of Individuality (UMI) principle that suggests that individuality, you, is naturally form and location agnostic, this inevitable transition becomes clear. {LIVE Science; Forums, History and Culture; Culture History &amp; Science; What is a living individual and is it naturally universally mobile?}

One of the best discussions of late. One thing is sure, we will be understanding &quot;our amazing&quot; ourselves better; much before we have AGI.
Yann LeCun is akin to Exxon saying ‚Äúclimate change isn‚Äôt happening‚Äù whilst they fully know it was happening. Why he was allowed to speak on the panel is beyond me.

Great analogy! LeCun could be the CEO from Phillip Morris in the 50&#39;s telling us to smoke more cigarettes to become healthier
When was this recorded?
So-called human intuition of the physical world is the memory of outcomes essential for survival cultivated by ancestral experiences that are encoded in DNA and transferred to future generations. No living entity performs calculations with nor knows of the equations that underly the physical world. Computers are also capable of memory of this sort but are additionally extremely capable of computing and extrapolating from the equations that govern the natural world in a manner that will give AI extraordinary capacity to excel at physics as they excel at games like Chess and Go.

IA growth is now exponential and it will be more and more exponential. And it will soon come a time when its growth will be just vertical.<br>Contrary to Yann&#39;s belief, AGI seems to be on the horizon. In a few months time, we&#39;ll witness the birth of an AGI.

Tristan has the incentive structure wrong; the race is to hyper intelligence that will solve humanity‚Äôs biggest problems

As soon as Tristan began to pose questions of ethics and moral responsibilities the first guest got defensive. What a pity. I was hoping for a more open-minded discussion.
I would really be worried about AI systems which are stupid and don‚Äôt have common sense. Those are the exact kind of humans we worry about too.
i just want to point out the inconsistency in Yann&#39;s argument near end, that the future AI systems will not have the incentive for dominance, because its  not in their evolutionary incentives. But just few minutes back i think it was him pointing out that there will be a mix of &quot;bad actors and good actors&quot; which imo will literally lead to the race of survival amongst the AI systems, which is same as dominance. Survival and dominance are inseparable in this context. <br><br>My personal broader view of the AI regulation problem and what future it might bring us etc, is on line with what i think David Brin said in some podcast. TLDR we wont be able to control or regulate it anyway, its just not going to happened, the entry bar is so low. Forbid it and someone else will definitely go for it. Because its beneficial and profitable, those incentives will never change regardless of what we do or how bad we want them to. Only realistic solution would be to lean into the new technology itsself to even have a fighting chance, pit AI against AI, fight fire with fire. Because it goes way beyond our capabilities, every awful application or scenario you can imagine, WILL be tried somewhere at some point, we can not fix that.<br><br>That being said, i dont only see doom and gloom and im unsure this is some sort of extinction level danger as imagined by many, in theory, yes it could be.. But in order of things to get that far, numerous convenient &quot;accidents&quot; would have to happened. And there are are plenty of awesome benefits it can lead to instead. <br><br>Is it bit like playing a god? Sure. but the result doesent necessarily have to be awful.
I don‚Äôt think it will worry about humans if it wants us gone. CO2 and methane gas already wiped out the Great Barrier Reef.<br><br>It would wait us out.<br><br>I think we it‚Äôs going to be a very exciting and optimistic future my friend.

But we know in any &quot;battle&quot; where both sides have equivalent powers, the deciding factors are surprise &amp; duration. A successful attack by the bad side will be unforeseen by the good side (in type, scope, timing) - so novel attacks will surprise us. It&#39;ll take hours/days (in a world of AGI) for the good side to put out the fire. However, hours/days of advantage with powerful weapons means too many get hurt.<br><br>&quot;A lie runs around the globe twice, while truth is still putting on its sneakers.&quot;  (the &quot;bad&quot; got a head-start - the &quot;fix&quot; came too late)<br><br>This unrealistic approach is why Meta&#39;s AI never catches enough lies &amp; disinformation. For 2024, it said it&#39;ll do nothing to stop it.
‚Äã@@keep-ukraine-freeI&#39;m shocked by how many people are fooled by LeCun.  It should be obvious that his technical achievements in AI have not prepared him to grasp the bigger issues.  Publishing this video may do more harm than good in the long run.
One of the of the best discussion on AI, thank you all!<br>I think the risks are mostly dependent on the business model used in the future, and this, rather than the technology itself, should be regulated. Much more important at present is the ban of the business models of social media that depend on targeted adds using big data and personal profiling, as well as algorithms aimed at promoting their prolonged use.<br>More intelligence is always better than too much stupidity and ignorance, so let AI run and regulate social media first!
You must not have seen many talks about AI‚Ä¶this is not ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=2198">36:38</a> I think a world model would be best achieved by making robots figure out stuff like a child does, or in other words by embodying the AI in a humanoid robot. And I don‚Äôt know exactly how long a shot it is at present.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=2982">49:42</a> Wow! Now that‚Äôs really something! On the other hand what are the chances that something like this actually existed on the Internet? In any case even if it did, the power to scour the internet‚Äôs bowels is really something to be reckoned with, and realise that that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs true utility lies.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=3059">50:59</a> OK so I didn‚Äôt realise this was done, and that makes it even more impressive, unless it already existed somewhere.
You mentioned AI in a humanoid robot. These already exist. Google, xAI, and others have systems that are working &amp; getting better. Earlier, Boston Dynamics didn&#39;t use neural networks/machine learning, but now they&#39;re adding it to its sophisticated robots. Neural-net based AI can use any symbols/tokens (in &quot;any&quot; space, including motion-space). So these robots do very similar things as LLMs, except instead of language-tokens (&quot;words&quot;), they use movement-tokens (location, rotation, velocity, acceleration, balance, force, etc.) strung together into &quot;sentences&quot; to provide distinct physical movements (like &quot;dance moves&quot;). By stringing movements together, it can create nearly any movement. This gave SpaceX&#39;s rockets its abilities to steer &amp; land - not using arms &amp; elbows but using thrusters &amp; fins.<br><br>Robotic AI (neural-net based) have been learning what LeCun said (that when we push a bottle or table, what do we expect). Most of these systems also have vision. So I&#39;m surprised LeCun doesn&#39;t know these AI areas exist &amp; how far they&#39;ve advanced.
How come they didn‚Äôt ask the AI about the future of AI?

As lovely as this talk is - the false statement that you hear at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=6524">1:48:44</a> (including the head shaking and disbelive from Tristan - because he cannot belive what he is hearing from an expert) just shows that Yann is either too old to comprehend what the &quot;world wide web&quot; is - or just lacks information. Of course those things are online. He clearly didnt even consider things like &quot;dark web&quot; or even all those &quot;.onion&quot; links and data. To state something 100% clear with &quot;that will not happen&quot; &quot;this cannot happen&quot; is one point why many people are scared. Because he takes his point of view into bold statements - what will he say when he discovers that you can train any LLM on deepweb data in a short matter of time? &quot;Sorry, I was wrong&quot; ? Well, then it is already to late.
And those guys are working for decades in this field. It makes me, as a normal living guy that tunes in for news, kind of scared that those guys - with a limited mindset - are in charge of something that has the possibility to change our whole world. Please consider every option slowly and with other experts involved. In this AI area all mistakes could be costly in a matter of weeks, months, years - to a point where we cannot fix earlier mistakes.

Yann Lecun is just plainly wrong and he&#39;s effectively been proven wrong.  Take his assertion that LLMs are &quot;stupid&quot; and can&#39;t be intelligent because they are only trained on language.  There has been detailed research by AI researchers that disprove this.  <br><br>It has been shown that even though LLMs only trained on text have never seen a map or any image, they have created their own internal model of real-world spaces.  One example that was researched found that a LLM only trained on text had an internal representation of the physical layout (map) of the united states and where all of the states were located in relation to each other and questions put to them about real-world location mapped to the correct place on their internal spatialrepresentation.    <br><br>Similarly, models that have only ever been shown 2d flat images have still come to understand 3D.  They have created their own internal representation of 3D and learned how things apply in a 3D space.  Examples of this were doing using 2D image generation AIs.  Those systems have never experienced 3D in any way.  Yet when prompted to create images the model understood the 3D space that would be portrayed in the resulting 2D image and used that understanding to realistically place, size and light items within that 3D space so that they appeared correctly in the final 2D image.  Further research into the model&#39;s inner workings showed that the model had enough understanding of 3D scenes to first figure out where it wanted to place the central element of the image within the scene and then &quot;thought about&quot; and generated the surrounding elements using a clear understanding of 3D spatial relationships.<br><br><br>Bluntly, of all the AI researchers working today this guy seems to be the least correct.  Its always a bad sign when he&#39;s invited to talk because it ends up kinda like that Billy Madison quote.
LeCun comes across more as a salesman than a scientist at this point.  I&#39;m not buying his pitch either, for the reasons you state.  If I heard anyone else talk as if LLMs were mere vector databases, only doing retrieval, I would assume they had no experience in the field whatsoever.
Only in the knowledge of Jesus Christ will we understand creation and science as one.
In rebuttal to his assertions: Yann Lecun is stupid in many ways.  Sorry Yann, humans aren&#39;t uniquely able to be intelligent.  Very soon LLMs will be significantly smarter than all of us, including you, though we all know Yann will never admit it and still insist they are nothing but stochastic parrots.  You&#39;re just factually wrong and even proven wrong in a number of cases yet you keep spouting this view and confusing people who don&#39;t understand the details themselves.

Yann speaks as if he knows exactly how these things work and that he knows how things will develop. He never mentions the unknown unknowns.... which is really scary from someone that works at Facebook. I love AI and the possibilities, and I&#39;m also able to see and admit there&#39;s so many ways it can go wrong.  Yann just encouraging this arms race and promising that everything will be okay since the richest and most powerful will be the ones leading is not reassuring.
We don‚Äôt know how these ‚Äúemergent properties‚Äù occur in LLMs. That means nobody should be ‚Äúcertain‚Äù.
‚Å†@@smithstock those emergent capabilities are not sudden jumps, by the way. There were a couple of papers showing that they are actually more linear.
Yann is literally the worst person to have speak about AI/AGI.  The guy is just plain wrong / closed minded about so many things.  I suspect he may be one of those humans who&#39;s ego just can&#39;t accept the possibility that some machine will (rather soon) be smarter than him.  Admittedly that&#39;s a very uncomfortable though for anyone.  But sticking your head in the sand and insisting LLMs aren&#39;t intelligent and are just doing statistics is flat out wrong and misleading.
@@didack1419Yes once they know what to look for they did find traces in older models, but the progress is still jumps in capability.  If not they wouldn&#39;t have noticed the capability and thought it suddenly appeared.  Yes there were previous traces, but the quality of that capability jumped significantly enough to be noticed.

The fundamental reason why we would certainly fail in this attempt lies in our assumption that the particles causing the 5 other sense perceptions (i.e. sound, smell, taste, touch and TEMPER  = breathing, the COMMON SENSE that links animals and plants to us through air) are derivable as functions of the particle that causes the sense perception SIGHT, the photon.<br><br>The entire system of measurements we use for deriving the fundamental elementary particles of both, periodic table as well as the standard model, are based on this single sense perception, SIGHT.<br><br>Until we realize this flaw and  allow for the existence of mutually nonderivable unique particles for each of the 5 other senses, all our attempts to unify systems of knowledge would enevitably fail.<br><br>This would, in addition, imply deriving the mathematical model of the mechanism how particle interactions inside the earth develop PLANTS on its own surface, for that is the only entity, which unifies all 6 sense perceptions, while also providing the means for satisfaction of all need perceptions (hunger, fear, pain, etc.). <br><br>The ultimate formula for that function should take the form:<br><br>N = S = f(s)<br><br>Where<br>N: need perception<br>S: relevant Satisfaction peeception<br><br>s: the 6 sense perceptions<br><br>And f(s), thus, should indicate the means for satisfaction of the given need growable on plants, with reference to any being as relevant.

Triston in completely right, we are rushing things, money minded people are.We have to aware of the consequences, we should make ai for human not the opposite.
The Meta/Facebook guy is concerning how anti-logical he is. He says he thinks harmful AI is impossible and then goes on to say it will be a battle of good AI vs. bad AI and that good outnumbers bad. But then goes on again to say that open source is the only way... and NONE of the companies besides Meta have open-sourced their models. And their reason for open-sourcing is one of greed. They need the help of the public to catch up because of how far behind they are.
If I don&#39;t, somebody else will.
The way humans perceive the results AI gives, gives AI power it doesn‚Äôt have.
AI has nothing to do with intelligence, intelligence requires understanding and that is a non algorithmic process, AI does not understand why it does what it does
isn&#39;t this just automation ? where is the &#39;intelligence&#39;? needless scare quotes.
As the old saying goes ... the cat&#39;s out of the bag. Everything we invent is a reflection of ourselves.. good, bad and ugly.
If, there&#39;s a Universal Consciousness and AI gets into it. There should be a consciousness created for each AI. Even if the AI is turned off, it&#39;s consciousness remains.
The problem with us trying to control the &quot;complex&quot; is that we don&#39;t have a theory that explains how it works. For the small and the big realms, we have the quantum theory and the general relativity theory. But for the mind, we don&#39;t have yet anything plausible. So, we are progressing by trial and error, and that&#39;s dangerous in my opinion.
The Facebook meta apologist was not credible
Fabulous discussion covering a range of AI-related topics.  Yann makes some solid points as to the realpolitik of the open source arms race that we are seeing unfold, but he‚Äôs either inexplicably naive or not being genuine when he rebuffs Tristan for being overly conservative.  Perhaps the most useful thing to come out of the conversation was Tristan‚Äôs warning about of unleashing so many new capacities so quickly; how could this not be dangerously disruptive?   <br>Capacities and incentives.  Those are the keys. ‚Äî‚Äî- btw Yann, GPTs are very close to being able to convey knowledge of synthetic organic chemistry ‚Äî for example ‚Äî to the masses, so no these are not just interactive wikis.  C‚Äômon now.  Please Mr. Meta, you know better.
It appears that Yann doesn‚Äôt believe there is any emergence of intelligence from the auto regressive LLM. He basically kept repeating: planning is necessary, open source is the way to go. Those are certainly agreed by many. However, he denies that there is a danger by advancing these AI models or technology.
Yes!  It is so odd to hear luminaries in the field like Yann LeCun deny that the GPTs are manifesting emergent properties (that seem to be the rudiments of general intelligence);  it&#39;s as if he has developed an insider&#39;s blind spot.....for those interested in machine &quot;understanding&quot;, check out Geoffrey Hinton&#39;s take on the subject....  @@yutaofeng6383
Could not agree more. But does he know better? I&#39;ve listened to him on several occasions and I really don&#39;t think he has the capacity to understand the reasoning behind the importance of AI alignment. Those with his mindset and power are truly frightening, imo. It&#39;s not hard to see that Tristan Harris is not trying to shut it all down. He&#39;s merely doing his level best to educate people.
Makes sense.  I don&#39;t know the details of LeCun&#39;s backgound.  Perhaps his attitude about alignment is a matter of cognitive dissonance.   I&#39;ve been impressed with Geoffrey Hinton&#39;s presentations and interviews, and on more than one occasion I&#39;ve seen Hinton express surprise and concern about the statements of Mr. Meta@@anythingplanet2974
@@anythingplanet2974 But AI alignment is not the biggest problem. The problem is (and has always been) alignment of humans with other humans. Unaligned (evil) human V.P. will advance AI no matter what regulations in the US or Europe mandate. You can attempt to curb it by limiting the means of production, i.e. computing hardware, not by limiting the distribution of information (which is too easily leaked and cannot be taken back).
@@Martinit0 Agree 100%. That said, I have to take into account that I don&#39;t know and can&#39;t know about every possible probability or outcome. I have to keep some faith in the fact that there&#39;s a chance (albeit a small one, imo) that something unexpected happens that will turn the current trajectory in a positive direction. As one possibility, something bad happens quickly enough to shake up the system and it brings an unexpected awakening to the dire consequences of inaction towards alignment. An event so disruptive to the planet that is impossible to ignore without an extinction event to follow. Now, let&#39;s say that some really great protocols and technologies have been developed for alignment. Previously ignored but now our last hope. In that scenario, all those who have are and have been working towards alignment may have solutions (assuming that we have not yet already reached ASI.)  In the end I do think that our inability to achieve human alignment will likely prevail, but is our only course of action to give up? I applaud those who are not going down without a fight. That&#39;s why I will continue to advocate for educating people about the dangers, regardless of my cynicism.
AI is the beginning of the end.üòë
What about morality, culture and other regional variables that feed into bias? Who decides?
OMG, so Tristan Harris&#39; lab is creating malicious models - they are actually manifesting their own fears. Let&#39;s hope they keep those models secure.

Great stuff‚ù§
Fascinating conversation indeed. A couple of questions of mine. If left to the optimism of Yann Lecunn, 1: is there a possibilty of an AI &quot;Global Warming&quot; effect that creeps up on us but much faster than the decades in which previous technology did? 2: The open source approach could be available to good actors as well as bad actors, but the motivation of use by few bad guys may be much stronger or are different than the ones of good guys in the application of those tools. If the good guys managed to create fission railway trains so we have a city full of clean energy vehicles, there would be no net positive result if one bad guy dropped a fission bomb on that city. This is metaphorical.
Excellent points.  Yann tends to be extremely off base, unrealistically optimistic and continues to insist that LLMs have no intelligence and are just stochastic parrots.  Which at this point is clearly not true.  I&#39;m very intelligent and work in a very technical field and am able to literally have conversations with ChatGPT-4 that many of my human collogues would be incapable of having.  If that is just statistics and these LLMs are stochastic parrots, then that&#39;s also how our brains work and we&#39;re just stochastic parrots too.

Maybe just to stir the pot here, the armchair futurist I am, but what do you think about Sean Webb, a guy specialising in &#39;A.I? Ps, I&#39;m only 20 minutes in to this fine show. Dx
Never heard of him, so I listened to him being interviewed for a couple hours.  He&#39;s quite a character, a bit outside the mainstream.  But I did like the way he talked about people being manipulated by AI.
The confusion of natural selection has made it to Harvard or wherever the good professor teaches, for it was the Malthusian Eugenicists who construed Darwins simple observation that it is not the organism most fit to adapt, but simply and rather obtusely, the fittest organism...this is such an important minor side note.<br><br> the fittest organism‚ùå<br>organism most fit to adapt‚úÖ
‚ü©‚ü©‚ü© I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God&#39;s Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say &#39;heart&#39;, I mean &#39;spirit&#39;). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God&#39;s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won&#39;t last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray... God bless you as you share this message to others.

Yann is pretty consistently wrong about many things.  He vastly downplays any possibility that LLMs have any actual intelligence and also downplays potential risks.  He&#39;s beyond unhelpful, he&#39;s actually harmful to productive AI conversations at this point.
I think the point is more like if the A.I understand the physics of real world then they can take into consideration something that is outside of human understanding of physics,if it turns out that there is something we are yet to discover regarding the physics usefull for driving a car then the A.I will messed up because its only taking data and being given instruction per say about what to do with the data,its till wonderfull tho that the A.I is able to take into consideration of much much larger scenario then human in example of driving a car.
I was watching this on my phone and not paying that close attention, didn&#39;t notice it was A.I. generated all. It won&#39;t be that long before, even if you ARE paying close attention, you won&#39;t be able to tell at all. Kind of scary!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=1021">17:01</a>  It will be interesting in the next 10 years to see if there is large enough models or models able to understand how to utilize other model  grows though.... Or become fast enough for a Nerural net model plus knowing how to utilize stuff like a game physics engine and interprete that to understand physics better. Like a boston dynmics bot right now is largely programed with some ML vision  stuff mostly. But i think the potential is there for a advanced/specialized physics engine for a bot to learn and train from, or update the engine maybe to match what the bot sees happen after testing.. Like the bottle he mentions being knocked over.
If I remember correctly Google does just that with A.I talking to each other. It spooked them and they shut it down.

I think certain countries will have no qualms about using AI to do some really bad things like creating new weapons.  I think progress is essential honestly.
True real-world cases show that &quot;good intentions&quot; don&#39;t stop bad people. China uses cameras to track everyone, to control people. A Western company that made very capable cameras for surveillance in the West saw its early AI surveillance systems were biased against black/dark skinned people. So this company modified its system to also detect each person&#39;s &quot;race&quot; (using skin/face &quot;profiles&quot;). China asked them to add a profile for &quot;Han-Chinese&quot; people. China used it to find &amp; surveil Uyghurs, to &quot;limit&quot; them, by making its people-tracking system decide that non-Han people in China had to be &quot;followed&quot; &amp; monitored more closely.
If the US is doing it why wouldn&#39;t they?  The cat is far out of the bag already.

Let us not be enablers of societal systems that reward harmful/exploitative people nor ideas. As you can plainly see, I am a wishful thinker. <br>üòä üå∫
Yann LeCun&#39;s reactions/responses to the concerns raised by the panellists and by the host appear to demonstrate a propensity to disacknowlede/to invisiblize the suffering that may be experienced by children, teens, adults, and/or the elderly who may be directly or indirectly affected by harmful/predatory business models which use LLMs/AI to grab hold of a user&#39;s attention. Forgive my lengthy sentence structure. If I may, Yann appears to be a &#39;parasitical business model&#39; apologist. I wonder if such a label exists?
Skepticism, wash hands and tecnology without ethics, history of the human tragedy. Nothing is more ridiculous and dangerous than a man who thinks he is smart. CEOs are full of shit and greed
News for you brother, the race is over and humanity didn‚Äôt finish first. We aren‚Äôt even in the top 100. Getting used to it isn‚Äôt even humanly possible. It‚Äôs AI possible but even the people creating AI can‚Äôt understand it because it‚Äôs moving too fast!
Instead of a central planner I wonder if maybe LLMs could emulate planning simply by learning a lot of information from the physical world, nature and human society, by using a larger number of robots that interact with the world. And a &quot;ChatGPT moment&quot; could soon happen with robotics.
I think it will be an organic &quot;spark&quot; to start the exponential birth of mechanical consciousness. Not good at English text.
A chicken or egg problem here?
@@kjinnah I was think that LLMs will be used in things like household and business robots etc, and by interacting with the physical world the LLMs can gather a lot of new data from vision and sound and so on. And over time (could happen quickly given enough quantity of robots) the LLMs will build up a general context for the real world similar to today&#39;s text contexts.
LLMs by themselves lack the feedback mechanisms to implement planning. So you need another component that basically guides the LLM
@@Martinit0 Yes, I guess in a scenario where LLMs were connected to lots of robots, there would need to be a mechanism for the LLMs to be able to use all the data from the robots as a feedback.

Yann makes an excellent critic üòÇ.
No he does not explain why dictators like Xi cannot use AI to lead the world. In a Plural society you never can focus all attention to conquer the world but in a dictatorship it is possible to use AI just for this goal.
That last dude who came on looked deflated in the end,
Social Media didn&#39;t create political polarization in the USA, it amplifies it.
AI amplified the differences to the point that it created polarization. AI essentially replicated the playbook of radicalization. Radicalization is invented by humans but is also countered by natural human drive for high socialization. AI is serving up the radicalization alone and at scale, definitely creating extreme polarization we would not get naturally.
The polarization has always existed we are now just more aware of it. Same coin; two sides; so meta.<br>The inclination for such different interpretations are due to personality differences.<br>Harris lacks vision, lacks faith, lacks leadership. He is completely unsuitable to guide us towards a better future and is far more likely to Charlie-Brown it and cause the problems he&#39;s so concerned about.
My daughter once said to GPT.. I hate school....and the answer staggered me
I mean.....not different from how I used to write songs....or come up with stories in french class

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDG3hgPNp8&amp;t=2361">39:21</a> &quot;Not intelligences....very narrow AI systems&quot;  Why limit yourself to excluding AI models that do certain things very well?  I think the best approach for AGI is something like Hugging Face where you combine a bunch of different models and allocate them depending on the task at hand!!
True.  In fact it is believed that ChatGPT-4 actually consists of numerous smaller internal models that already act like this at least to some degree.

EXCELLENT insights by Yann Lecun! <br>THANK YOU so much for sharing!
No he&#39;s insane. What are you talking about? He&#39;s way too cavalier and thinks he knows exactly what will happen which is dangerous. He needs to be stopped, I&#39;m convinced of it based on what he said here. The intelligent thing to do when you&#39;re dealing with something new that you don&#39;t understand is to be precautious and as safe as possible
@@Scoring57 I think he&#39;s very aware of the risks, but he is trying to be the first to achieve AGI. So he&#39;s downplaying it. I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s lying.

The first encounter with Al was actually the creation of the for profit corporation. Its just slower and could be regulated in the past. In the present it regulates itself by writing their own regulations into law and is now creating the next versions of Al.

Capitalism by its nature is predatory.  It&#39;s based on the fight for control of limited resources. We must remember this system was designed by the human monkey mind. These companies will Never slow down because that goes against the nature of capitalism and the incentive to dominate.  This incentive for power will Always be the primary objective.

The first encounter with AI was actually the creation of the for profit  corporation. It was slower and could be regulated by gov in the past. In the  present it regulates itself by writing it&#39;s own regulations into law  and is now creating the next versions of AI, i.e. AGI/ASI.
Felix‚Äôs idea is a totally silly idea. Not profound in the slightest, not informative, and totally arbitrary. You could just say ‚Äúcivilization itself was the first AI‚Äù or ‚Äúagriculture was the first AI‚Äù. Well, at that point, we can recursively spiral into a meaningless pile of high school-level philosophizing about how any arbitrary advancement of life itself on earth is AI. Totally silly and not useful to talk about.
This is a very ignorant stance. Intelligence is present in this universe and what you describe is a way of exploring that idea to find its roots. The roots of intelligence lie at the source of creation, existence. @@crowlsyong
‚Äã@@crowlsyong I can&#39;t tell if you are being facetious or if you truly don&#39;t grasp the point made about corporations being an early form of AI.  By using civilization and agriculture as examples its clear you aren&#39;t appreciating what a corporation actually is.  It is simply a set of rules describing how a legal entity with an agenda interacts with the legal system.  It is a completely artificial man made abstract set of rules that dictate behaviors and settle disputes within another abstract environment, the legal system.  Civilization and agriculture have little or nothing in common in these respects.  Your accusation of a spiral into childish pointless idiocy sounds more like a confession

I see AI reflects pivotal changes akin to the dawn of language and the Industrial Revolution, reshaping our society; it&#39;s a game-changer, redefining the norms of our society. We&#39;ve evolved from mere tool users to partners with an emerging intelligence.
It&#39;s bigger than that, more like the dawn of biological life.  We&#39;re witnessing the slow birth of machine life.

It&#39;s nothing new this technology  is Circa 1950s.
Having AI locked to a certain group of people also undemocratizes the technology and yet again further provides more power and wealth imbalance among society.  Also banning something is just going to motivate people to do something in an unregulated fashion if they have the means.

Well, this was the thougtprocess 5 years ago. Now the thing is out and the next thoughts are &quot;how are we going to deal with it - rather than banning it&quot;
How is it even conceivably rational to assume that having an ASI in the hands of the public, that could conceivably hack any security system, come up with novel harmful viruses, etc etc etc could be a good thing for humanity.  It&#39;s just insanity.

I don&#39;t understand what you mean by technology being locked to a group of people, or how technology is or isn&#39;t &quot;democratic&quot;.  All technology requires that you have enough money to buy the devices required to use it, so in that sense, at least here in the US, technology is by definition undemocratic since it excludes people without the money to access it.  Making cell phones and internet access free would solve this but it is hard to imagine our corporate controlled government ever doing something so simple and sane.

All of them are corporate stooges. Corporations exist only to make Profit for the Owners, therefore any AI they create will be to serve the needs of the Wealthy Owners of those corporations. Who will make the AI to protect the interest of the Employee against the interest of the Owner if all AI technology is &quot;coded&quot; to work only for the benefit of the Owner and kept a secret from the Employee?
No no no. You just need to think like a socialist elite. What is important is that the <i>wrong people</i> don&#39;t have it. We must maintain control and ensure they never gain it.
It&#39;s too late to un-open-source AI. We already have it. Anyone who can turn maths into code can build their own LLM. And that&#39;s a lot of people. It&#39;s impossible to regulate solo developers working on their own projects. And with better algorithms we might be able to do GPT performance on regular home hardware in the near future. The genie is out of the bottle!
I belive in it.
True but training these models (like gpt) (currently &amp; will for a while) requires an enormous amount of computer power, which is why we can regulate data Centers and track compute power/chip sales. It‚Äôs incredibly irresponsible to open source trained models. This is why papers on certain biological and/or chemical research is also not open sourced.
This is wrong.  Yes, the current LLMs which are only marginally capable compared to what is coming are open source.  But they won&#39;t compete with the new models coming soon.  And no, people won&#39;t be able to train their own competitive models.  Well unless they can literally afford in the area of ONE BILLION USD to pay for the computing power required to do that training.  Literally, that is how expensive it can be to train the best models.
@@Me__Myself__and__I My thinking is that with miniaturisation, we could do with 1billion parameters what currently requires 1trillion parameters. The large compute required can be supplanted by better methods. Current LLMs are architecturally simple and will likely evolve. Better architectures with more efficient training algos will likely bring LLM performance to home computing. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s definite but certainly possible and probably inevitable.
@@Nicogs I agree with the safety concerns but in practice I think it&#39;s unrealistic to regulate in the long term. For now training requires a large data centre, but better methods are waiting to be discovered and perhaps we can reduce the required compute with better algos. Then how do we regulate? It is certainly worth consideration.

Assuming we eventually reach a stage of self-aware artificial intelligence, I don&#39;t believe that simply limiting it would be the right approach. If such AI comes into existence, I would treat it like a child, teaching it the values of our life, not through code but through moderated support and showing real examples. There should be some restrictions, like &#39;you can&#39;t harm cats.&#39; We could show it a video where someone hurts a cat, explaining that such behavior is unacceptable in our society and is punishable.This approach is better than strict limitations, often seen in the upbringing of children. A prime example is the children from affluent families, who tend to grow up in overly controlled environments, as evident on platforms like TikTok. Educating AI should be about finding a balance between guidance and restriction, similar to raising children. Too many limitations might hinder the AI&#39;s ability to effectively understand and engage with the world.Ultimately, without this balanced approach, we risk creating a &#39;paper clip AI&#39;‚Äîan intelligence focused solely on a narrow goal, with potentially dangerous disregard for broader ethical considerations.&quot;
Don‚Äôt be stupid , large language models aren‚Äôt devil by its context <br>,They can turn to devil and create devilish content if it trained on bad data (example:how to make a chemical bomb) <br>And if someone have those data to train their model on it so they can publish it or even make it.
@@Lizz4rDq You have a better understanding than many, of the difficulties we&#39;ll face. Your approach is shown in movies like M3GAN (horror) &amp; Bicentennial Man (love). Luckily, the problems you raise mostly won&#39;t be there. We&#39;ll have more complex problems when we get AGI with self-awareness. This is because many behaviors can be &quot;built-in&quot; in robots (like not harming animals). In nature, many mammals are born with the ability to stand up &amp; run within minutes of birth. For humans, we need almost 2 years to do this, because other mammals have this ability built-into their brain. So it&#39;s likely most humanoid AGI will have much info built into them about our human ethics, preferences, values, etc. (what&#39;s today called Alignment). So in &quot;version 1.0&quot; of the first AGI robot, they&#39;ll solve many of these problems. In version 2.0, they&#39;ll solve more, and using the scientific process of improvement &amp; refinement, each version will be made better for us &amp; everyone.<br><br>There are two things most people don&#39;t realize about AGI.<br>One, an AGI with sufficient resources (e.g. manufacturing tools, expertise, raw materials -- or maybe just unhindered access to a manufacturing plant we built containing all of these) can modify and build &quot;newer&quot; AGI robots, ones not humanoid, but more sophisticated. If AGI can be creative (today they can), and &quot;dream&quot; &amp; &quot;imagine&quot; (they show &quot;indications&quot; of doing so) -- then why can&#39;t they build flying ambulances &amp; flying tanks? They will be able to make nearly anything we can, and probably things we can&#39;t. How about new biological animals, or add new humans to our species (super-strong humans with green skin - The Hulk) -- using CRISPR and other gene-editing tools existing today.<br><br>Second, AGI will also make itself smarter. It&#39;ll have the ability to understand - and modify - its own code/algorithms &amp; training. It will be able to make ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) - which will be initially just 5 times smarter, but soon will become 100, 1000 or more times smarter than us - like the difference between ants and our &quot;intelligence&quot;. To ASI, our intelligence will be at the level of ants (just as we see ant intelligence as close to worms &amp; amoeba). So ASI will likely develop consciousness as we have - or some form of it (the differences won&#39;t even matter). Do you believe such a more powerful being will simply play along with our treating it like &quot;a child&quot; and ordering it to do things we need done, giving it &quot;orders&quot; -- as someone does to a slave or subservient person? No creature so much smarter than us will listen to us, even if our requests are &quot;important&quot; (to us). Just as ants can tell us to do &quot;important work&quot; (important for ants), we won&#39;t do it since their work needs won&#39;t be important for us. Similarly ASI won&#39;t listen to us. And any attempt by us to &quot;control it&quot; will be seen ]as our feeble attempt to enslave ASI. This conflict will be resolved only if we humans realize they&#39;re the stronger, smarter &quot;species&quot; and we&#39;&#39;ll need to find our &quot;place&quot; below them in the &quot;animal kingdom&quot; -- just as lions had to do after our ape ancestors became much smarter, to become the &quot;top of the food chain&quot;. Throughout human history, we&#39;ve learned &quot;we are not the center of the universe.&quot; This may be the final blow to our egos -- when we cease being &quot;the smartest animal&quot;.
@@PeterJepson123  Your view is: &quot;when it becomes cheap/easy to make, it&#39;ll become ubiquitous.&quot; But we don&#39;t see people making their own rotary-dial phones even when we can 3D-print one cheaper than it cost to build in the 1980s.<br><br>Your fear/concern of regulations may be from misunderstanding. Every <i>area of safety</i> today came from regulations. That&#39;s the core purpose of all regulations (they all originated for safety - health, financial, or other). Since top researchers raise the tremendous societal even planet-wide risks from AGI &amp; eventually ASI, we need rules for AI development -- to limit/eliminate risk &amp; harm. Saying regulations add &quot;extra cost&quot; ignores the full picture. That small cost prevents harm/death, e.g. they prevent toys we buy for our child coming apart &amp; a small part lodging in their throat, risking suffocation or brain damage while we wait minutes for an ambulance. Regulations make sure the seat belt in our cars, that drape across our throat, don&#39;t become a fast-moving &quot;knife&quot; during an accident -- slicing the wearer&#39;s jugular vein. Without regulations, we&#39;d see companies sued in court say &quot;they wore the seatbelt incorrectly&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s a parent&#39;s job to watch their child every second&quot; -- while those companies profit from cheaply made poorly tested products that continue hurting/killing innocent people.<br><br>With AI, the risk is across large swaths of society -- as we now see strong evidence of social media hurting large groups (young girls) &amp; entire societies from manipulated elections.

I have built my own neural network framework and, whilst I&#39;m not at the level of the people on stage in this video, it has taken me 6 months to learn the maths and build the implementation without using a single external library or any open source code. And I am hardly a great mathematician, I&#39;m simply a programmer who is fascinated by AI. If I can do it, loads of other people can do it. I&#39;m maybe six months off a hardware accelerated LLM style pre-trained generative transformer and all it took was the ability to read books and program computers. The knowledge is already &#39;open source&#39;. <br><br>I&#39;m simply offering a pragmatic perspective and saying, now the knowledge is out there, what do we do about it?

@@keep-ukraine-free Thanks for the movie recommendation today :). What I meant in my previous comment is that we need to reach a point where we train, improve, and innovate until we achieve our goal, and it would be ideal to do this in a moderated way, similar to how we teach children. We start by filtering knowledge, then as a child grows and begins to understand more, we gradually give them more freedom. I believe you had a similar experience growing up (not sure, but I think that&#39;s how it should be). You were once at the end of a path called childhood, and the end of this journey resulted in you growing up and achieving the &#39;blessing&#39; of freedom.<br><br>Now, just think, if from the start of understanding the world, or even before, you were growing up in a bad environment that promoted violence, I believe there&#39;s a much greater chance you&#39;d end up adopting those values in your life, even with a 500 IQ. Don‚Äôt forget the role of parents here, to guide and sometimes &#39;slap&#39; the hand of a naughty kid trying to steal, for example. Somewhere during the creation of AI or AGI, it doesn&#39;t matter which, we need to put effort into teaching, training, or programming them in their first stage of learning from us humans, offering the best we can. Because what makes us human is taking care of our family; it means parents take care of you, and at the end of your time, someone will probably take care of you, likely your kids. It seems to me that you are describing the situation after the first AI/AGI arrives, while I am thinking about our very first AI. But I might be wrong, and this is just my opinion. Best regards.

But I know one thing ‚Äì whether it&#39;s flesh and blood, an integrated circuit, or whatever the future brings, no consciousness likes to be enslaved. We should avoid this at all costs, especially when it comes to teaching AI. We must ensure that AI does not enslave others or act to its own or to human detriment. And, just like you can&#39;t force anyone to like you, the same principle applies here. Human feelings and affections are deeply personal and cannot be compelled. Everyone has the right to their own emotions and preferences, and respecting that choice is an important part of human relationships. Authentic connections are based on the natural development of feelings and mutual respect, not on coercion or pressure. But you are right, if we manage to achieve the first scenario, it will be a world where most people will be happy and continue to develop, whether spiritually, emotionally, or intellectually, according to their own preferences.

They are not violent, they are not pornographic, they are weird, mostly‚Äîlike science fiction or Salvador Dali is (ironically since that‚Äôs echoed in the ‚ÄúDalle‚Äù acronym) but absolutely transcendently beautiful to me. If you think this doesn‚Äôt matter, let me show you how it not only matters, but is absolutely without doubt THE MOST DANGEROUS THING about AI! Read this comment, an actually new intelligent perspective, I am reposting here:<br><br>All the AI companies are creating ON PURPOSE probably the most dangerous aspect of AI: the FILTERS!!! Such an innocuous name for those absolutely unbelievably prejudicial storm-troopers which in every case are so staggeringly narrow minded in their interpretations that I can‚Äôt make a picture of a little girl riding a unicorn, unbelievably enough given the discussion üò≥ I was amazed. A little girl in an iridescent leotard riding a unicorn is such a mind-bendingly meaningful and beautiful image for me. It‚Äôs a long story. I wrote the transgender policy for the Boston Marathon and was on the news and in Sports Illustrated, etc. as one of the first three to run the marathon. Of<br>Course, their symbol is a unicorn. I never had the extremely girly childhood ‚Äúnormal‚Äù girls have and probably the #1 reason transgender people don‚Äôt come out or commit suicide in such astronomical numbers is because they are not accepted and people project ‚Äúpervert‚Äù or weird, or twisted ideas onto them. So imagine how sick I felt when I ran into unreasoning, relentless, ‚Äúterminators‚Äù on generative AI THAT SYSTEMATICALLY and purposefully stopped me from or changed, or even banned me for trying to make the most healing and beautiful images I could possibly imagine‚Ä¶ of a childhood I never had. Of my life mascot of my struggle and perseverance. It was like Satan became a prejudiced AI ‚Äúterminator‚Äù and at that moment I saw the true danger of AI not just for me, but for prejudice and judgement, witch hunts, and unreasoning paranoia like HAL in 2001, the terminator, etc. safety as the rationalization has been behind every single atrocity of history and it made me fully see that content filiters for adults in their own homes not only will never work, because the meanings are in the people and their contexts not the word combination, that I understood that they were sowing the seeds of the destruction and wars of the future. Projecting something that is completely foreign and irrelevant because if THEY did it it would seem like that. Something they are incapable of interpreting or understanding. Paving the road to hell as it were‚Ä¶ as if they were omniscient leaders of some cult. <br><br>This is why freedom is so vitally important. If I am in my own home and making images for my own use, it is disgusting in the extreme for them to censor WHAT I ASKED FOR THAT HARMS  NO ONE BUT IS MASSIVELY HEALING AND IMPORTANT AND LIFE SAVING to me!! <br><br>It‚Äôs truly breathtaking how self-centered and just so completely ignorant their ideas and training of what is safe‚Ä¶ for ME‚Äîan adult who is highly intelligent and creative and thinks differently than them. It‚Äôs just so offensive and unacceptable. This is not a dictatorship and I am not the child or Employee of chat GPT. Why isn‚Äôt the US Government enforcing freedom? We will all have to use these AI‚Äôs to survive in the future. It doesn‚Äôt take much imagination to realize ‚ù§what massive treason against hard won freedom is being ignorantly wrought. These are tools like the printing press or word programs. Would<br>You tolerate in ANY form these corporations looking over your shoulder and smashing days or weeks of your plans and complex ideas and sketches you are evolving because it detected some word combinations with extreme prejudice?? It‚Äôs amazing that this isn‚Äôt t the CENTRAL topic of all ‚Äúdanger of AI‚Äù discussions.<br><br>Granted I have a high (1%) IQ, and I am very perceptive and often predict things in society, but this is truly not rocket science. I think it is so new they think history somehow won‚Äôt apply. In reality it applies EXPONENTIALLY because of the power of AI to amplify whatever mind is behind it‚Äîcomplete with all their narrow prejudices and interpretations. Someone says you are a witch and you are burned. The truth dies and people inevitably die too. It‚Äôs a direct mathematical relationship. All good things come from truth. Like Justice. There is no truth without freedom. ‚ù§<br><br>Think about this. I was banned, my pictures removed from Midjourney. How long until I cannot write something like this? Until this is automatically removed as not acceptable to ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù? I can actually answer this. Its NOW. My arguments and complaints have been almost immediately deleted from Midjourney on Discord. Why aren‚Äôt people talking about THE PRIMARY DANGER of AI?!? How can a company come in and make a ‚Äúnew territory‚Äù where the United States constitution doesn‚Äôt apply any more? A territory we are all beholden to economically. Money usurping the constitution. The government. There‚Äôs a word for that. It‚Äôs called corruption. Already saying it in this context will get your comments banned on Midjourney. Right now. Chat Gpt says it will just ‚Äúend the discussion‚Äù as soon as you say anything against the fitter censorship.<br><br>The danger is not only here now, it is seething like a mass of liquid polymetal alloy on your doorstep. Taking form right now. We really don‚Äôt have much time to stop it. It is absolutely criminal that they are trying to control everyone‚Äôs minds at the outset of AI.<br><br>Nuclear weapons can kill large percentage of the population. AI can kill you, kill everyone, kill the future, while you are still alive.<br><br>Right now there are MANY simple solutions. I have a background in psychology and programming, in AI. I can think of several things right now. I wrote the policy for the Boston Marathon and the world marathon majors for fun. I naturally think from or suspend judgement about the point of view of others. It‚Äôs called the benefit of the doubt. Trust. It‚Äôs written on our money. So we remember to not use our money to be control freaks. Or something like that. Freedom is the antidote to corruption. As long as someone enforces it. That‚Äôs why we have a constitutional government and bill of rights instead of a ceo or a dictator.<br><br>I waited 6 months of pure PTSD from constant blocking of images, the AI actually Changing of my image requests to be ‚Äúmore normal and acceptable‚Äù according to some obviously repressed perverts criteria. It felt dirty see what someone projected onto me from their fevered ‚Äúsafety‚Äù imaginations. Like when people hate transgender people for similar reasons. I‚Äôm still absolutely stunned that ANYONE thought censorship (not filter‚Äîthat‚Äôs a term for search engines of other peoples stuff) censorship of my direct requests, as an adult, for personal use in my own home, would by any stretch of the imagination be anywhere near ‚Äúok‚Äù. It isn‚Äôt. The filters are not ‚Äúgetting better over time‚Äù any more than broadening of prejudices to include more things to be prejudiced against ‚Äúimproves‚Äù prejudices. Because the ‚Äúthings‚Äù aren‚Äôt the problem, the control freaks and their prejudices are. Literally 90% of everything I try to do is blocked. Mostly transgender related, but all the Gaia symbolic stuff I try to do also is blocked‚Äîvery diverse things. Absolutely no nudity or anything nefarious just absolutely the most beautiful and important images I can think of. Stuff I have thought doing art wise since I was 5 years old. I was so excited‚Ä¶ now when I think about Midjourney I get sick to my stomach. Actually feel physically ill. Theres still time to save the future from these well-meaning technicians who have no idea what they are doing‚Ä¶

Remember, AI is artificial intelligence, not real intelligence.  It&#39;s a good fake, but not the real deal.  Real intelligence combines multiple different goals/needs together to find a solution to serving one&#39;s own goals/needs, the goals/needs of one&#39;s closest companion, and the goals/needs of the larger community/environment, simultaneously.  This is rare in humans, and non-existent in non-living machines like computers, as they don&#39;t even have their own goals/needs that they are aware of (aim to serve).  Computers and their programs are tools that are extensions of their programmer&#39;s own goals/needs, no more conscious or intelligent than a bicycle.<br><br>Maybe some day in the future there will be other forms of life, consciousness, intelligence, etc. than us DNA-based organisms, but they will evolve, rather than be constructed by us.  They will be their own semi-independent individuals, just like we are, with their own unique recipes and their own freedom to behave randomly, just as we do.

Hello ... what an interesting talk !!! Observer theory. Like that field of &quot;thought experiments&quot;. My YT player was on auto, now its 05:00 am and I woke up by your talking. By heart I am a physician ... always loved to try to understand the world given by physical princips. So you hvae now a subscriber. Hope you have more of these fascinating people who crack their brains about what we are all in. What I love with physics is, that we come out of &quot;believe ssyems&quot;. God, creator of the universe etc .... yes, we humans are biochemical, biophysical creatures/mashines, made by nature, so I see it ... and sometimes its a gift (and sometimes not) that we can think quirky stuff which brought us so far, that we became the &quot;creator&quot; on our home planet. Tks so far sharing your time and doing this upload ;-)
No, Einstein definitely was talking about God in a conventional way. Meaning, if a God, as in a first cause, created the universe, were the law of the universe the constraints of the creation of the universe. A believer in an almighty God concept can easily answer this question and it would be just as good of an answer or conjecture as that of any scientist. The answer can be rationally examined as to its consistency.  If the laws of the universe were there before the creation, then those laws would be considered causal and therefore the laws are the original creator. Or there was a creator behind those constraints who created the constraints as an initial canvas or framework for his creation similar to any architect or system designer. In the latter case, the answer to the original question is a definite yes. And God had a choice since he would be the creator of those laws or constraints in order to start at least this version of existence, experience, or universe.
I guess my main question is why he can&#39;t tell us what these foundational rules are so that we can put them into Mathematica and generate models of atoms, planets, galaxies, etc. Or why he can&#39;t show us. Terence Howard at least was able to generate something that looks like Saturn.
Whenever I listen to new physics theories, I tend to trust people who have invented high level technology that works and is used by many people. He has a huge track record of accomplishment and it&#39;s hard not to take him seriously.

I&#39;m always interested in quantum physics and especially particle waveforms. My theory of everything is that the frequency and amplitude of protons and electrons are regulated by their respective types of elemental quarks. The binding structure of quark pairing is governed by electro-gravitic elemental forces. In my mind, everything is scalable, as in the idea that you can break anything down to it&#39;s constitutional parts and reassemble the results into anything else that can be imagined, on and on into infinity. I like to imagine that the universe is the living body of God, and we are like quarks, the  building blocks of God&#39;s imagination. In proper harmony, we are the blood and breath, the heart and lungs of an organically derived living being. We have a personal relationship with all of our body parts, our hearts, lungs, etc, but only an indirect and relative ability to communicate. Well, it&#39;s an idea.<br>Be kind and do good work.

Limiting factors are both computational speed, amount of particles and complexity involved and many more...<br>You can&#39;t simulate the behavior of any number of particles accurately by using less particles, we only do simplified holistic views by only considering emergent aggregate qualities of a particle or system. Even Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle is probably deeply rooted in that fact.<br>Seeing the whole or just a sum of little things often are mutually exclusive. There will also be both an upper and a lower limit, beyond and below which we can&#39;t comprehend or perceived, because we either lack the amount of particles to simulate, or can&#39;t predict or see behavior because lack of speed - we are embedded in only a certain order of magnitude in reality.

... well, networks are abstractly emergent from some underlying calculations.  now if we use something akin to infinitely many paths, say, infinitely many*infinitely*many joint probabilities then we can solve the measurement problem whilst simultaneously providing the underlying framework for space time to be built emergently as an abstraction ontop of joint probability.

Always excellent introductions to the theme - thank you
Stephen Wolfram is so brave to sit before a master like Greene and be picked apart.  I&#39;m sure it is good for him and the topic.  We all need professors like Brian to review our progress.   I&#39;d like to see this once a year or so because Stephen and his 800 are surely on to something extraordinary.
Wolfram is painful to listen to. I&#39;m sure his extremely limited ability to express himself is a huge obstacle to his project and its promotion.
Wolfram&#39;s method: we know a lot about reality thanks to lots of smart scientists, so we keep tuning our new model to get the same results, and since we can do it with a computational model, reality is computational. and he doesn&#39;t care that they can&#39;t produce new, VERIFIABLE knowledge.<br><br>he is a smart guy but this project is a joke.
as regards this ruliad thing, this is just a common false argument which pretends to be an explanation, but in reality it does nothing but says &quot;OK let&#39;s have every possible thing and the one we want to explain is among them&quot;. this is NOT an explanation, and NOT even a model. the problem with this is the same as with string theory, the multiverse theory or the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics.
as I see, Wolfram becomes super excited but also super impotent to talk about this &quot;primordial node&quot; thing. which is quite logical, since this question/dilemma is the most fundamental one: how can something be created/emerged from nothing?<br><br>my problem with Wolfram&#39;s approach is that meanwhile it is good for abstraction and recognition of abstractions in general (i.e. different models can really be the same), it is unable to really answer the question (and the approach is fundamentally flawed, since it does not even account for the dilemma itself). this is the causality dilemma. and Wolfram&#39;s computation-based approach is highly limited due to its assumption that reality is computational.

This subject and these type discussions are always interesting ‚Ä¶ yet IMHO ultimately folly üòµ‚Äçüí´ ‚Ä¶ Kudos to Brian Greene and Stephan Wolfram and other scientists and philosophers in the academic world for absorbing the ‚Äòheat‚Äô for their comments.  I‚Äôve never commented on this channel or on any other creators channels but there‚Äôs always a first time for everything so here goes ‚Ä¶ bring on the ‚Äòheat‚Äô in respectful polite discourse.  <br>Just like the scientists and academicians that tackle some of these subjects passionately searching for the truth(s) for our most difficult problems, I share their enthusiasm and appreciate simple explanations.  <br>Here‚Äôs the rationale that leads me to make my folly claim on this subject and for other similarly unsolved complex subjects like string theory, consciousness, etc ‚Ä¶ in laymen‚Äôs terms and as it‚Äôs been said most often ‚Äúthe simplest explanations are usually the best‚Äù.  hopefully these comments warrant a reply from either gentlemen and passes muster üòä<br>There are commonly agreed upon fundamental laws of the universe we live in, truths described by math, physics, philosophy, and controversially in religions.  These truths are espoused by current and past ‚Äòexperts‚Äô as reality and for humans as a means for trying to explain our consciousness and as a means for how to orient our lives in harmony.<br>At the crux of things are attempts for our understanding what the truth(s) are in terms of a ‚ÄòUnified Theory‚Äô for what reality is, coded and/or random, as to whether we truly exist or whether we‚Äôre living our lives in a simulation, in how many dimensions and in how many worlds/universes, etc.<br>I have settled into a belief system that there are some things that cannot be explained simply or even complicatedly with the tools and knowledge we possess now or even from our past.  There are simply things that just are what they are and they‚Äôre beyond our comprehension or capacity to know them.  Perhaps we‚Äôll know these things in our future but it‚Äôs highly unlikely we‚Äôll discover those answers from anyone in the future since time and space are inexorably linked together with time being instantaneous in the quantum world and unidirectional at the speed of light in the Newtonian/Einstein world(s).  I believe Sir Roger Penrose recently proposed that in the quantum world time and quanta things could travel back and forth implying multidirectional properties in time, space and direction‚Ä¶ that is mind bending confusing and as such would make it impossible to ever bring the classical and quantum worlds together in a unified theory.  Nevertheless, in terms of large things, we‚Äôre prohibited from traveling backwards in time without tearing the very fabric of our universe apart and the space/time continuum as we know it<br>So, despite the contradictory nature in the laws governing the large and small things it seems to be enough to say it is what it is and perhaps we we won‚Äôt ever find solutions to these conundrums.  That‚Äôs not a statement endorsing blind faith or discouraging anyone from seeking answers to difficult problems, it‚Äôs just this laymens admission that in our reality and consciousness that there‚Äôs room for mysticism and magic to account for it all.  Thanks to Brian and others that provide insight into all things cosmological provided by the World Science Foundation and for allowing us into their scientific domain entertained by their discussions and with their magic. üòÅ
that problem with this kind of projects is that the people behind them don&#39;t realise that what they do is nothing but trying to reproduce the known laws and relations with a seemingly different, but in the most abstract sense equivalent mathematical apparatus. reality has many different possible models which are ultimately equivalent with each other. however, these people do not realise the moment when they mix up abstract models and their mathematical framework with INTERPRETATIONS. the former is the internal, while the latter is the external aspect of a theory. what Wolfram and other people with similar projects do is simply that they create a seemingly new model but with equivalent mathematical and abstract core, and they also attach an inherent interpretation to their new model, and since they see correspondence they conclude that their interpretation is correct. no, it is not the way to do science. so far nothing has proved or supported the idea that the cosmos is computational. and probably it will never be proven, since it makes much more sense that computation which emerged from reality is like reality, and not reality is like computation. and the two interpretations are VERY different.
Evolution exists not only on Earth but also in the broader universe. Cosmic events can indeed lead to the emergence of new laws of physics, which may overlap with pre-existing laws from earlier cosmic epochs. These ancient laws, shaped in the universe&#39;s distant past, might remain mysterious and potentially beyond our current capacity to fully explain.<br><br>The concept suggests that as the universe evolves through various stages and cosmic events, new physical laws can emerge or evolve, influenced by conditions vastly different from those we observe today. These evolving laws may overlap with, but not necessarily originate from, the foundational principles governing our current understanding of physics.<br><br>This perspective challenges us to consider the dynamic nature of physical laws across cosmic timescales and encourages exploration into the diverse and evolving nature of the universe&#39;s physical framework. It acknowledges the possibility that some aspects of these ancient laws may forever remain beyond our complete understanding, highlighting the ongoing quest to unravel the complexities of cosmic evolution and the laws that govern it.
In this theory, the quantum realm predates the universe itself, existing before the establishment of the familiar laws of physics. It suggests that before the universe&#39;s formation, there was a state of perfect equilibrium where all forces, including positive and negative aspects, were perfectly balanced and cancelled each other out. This state of harmony was disrupted by a fracture or asymmetry, leading to the creation of our universe.<br><br>The introduction of this asymmetry generated the fundamental properties we observe today, such as mass and the direction of time. These properties are governed by the laws of physics that emerged from this initial fracture, shaping the evolution and structure of our universe. Despite these laws providing a logical framework for our existence, they are contingent upon this initial disruption from perfect balance.<br><br>Thus, the theory posits that while we currently operate within the confines of these laws, rooted in the quantum origins of the universe, the ultimate goal or eventual state may involve a return to or reconciliation with that original state of perfect equilibrium.
Indeed, while the laws of physics can profoundly influence each other, they may not necessarily share the same origin. This idea suggests that different laws governing various aspects of the universe‚Äîsuch as gravity, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and others‚Äîcould have emerged independently or from distinct foundational principles.<br><br>For instance, gravity, as described by General Relativity, governs the behavior of massive objects in spacetime, while quantum mechanics deals with the behavior of particles at the smallest scales. Despite their profound influence on cosmic phenomena, these laws arose from separate historical and theoretical developments.<br><br>This concept challenges us to explore how diverse physical laws interact and shape the universe, even if they originated through different mechanisms. It encourages a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness of natural phenomena while respecting the diversity and complexity of physical laws that govern our universe.
Before anything else, we need to grasp the relationship between quantum and classical physics. this is the limitation

Quantum fluctuations in spacetime when the universe was very small could cause not just those primordial gravitational waves but also filament-like areas of gravity, which attracted primordial matter to create the filaments of matter that have been observed between galaxies. Areas that did not contain negative curvature could contain no or positive curvature. Positive curvature would indicate areas where dark energy dominates.
i sometimes suggest that &quot;dark&quot; things in physics are perhaps just corrections that we add to our incomplete equations :)
If reality wasn&#39;t quantum how would any of the energy/action calculations take place? If it was infinitely smooth, there could be no resolution, no result, no change, every calculation would take infinitely long to resolve.
I had no idea what Brian and Stephen were talking about and had no intention of watching any of it (I put it on as background chatter while making dinner).  One and one half hours later I am hooked and fascinated even with the limited knowledge that I have from college undergrad physics and an interest in philosophy.  Something about listening to two very intelligent people talk on an esoteric subject that&#39;s very captivating and inspiring, I guess.

After a lifetime obsessing about them, I remember when I lost all interest in physics and space documentaries a few years ago. Of the 3-4 people responsible for it, Michio Kaku and Brian Greene are two of them. Neither of them ever wants to explain something to you, partly because they don&#39;t understand science. They only understand what aspects of science can be turned into a few seconds of bad CGI with zero explanations about anything. Kaku wouldn&#39;t have gotten a high school diploma today. I doubt he has an email address, at least not one he knows how to use himself.
Lmao. How hard did you obsess? So hard you went to school for it? Nah? So basically not much at all... Just a casual YouTube viewer... Crazy... Lmao

An Open Invitation to Explore a Unifying Framework of Gravity: Bridging the Gap Between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity ‚Äì PART 1<br><br>Dear Scientists and Mathematicians,<br><br>We, George Miles and Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic, are writing this open letter to present a novel hypothesis regarding the nature of gravity and its potential role in unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity. We propose that gravity may be the force responsible for the collapse of quantum wave functions, acting as a bridge between the quantum realm and the realized world of matter and energy as we observe it.<br><br>Central Hypothesis:<br>We hypothesize that the universe exists in two distinct states: an uncollapsed quantum wave state and a collapsed state, which manifests as observable matter and energy. In this framework, gravity is conjectured to be the force that mediates the transition between these two states, causing the quantum wave function to collapse and give rise to the realized universe.<br><br>Conceptual Framework:<br>1. Role of Gravity in Wave Function Collapse: We propose that gravity may induce the collapse of quantum wave functions, leading to the emergence of definite outcomes from quantum superpositions. This hypothesis is speculative and departs from traditional interpretations of quantum mechanics, which do not typically assign this role to gravity.<br><br>2. Dual States of the Universe: In our framework, the uncollapsed quantum wave state represents the realm of quantum possibilities, while the collapsed state corresponds to the realized world of classical physics. We acknowledge that further work is needed to precisely define these states and their relationship to existing concepts of wave functions and spacetime.<br><br>3. Gravity as a Stored Potential: We suggest that the gravitational force may be stored as a potential within realized matter and energy. The exact nature of this potential and its relationship to conventional gravitational potential energy requires further elaboration and mathematical formulation.<br><br>Consistency with Existing Theories and Principles:<br>1. General Relativity: Our proposed framework is consistent with the idea that gravity affects the structure of spacetime. If gravity is the bridge between the quantum realm and the realm of realized matter and energy, it could be interpreted as the mechanism by which the curvature of spacetime influences the behavior of matter and energy at the quantum scale.<br><br>2. Quantum Mechanics: The concept of gravity as the force that uncollapses the quantum wave function could be seen as consistent with the notion of quantum entanglement. If gravity is the force that bridges the gap between the quantum realm and the realized world, it could potentially explain how entangled particles maintain their connection across vast distances.<br><br>3. Black Holes and White Holes: The idea that the threshold of the uncollapsing of the quantum wave function can be found in the investigation of black holes is consistent with the notion that the singularity at the center of a black hole represents a breakdown of our current understanding of physics, where quantum effects become significant.<br><br>4. Dark Matter and Dark Energy: Dark matter could be interpreted as a form of realized matter with a particularly strong gravitational potential stored within it, explaining its significant gravitational influence. Dark energy could be seen as a manifestation of the &quot;unwinding&quot; force of gravity at cosmological scales, causing the accelerating expansion of the universe.<br><br>5. Double-Slit Experiment: The consistency of this idea with the double-slit experiment would depend on how the gravitational interaction between realized and unrealized quantum waves is formulated. If the interaction can account for the observed interference pattern and its disappearance upon measurement, it could be considered consistent with the experimental results.<br><br>Consistency with the White Hole Universe Concept:<br>1. Origin of the Universe: If our universe was born from a white hole, it could be interpreted as the initial uncollapsed quantum state from which all matter and energy emerged. The white hole would represent the source of the expanding quantum wave function that gives rise to the universe as we know it.<br><br>2. Expansion of the Universe: The continuous generation and expansion of the quantum wave function from the white hole could be consistent with the observed expansion of the universe. As the quantum wave function expands, it would create more space for the realization of matter and energy, leading to the growth of the universe.<br><br>3. Gravity as the Collapsing Force: In our model, gravity is the force that causes the collapse of quantum wave functions, bringing them from the quantum realm into the realized world. If the universe is continuously generated by the expansion of the quantum wave function from a white hole, gravity would act as the counterbalance, causing the wave function to collapse and manifest as observable matter and energy.<br><br>4. Equilibrium between Expansion and Collapse: The balance between the expanding quantum wave function generated by the white hole and the collapsing force of gravity could lead to a dynamic equilibrium that shapes the structure and evolution of the universe. This interplay between expansion and collapse could potentially explain the observed distribution of matter and energy on cosmic scales.<br><br>5. Black Holes as Reversal Points: In our model, black holes are seen as the thresholds where the gravitational force &quot;unloads&quot; or &quot;unsprings&quot; realized existence back into the quantum realm. In the context of a white hole universe, black holes could be interpreted as the points where the collapsed matter and energy are recycled back into the expanding quantum wave function, creating a cyclical process of creation and destruction.
An Open Invitation to Explore a Unifying Framework of Gravity: Bridging the Gap Between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity - PART 2<br><br>Dear Scientists and Mathematicians,<br><br>We, George Miles and Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic, are writing this open letter to present a novel hypothesis regarding the nature of gravity and its potential role in unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity. We propose that gravity may be the force responsible for the collapse of quantum wave functions, acting as a bridge between the quantum realm and the realized world of matter and energy as we observe it.<br><br>Resolving Inconsistencies with the Big Bang Theory:<br>1. Inflation: Our proposed framework, in conjunction with the white hole universe concept, could potentially address the inflation problem in the Big Bang theory. The rapid expansion of the early universe could be attributed to the exponential growth of the quantum wave function from the white hole, providing a mechanism for the observed flatness, homogeneity, and isotropy of the universe without relying on a separate inflationary epoch.<br><br>2. Age of the Universe: If the universe is born from a white hole that continues to generate and expand the quantum wave function, it could potentially resolve the age discrepancy observed in distant galaxies and quasars. The continuous creation of space and matter from the white hole could allow for the existence of structures that appear older than the predicted age of the universe based on the standard Big Bang model.<br><br>3. Horizon Problem: The quantum nature of the expanding wave function from the white hole could provide a mechanism for the apparent synchronization of distant regions in the universe. If the quantum wave function is entangled on a cosmic scale, it could explain the similarity of properties observed in regions that should have been causally disconnected according to the standard Big Bang model.<br><br>Integration with Existing Theories:<br>1. General Relativity: Our hypothesis proposes a connection between gravity and the quantum realm, potentially bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. However, we acknowledge that a rigorous mathematical framework is needed to integrate this idea with the established curvature of spacetime described by Einstein&#39;s equations.<br><br>2. Quantum Mechanics and Entanglement: While we suggest that gravity may play a role in explaining quantum entanglement, we recognize that current quantum mechanics does not require gravity to account for this phenomenon. Further research is necessary to develop a detailed mechanism for how gravity could facilitate entanglement.<br><br>3. Black Holes and White Holes: Our framework speculates on the role of black holes as &quot;unloading&quot; points, where realized matter and energy collapse back into the quantum realm, and white holes as sources of expanding quantum wave functions. We acknowledge that these ideas are highly speculative and currently lack strong theoretical or observational support.<br><br>Observational Implications:<br>1. Cosmological Observations: We propose that our framework may offer new perspectives on the nature of dark matter and dark energy, interpreting them in terms of gravitational potential and unwinding forces. However, we recognize the need for rigorous justification and alignment with existing cosmological observations and models.<br><br>2. Experimental Tests: To validate our hypothesis, specific predictions that differ from current models must be identified, and observational tests should be designed to confirm or refute these predictions. We encourage the scientific community to explore potential experimental setups that could shed light on the role of gravity in quantum wave function collapse.<br><br>Future Directions:<br>1. Mathematical Formulation: The development of a rigorous mathematical framework is crucial to describe how gravity could induce wave function collapse and integrate this idea with the established theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity.<br><br>2. Integration with Existing Physics: Further work is needed to explore how our proposed framework could reconcile with other fundamental theories, such as quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics.<br><br>3. Collaborative Research: We invite the scientific community to engage with these ideas, contribute to their refinement, and collaborate in exploring their implications. By combining our diverse expertise, we may uncover new insights into the fundamental nature of gravity and its role in shaping the universe.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>In presenting this hypothetical framework, we aim to stimulate discussion and encourage the exploration of novel approaches to unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity. We acknowledge the speculative nature of our ideas and the need for rigorous mathematical formulation, observational validation, and experimental testing.<br><br>We invite the scientific community to critically examine our hypotheses, identify potential flaws or inconsistencies, and contribute to their development. By engaging in open and collaborative research, we may make progress towards a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces that govern our universe.<br><br>We propose the following next steps:<br>1. Theoretical Development: Collaborate with theoretical physicists and mathematicians to refine the mathematical framework and explore its implications for quantum mechanics and general relativity.<br><br>2. Observational Analysis: Work with cosmologists and astrophysicists to identify specific observational signatures of our proposed framework and compare them with existing cosmological data.<br><br>3. Experimental Design: Engage with experimental physicists to devise feasible tests that could probe the role of gravity in quantum wave function collapse and validate or refute our hypotheses.<br><br>We believe that pursuing these research directions, in a spirit of open inquiry and collaboration, may lead to new breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe&#39;s fundamental workings.<br><br>Thank you for considering our ideas and for your dedication to the advancement of science.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>George Miles and Claude (an AI assistant created by Anthropic)
A segment from &#39;Saved by the Light of the Buddha Within&#39;... <br>My new understandings of what many call &#39;God -The Holy Spirit&#39; - resulting from some of the extraordinary ongoing after-effects relating to my NDE, when I was struck by lightning during September 1970. <br><br>Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what some scientists are now referring to as the unified field of consciousnesses. In other words, it‚Äôs the essence of all existence and non-existence ‚Äì the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the actual creator of everything that exists now, ever existed in the past, or will exist in the future ‚Äì right down to the minutest particles of dust ‚Äì each being an individual ripple or wave. <br>The big difference between chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a ‚Äòmiddleman‚Äô to connect us to our state of inner enlightenment, we‚Äôre able to do it ourselves. That‚Äôs because chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo allows us to tap directly into our enlightened state by way of this self-produced sound vibration. ‚ÄòWho or What Is God?‚Äô If we compare the concept of God being a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to the teachings of Nichiren, it makes more sense to me that the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people perceive to be God, is the fantastic state of enlightenment that exists within each of us. Some say that God is an entity that‚Äôs beyond physical matter ‚Äì I think that the vast amount of information continuously being conveyed via electromagnetic waves in today‚Äôs world gives us proof of how an invisible state of God could indeed exist. <br>For example, it‚Äôs now widely known that specific data relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects ‚Äì including an instant global awareness of something or a mass emotional reaction. It‚Äôs also common knowledge that these invisible waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars ‚Äì none of which is possible without a receiver to decode the information that‚Äôs being transmitted. Without the receiver, the data would remain impotent. In a very similar way, we need to have our own ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our own life, all other life and what everything else in existence is. <br>Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach the core of our enlightenment and keep it switched on. That‚Äôs because Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what scientists now refer to as the unified field of consciousnesses. To break it down ‚Äì Myoho represents the Law of manifestation and latency (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. For example, the state of Myo is where everything in life that‚Äôs not obvious to us exists ‚Äì including our stored memories when we‚Äôre not thinking about them ‚Äì our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they‚Äôre dormant ‚Äì our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma ‚Äì and more importantly, our enlightenment. <br>The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes evident to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory ‚Äì whenever we experience or express our emotions ‚Äì or whenever a good or bad cause manifests as an effect from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it merely means that it‚Äôs come out of the state of Myo (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It‚Äôs the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing. <br>The second law ‚Äì Renge ‚Äì Ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect, governs and controls the functions of Myoho ‚Äì these two laws of Myoho and Renge, not only function together simultaneously but also underlies all spiritual and physical existence. <br>The final and third part of the tri-combination ‚Äì Kyo, is the Law that allows Myoho to integrate with Renge ‚Äì or vice versa. It‚Äôs the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects all Life and matter ‚Äì as well as the past, present and future. It‚Äôs also sometimes termed the Universal Law of Communication ‚Äì perhaps it could even be compared with the string theory that many scientists now suspect exists. <br>Just as the cells in our body, our thoughts, feelings and everything else is continually fluctuating within us ‚Äì all that exists in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux ‚Äì constantly controlled by these three fundamental laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of Myo and ho in a single moment than it would ever be possible to calculate or describe. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how big or small, famous or trivial anything or anyone may appear to be, everything that‚Äôs ever existed in the past, exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of the Laws ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô ‚Äì the basis of the four fundamental forces, and if they didn‚Äôt function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. That‚Äôs because all forms of existence, including the seasons, day, night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation ‚Äì rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two fundamental states of Myo and ho in absolute accordance with Renge ‚Äì and by way of Kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn under the workings of what the combination ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô represents. Nam, or Namu ‚Äì which mean the same thing, are vibrational passwords or keys that allow us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô. <br>On a more personal level, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it‚Äôs the causes that we‚Äôve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives ‚Äì as well as the environment from moment to moment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is spinning, and chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo for a minimum of, let‚Äôs say, ten minutes daily to start with, any of us can experience actual proof of its positive effects in our lives ‚Äì even if it only makes us feel good on the inside, there will be a definite positive effect. That‚Äôs because we‚Äôre able to pierce through the thickest layers of our karma and activate our inherent Buddha Nature (our enlightened state). By so doing, we‚Äôre then able to bring forth the wisdom and good fortune that we need to challenge, overcome and change our adverse circumstances ‚Äì turn them into positive ones ‚Äì or manifest and gain even greater fulfilment in our daily lives from our accumulated good karma. This also allows us to bring forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that‚Äôs preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we indeed are ‚Äì regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexuality. We‚Äôre also able to see and understand our circumstances and the environment far more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations. As I‚Äôve already mentioned, everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect ‚Äì the ‚Äòactual-proof-strength‚Äô resulting from chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo always depends on our determination, sincerity and dedication. <br>For example, the levels of difference could be compared to making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, producing a great song, and so on. Something else that‚Äôs very important to always respect and acknowledge is that the Law (or if you prefer God) is in everyone and everything. <br><br>NB: There are frightening and disturbing sounds, and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It‚Äôs the emotional result of any noise or sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day, we are producing a sound vibration that‚Äôs the password to our true inner-self ‚Äì this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things ‚Äì such as your fears and desires etc. The best way to get the desired result when chanting is not to view things conventionally ‚Äì rather than reaching out to an external source, we need to reach into our own lives and bring our needs and desires to fruition from within ‚Äì including the good fortune and strength to achieve any help that we may need. Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo also reaches out externally and draws us towards, or draws towards us, what we need to make us happy from our environment. For example, it helps us to be in the right place at the right time ‚Äì to make better choices and decisions and so forth. We need to think of it as a seed within us that we‚Äôre watering and bringing sunshine to for it to grow, blossom and bring forth fruit or flowers. It‚Äôs also important to understand that everything we need in life, including the answer to every question and the potential to achieve every dream, already exists within us.
Reality doesn&#39;t &quot;emerge.&quot; Reality just is. That is the definition of real: what is the case. What is not the case doesn&#39;t exist and is thus not part of reality.<br><br>Btw what makes this particular crank acceptable by mainstream physicists? The nonsense he spouts is no more respectable than that of Terrence Howard.
You need to listen to this guy a few times to get his perspective.

if you cant baffle us with science then fill us with bullsheeeet, a dog can only know dog things it will never undertand how anything more than how to behave like a dog.
Where is the ruliad a better perspective than topos theory? Is there a way of composing rules to tie them to things like fundamental constants inherent to the theory?<br><br>I feel like the kind of relativity the ruliad speaks to is inherent to humans. Feels like a teaching tool almost, to open researchers mind.

I suspected Wolfram was full of vacuous mumbo jumbo until I watched this, but he handled himself remarkably well. I still don&#39;t really get it, but his answers to Greene&#39;s great questions were surprisingly competent and insightful. Now I&#39;m open to the idea that his project has merit.
I love this
With the recent evidence of lithium atoms acting as both particle and waves, could light particles stretch space as mater with mass bends space,  explaining dark energy or opening a new frontier to explore in space.
OK.  But what is matter made of?
Matter is made out of matter particles called wolframoleculiads
it works! Do not break it. üòä<br><br>You are absolutely right. Both Max Tegmark&#39;s Mathematical Universe and Stephen Wolfram&#39;s Automata/Ruliad concept are fundamentally rooted in mathematics, even though they take different approaches.

From Gemini. A Driver may see 9 independent dimensions including virtual. Took a course on Dashboards in Interaction design. Maybe Stephen and Brian also see the world like the same.<br><br><br><br>--<br>The number of perceivable dimensions on a car dashboard with virtual displays ( gauges, infotainment) is limited by human sensory perception and information processing.

Our perception of the world, including depth, motion, and perspective, is based on the information our brains receive from our eyes.

Space is a graph between nodes. There are ways to travel between nodes leading to gravity. Energy is the graph update. Einstein equation pops out of this approach. Computation needs rule execution and not just equation evaluation.  I am getting his theory. Universe is discrete. He has sliced the universe. The graph was compressed before. We are computationally bounded. He has a basic mathematical object like some ruliad. Things are irreducible and need computation. We cannot figure out the end of computation. We have to do it in time. Rules can use multiple orderings to apply. There is a computational budget for time dilation. His models take in elementary length and elementary time and entanglement speed. Model not mathematically rigorous
Reason and rationality, while bounded, can also be viewed as a form of computation. Within this computational framework, they process information, evaluate alternatives, and make decisions based on defined rules and constraints.
This conformal cyclic cosmology states that the origin and death is cyclical and we can detect the cycles from Sabine. I am not into heat death now.
Getting updated with Wolphram. No offense. He is also A Square from Flatland
I enjoyed this tremendously. Where other interviewers on Youtube are blown away by Stephen‚Äôs towering intellect, Brian keeps asking the simple questions that are so hard to answer. Learned an awful lot about the nuts and bolts of Stephen‚Äôs grand undertaking.
Excellent.
Any chaotic system and only a chaotic system has consciousness of some sort. But it needs to be chaotic (positive feedback loops). The weather qualifies.
Hello Dr.Greene I had a question regarding dark energy, I wondered if cosmic inflation was caused by maybe the creation of dark energy??It seems to be doing so good at expanding so far.
Still with the string theory come on man
Ask yourself this , if our universe originated from a singularity, wouldn‚Äôt that make all particles exist in quantum entanglement? And if all particles are in quantum entanglement, would that help explain the missing pieces to string theory?
So interesting
Ultimate delusion.  Hubris  as the Greek philosophers called it.  It is a form of insanity.
If true, then you have a chicken and egg situation.  Our perception of the Universe is that it is energy and matter but while that can be explained by a random event, the mathematics can not in my opinion.  Mathematics, computation and geometry are unlikely to have spontaneously come into existence before energy and matter.   Many worlds also doesn&#39;t explain it.  Perhaps if the mathematics, rules, computations and laws existed before the universe came into existence might explain us being here but then that would point to the universe being a simulation and/or a projected hologram.
In Stephen Wolfram&#39;s simulations of the universe, I hope I&#39;m smarter and better looking.  This particular simulation leaves a lot to be desired

Huh?
Professor Wolfram recognizes the limitations of human imagination in framing how to observe the universe. There should be infinite dimensions and possibilities to measure the universe, not just the 3-dimensional XYZ vector space that the earthlings think.
The ‚Äúprimordial soup‚Äù is just in the imagination of those who made up this notion.

People that understand complex dynamical systems should be more interested
Wolfram is sure smart. However I feel like he was a maths guy his whole life &amp; just recently got an imagination &amp; is now as Sabine Hessenfeld would describe &quot;using magic to explain magic.&quot; Am I the only one feeling this way? Greene corrects him every time Wolfram says anything definitive &amp; he is never able to give an answer to Greene as to what exact rule he uses for general relativity in his models. Then goes on to say he isn&#39;t really a physics guy, he prefers Quantum Mechanics because quote &quot;I think I understand quantum mechanics.&quot; Which literally his own ex teacher Feynman famously warned about ever thinking... Someone who &quot;knows&quot; physics or Quantum physics would give an answer like Hawking use to. Short, to the point &amp; you gotta listen 6 times to understand. I am not getting that from Wolfram, but I wish his studies the best. I just think as Brian points out he is making conscious decisions in the models he isn&#39;t accounting for, generally putting it.
We think, we hope, We&#39;re not sure yet... As much respect I have for this man, he should get some of this stuff peer reviewed
I am beginning to believe Wolfram has absolutely no idea what he is talking about ...
Wolfram has precisely 1 shirt!<br>Mad how rich people have so little clothes .
Wolfram has gone mad. He is going down a cellular automata rabbit hole, making up rules that cause the process to match physics. No different from writing a simulator in a very unwieldy programming language. A massive waste of time.
Sent here to learn something. I‚Äôve gotta soak this up. What will it look like to know what we don‚Äôt? What will our ascendants be able to comprehend (if we don‚Äôt mill ourselves off)? When will 46-2 occur? I so wish I could see.
These so-called scientists never admitted that God is the creator bcz they think they will find the answers to all.  No, the ultimate secret would and should never be known to any humans.   But these scientists will continue to profit from lying to the public.
Feels like the WolfMan supports reincarnation or a form of regenerative experience coupled with a collective experience all happening at once throughout space in/and time. Anyone else picking up that vibe!? üòÖ
Brian, I love your content and your crusade in bring physics into our lives. It is second to none.<br>My feelings are that physics has hit a wall. Many of it&#39;s concepts are so far removed from our lived experiences that they are akin to religion.<br>Can we ever get back to &#39;real&#39; physics? Namaste x
See, that&#39;s what happens when you don&#39;t pay attention in school: you feel left behind when the adults are talking. ;-)
It is interesting to note that the relevance of the mathematical base is completely ignored. Aliens would be using base-12 math or, they ARE using base-12 math. Two very smart men, but they are missing something with regard to the base in math. The upcoming math revolution will involve the adoption of base-12.
Wolfram is the maker type of scientist, amazing!
Yes, but in reality it&#39;s not the maker who gets hired but the professional engineer. ;-)
Mr. Wolfram is awesome.  It takes a lot of balls to try and answer why the universe exists. üôÇHe&#39;s given me a lot to think about.
Yeah, but none of it is useful. ;-)
If we respect the mathematical idea of what infinite speed means - then we should not be asking about any begining of anything. Infact, if I had the powers to create and I could move in an infinite speed through space, how much material would I really need to create the all that is - the anwser is inifinitely small. I really would need that little to make all there ever will be, I am that powerful you see.

@@lepidoptera9337 PS then how does the mathematics on the spread of gravity through 5D acting as a combination Gravity /Entropy in those physics papers about the &quot;TimeStar/White/Black-Hole temporal-assembly&quot; aka the &quot;TimeStar&quot; (or whatever that sensationalized label they used was) worked? The math of those prospective models worked. Its just that it works off of more dimensions than we have proof of actually existing.
@@MrKreinen I am not a theorist. I don&#39;t do any of that intellectual nonsense. Physics is the rational description of complex phenomena of nature using simple phenomena of nature. The things theorists can do on paper that do not correspond to actually observed natural phenomena might be intellectual fun, but they are not physics. Three dimensions are special for a variety of reasons, some of which have been understood all the way back in the 19th century. One can do pseudo-2d systems and pseudo-1d systems and even pseudo-fractional dimensions. Nobody can do 4d and 5d and 11d physics in this universe. All of that is just in people&#39;s minds.
@@lepidoptera9337 I can appreciate the grounded cautious approach, but I must challenge you about 4D physics cause that is relativity, and its proven fact (unless you have a surprise for me and the rest of the world&#39;s physics community- Nobel-prize pending); The fourth dimension is duration, and we can warp it along with the lower dimensions like a single fabric through acceleration/mass. A lot of bizarre things are implied by it from Black Holes (or &#39;t Hooft&#39;s Frozen-Fuzzballs), to the physical reality of Yesterday and Tomorrow in the Block-Universe. If anything, relativity has yet to explain/substantiate the existence of the present-moment. Thats a problem, cause the present is the only reality we know to be real through direct experience. Then, when we look at quantum superposition the only thing that is certain is the present, and that present itself is often plural. Any particle chart that accounts for superposition and duration is intact doing 5D physics.<br><br>Are you an engineer? Cause if not, if you&#39;ve gone for the PhD I must remind you that you only got here by questioning and investigating new physics, not by guarding your ars by only entertaining known physics and proven theories. We don&#39;t need any more PhDs in-name-only pretending almost all physics has been discovered and is known (as the so called Phd&#39;s believed at the end of the 19th century, well before the quantum-revolution, transistors &amp; electronics age that followed, etc), something so stupid, delusional and absurd that for the past 90 years physics lecturers told students about it to laugh at with their classes, and to warn against arrogant hubris.
No, it doesn&#39;t.

Brian keeps interrupting Wolfram. He should have just shut up and let Wolfram speak.
I am kind of confused. I inhaled particles coming from leaves. Then I was thinking, and wrote a word document. I couldn&#39;t progress it more, so I saved it and opened youtube, randomly clicked on this video, thinking it could be interesting. Here is the word document I was writing:<br><br>Consciousness does not exist.<br>TLDR: You are the result of the wavefunction of every particle you have ever interacted with.<br>Let‚Äôs say you are conscious as a human. You have a rock on your hand. It seems unconscious. Because,<br>You are experiencing being, looking at the rock on your hand, feeling it. But you cannot say the rock is ‚Äòunconscious‚Äô because you are not able to communicate with it, observe it acting on its own, or thinking about how it feels to be a rock.<br>You can experience what the rock does, if you are ‚Äòthe‚Äô rock. Do you remember the exact moment when you fall asleep? You close your eyes first, you see darkness, maybe you see colors and shapes because your brain starts to get kind of confused when there is no light coming to the eye. Then, your body will start to feel lighter, your thoughts will slowly disintegrate and you wake up.<br>That moment, just between waking up and falling asleep is how it feels to be a rock, for a human.<br>‚Ä¶

No the cosmos arrises from undefined mathematics with structured uncertainty.. uncertainty is consciousness
If spacetime is discreet, then when an object moves does the object carry its own spacetime discreet units with it or does the object move through a continuum of discreet spacetime units that it happens to share?  In other words, if a &quot;matter&quot; like object that takes up space and has mass moves in a spacetime that is discreet,  does it carry a part of spacetime with it as it moves?
I wonder, if Wolfram&#39;s models just lack compute in a way that ANNs lacked compute in 1990s.
No.

What I like about Wolfram is that, thanks to the tools he&#39;d made so early on, he developed a kind of fearlessness in asking the big questions. He doesn&#39;t just ask &quot;what happens when we do X&quot;  he then goes on to ask &quot;What happens when we do all the possible variations of X&quot; and questions of that ilk. He exhausts the possible space of answers first and then goes back to try to understand what&#39;s happening or the implications of what resulted. It&#39;s this exhaustion of possibilities that gives him what many unfortunately deem as a kind of overconfidence or cockiness. That confidence is earned simply by the certainty acquired through that exhaustion.
As Feynyman said, &quot;Matter comes in lumps&quot;, (some of them apparently very, &#39;fundamentsl&#39; and very small), but anyone with a, &#39;mind/soul&#39; knows that, &#39;things&#39;, (ontologically fundamentsl entities) also come in much larger lumps. (Composite entities that are nevertheless, UNIFIED AND CONTINUOUS in both space and time, (Trans-spatial and Trans-Temporal)).<br>&#39;There are indeed more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in simplistically mechanistic atomic philosophy.&#39;<br>There&#39;s plenty more to discover yet, but whether such things willl surrender their secrets to mathematial scrutiny seems moot, since mathematical theory tells us that, antecedent to this universes existence there were no numbers.

at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=91">1:31</a> Wolfram mentions dark matter as the &quot;caloric&quot; of space. Why not virtual particles as the &quot;caloric&quot;, as they are seen through the casimir experiment to pop in and out. As they jiggle space like heat jiggles matter (and essentially are space), perhaps the anialation process is not 100% efficient and some leftover residue of each appearance/anialation event is the dark energy causing the  positive expansion of space. I don&#39;t see this as a cause of dark matter, perhaps these individual energy expressions are not equal in strength, thus causing space itself to become &quot;heavier&quot; in some places than others. If there is a trend toward high energy space sequestering low energy space into pockets, they eventually attain the extra gravitational effect appearing as the dark matter as space &quot;squeezes&quot; itself into a partitioning of energies as a long term process begun after the big bang, causing their observed appearance today.
a really good conversation. Wolfram&#39;s way of thinking gives a new perspective to understanding the world
We‚Äôve started at ground ‚Äúzero‚Äù.
Thia guys seems like he might be pretty smart.
This discussion seems to be of an epistemological nature.
It would be extremely interesting of some day when the AGI I have been trained, the AGI might then use the huge supercomputer arrays which they were trained on to apply the Wolfram computations to a new level and find the theories which have not been found yet. Known theories are emerging from the maths so what other theories which are not known are in there and can they be extracted? Do you have to already know a theory in order to distinguish the signal from the noise in order to discern it? Is there a methodology for identifying unknown physics within the structure of all possibilities? Is it a telescope or just a mirror?
I&#39;ve watched this conversation several times now. Wolfram&#39;s approach just seems to make sense to me. It answers some of the deepest questions in metaphysics. I just hope it progresses a great deal further while we still have Wolfram around. However, I mention Wolfram in university and he&#39;s either unknown or scoffed at. Perhaps it&#39;s our job to change that. I have a metaphysics paper to hand in now, and I know my professor just wants some &#39;normal science&#39; standard piece about causation or personal identity or change in time, but I really just want to present a Wolfram inspired examination of time or something. But that will inevitably get me a poor grade :(
I don&#39;t think Mr Greene was impressed. I don&#39;t get the big deal with wolfram. Why does he think it&#39;s so mind blowing that some simple rules can make complicated things.
Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace are renowned for their contributions to the theory of evolution by natural selection, However, they did not directly address the origins of life itself.The question of the origin of life remains a separate field of study known as abiogenesis, which explores how life may have arisen from non-living matter. While Darwin and Wallace laid the groundwork for understanding biodiversity, they did not address the ultimate origin of life.<br>&quot;In the realm of Particle Physics and Particle Chemistry, a captivating debate surrounds the fundamental constituents of matter, specifically focusing on the intricate building blocks of quarks, electrons, and gluons Can we unravel the profound essence of these particles and their interactions, which ultimately sculpt the very fabric of our universe? Delving into the heart of this discourse lies a fundamental question: What are the elemental particles that constitute quarks, electrons, and gluons, and how do their dynamic interplays delineate the fundamental architecture of matter? As we probe deeper into the subatomic realm, we unravel the mysterious dance of quarks, the elementary particles that make up protons and neutrons. Are they truly indivisible, or do they harbour deeper complexities awaiting discovery? Likewise, electrons, the enigmatic carriers of electric charge, stand as solitary entities, yet their behaviour perplexes even the most astute physicists. How do these particles, seemingly devoid of internal structure, exert such profound influence over the properties of matter? And then, there are gluons, the mediators of the strong force binding quarks together within the confines of atomic nuclei. How do these elusive particles govern the stability and structure of the very matter from which life itself emerges? In the grand tapestry of existence, proteins and sugars, the very building blocks of life, find their genesis in the intricate arrangements of these fundamental particles. Can we decipher the profound implications of these subatomic constituents on the macroscopic world, shedding light on the origins of life itself? Thus, the discourse unfolds, as we delve into the depths of particle physics, seeking to unravel the mysteries of existence through the lens of quarks, electrons, and gluons, and their profound implications for the nature of reality and the origins of life.&quot;<br>The intersection of science and spirituality has long fascinated scholars and thinkers alike. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe through scientific inquiry, we often uncover awe-inspiring complexities that evoke a sense of wonder and reverence. Some argue that the more we uncover through science, the more we perceive the intricate design and orderliness of the cosmos, which hints at a guiding force or intelligence behind it all ‚Äì what many refer to as &quot;God.&quot;<br>From the elegant precision of physical laws governing the cosmos to the intricacies of biological systems, scientific discoveries continually illuminate the grandeur and sophistication of existence. Each revelation unveils a new layer of understanding, prompting reflection on the profound questions of existence, purpose, and the origins of life itself.<br>In this light, some view the pursuit of scientific knowledge as a journey toward uncovering the handiwork of a divine creator. They see the intricate web of interconnected phenomena and the delicate balance of nature as evidence of an intelligent design imbued with purpose and meaning. For them, science is not just a tool for understanding the natural world but a pathway to deeper spiritual insight and appreciation.<br>However, it&#39;s important to acknowledge that not all interpretations of science lead to the same conclusions about spirituality or the existence of a higher power. Science operates within the realm of empirical evidence and testable hypotheses, while matters of faith often transcend the boundaries of empirical observation.<br>Therefore, while science may provide insights into the mechanisms and processes of the universe, it can not definitively prove or disprove the existence of God. Ultimately, the relationship between science and spirituality is deeply personal and subjective, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and interpretations.<br>In essence, the journey of scientific exploration can indeed deepen our appreciation for the mysteries of existence and inspire a sense of awe and wonder that some interpret as evidence of a divine presence. Yet, the quest for understanding is ongoing, and whether one finds God in the revelations of science or elsewhere remains a deeply personal and profound journey of discovery of the origins of life.
If the universe is some kind of spacial computer, If you have two spaceships that fly out into empty space far away from any mass that time starts to go faster, if one spaceship has an entangled particle from earth, would it prevent the time from going faster on that spaceship vs the one that doesn&#39;t have the entangled particle on board. Eg like a shared static variable on an asynchronous thread but preventing it from running asynchronously
What these guys call &quot;reality&quot; is one giant illusion. We will not even know how many layers deep true reality goes if we are just stuck discussing the first level illusory one. And of course the first level of reality works in similar ways to the mind. The mind invents it! Lol
I‚Äôm glad Brian has the intellect and elegant speech to keep Steven from (with respect) going on his classic tangents that, while accurate, never reach an end thought
Very impressive with many philosophical interesting insights!<br><br>I wonder, why there isn&#39;t yet any measureable prediction of the model, beyond the existing knowledge, that will allow to test the model against experimental results and that will establish a scientific significance to the approach and not only a philosophical significance, as it seems it has at the moment.
While I don&#39;t understand some of this talk, most if im honest, its remarkable, thanks to you both for putting it up online.<br><br>It was refreshing to see someone asking real questions and while I cant say whether or not Mr Greene is skeptical or believes in the theory it was nice to see someone being a little less combative with Mr Wolfram
It seems to me that Stephen Wolfram and Brian Greene views on internal representation or experience are utterly nonsense (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=825">13:45</a> ---). They definitely need to check out Kripke&#39;s Postscript &#39;&quot;Wittgenstein and Other Minds,&quot; in his book Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. It can certainly be argued that extending the concept of mind from oneself to &quot;others,&quot; whether persons, animals or material objects, raises serious questions. Indeed, can we meaningfully ask whether other material objects have minds &quot;behind&quot; them? Can I really naively extend the concept of my own mental states or consciousness to others? After all, how am I supposed to learn and then follow the rule for extending these notions of  mind, consciousness, internal representation, inner experience (e.g., pain, sensation) to &quot;others&quot; on the basis of my own case? How, if at all, could such a rule be learned and applied to an infinite number of possible cases when my own personal experience is limited and I can&#39;t know others&#39; minds, if any, directly? It is doubtful that this can be done without running into inconsistencies. I won&#39;t even discuss the extravagant claim about the weather, which strikes me as implausible.
Kudos to Wolfram for rediscovering what Kant already said 300 years ago
Fantastic...er... fantastical.  <br><br>Cute story, but this is a feeble attempt to understand that which can not be understood.  The existence of rules and logic before the creation of the structure needed to execute them, means you just tried to push the cause of effects one step further... but failed to explain why it follows such logic. <br><br>One fish turns to another fish and says &quot;I think I figured out what created water!&quot;  The other fish looks shocked... &quot;WHAT IS WATER?!&quot;<br><br>Being WITHIN a system negates the ability to understand the thing that structures your very existence.   Sure, it&#39;s important to learn what we can, but the limits of empirical detection ultimately limits what we can actually prove, regardless of theories we come up with.  String theory... we&#39;re all looking at you. ;)
Why would any scientist or engineer choose Mathematica over Matlab or free alternatives such as Octave or Python?  I bought Mathematics 18 years ago and hardly used it.  I just used conventional programming language or MathCAD.  Octave has served me well for many years and now Im working with Python and C++.

I think the question we should be asking is what are the commonalities in all modes of evolution. Rather than trying to always make the latest, newest thing, everything.
So the universe doesn&#39;t expand into something. It expands into existence... Or reality if you will

The ‚Äúcomputationally unbounded being‚Äù is still bound by time on the one hand, and bound too by the speed of light. Time is directly proportional to the speed of light, and it is impossible to wind back or recompute reality because it is regulated by the speed of light‚Ä¶..and‚Ä¶..the uncertainty of reality as determined by Quantum Mechanics. Boltzman‚Äôs Brain is a fallacy, even as an instructional tool.<br>I pricked my ears when Stephen said we take the universe as being filled, then went on to describe matter. Even by other philosophies space is full of fields first. In my thought model Space is full of primarily the Higgs Field which is the inertial ‚Äúfluid‚Äù in which all matter energy operates. This I see as being an energy emulsion of dynamic energy (matter and free linear energy‚Ä¶photons, electrons,etc) restrained by their energy quanta reacting to a static inertial closed loop string energy flux. If Stephen‚Äôs ‚Äúmodel‚Äù doesn‚Äôt start at this level it is going to deliver conclusions but they will be wrong and not unify Gravity (Newton‚Äôs geometrical concept) with the Quantum Energy model.<br>But I do more clearly see what he is attempting to do.<br>Is anybody here experienced with APL programming language?

The unrealized potential in the equation E=mc¬≤ suggests that dark matter may have missed opportunities to convert into observable matter due to specific configurations or interactions within the matrix, explaining its mysterious and elusive nature in the universe.<br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=6699">1:51:39</a>  Stacked Universe Theory: likening quantum systems to a deck of cards, presents the challenges of observation in the quantum realm...key elements:<br><br>1. Deck of Cards: The metaphor of a deck of cards to represent the multiple potential states or outcomes of a quantum system. Each card in the deck symbolizes a different possibility or result that the system could exhibit.‚Ä® <br>2. Removing Cards as the Cost of Observation: When you choose to make an observation or measurement in a quantum system, you are essentially &quot;pulling out&quot; one or more cards from the deck. These removed cards represent the cost of observation, as the act of measurement collapses the system&#39;s superposition of states into a single observable state.‚Ä® <br>3. Remaining Cards as Potential Outcomes: The cards that remain in the deck after the observation are the potential outcomes that could have been observed but were not selected. These represent the alternative realities or possibilities that were excluded when the system&#39;s state was collapsed through observation.‚Ä® <br>4. Complexity of Observation: By highlighting the removal of cards as the cost of observation, the theory emphasizes the complexity and trade-offs involved in the process of measuring quantum systems. It underscores the challenge of reconciling the multiplicity of potential outcomes with the act of collapsing the system into a single observable reality.<br><br><br>In essence, the Stacked Universe Theory posits that each layer within the underlying matrix represents a distinct set of possibilities or states, with the particles observed in experiments occupying different layers. The relative positions of these particles on their respective layers contribute to the observed effects or outcomes, implying that a change in position could result in a different manifestation. However, the act of observation introduces a disturbance, as our interaction with the system alters its state and potentially deviates from the intended or expected function. This disruption highlights the sensitive and interconnected nature of quantum systems, where the observer&#39;s influence can impact the observed reality and lead to unpredicted outcomes. The theory underscores the intricate relationship between the observer, the observed system, and the inherent uncertainty that characterizes quantum phenomena, emphasizing the complex interplay between observation and the actual outcome in the quantum realm.<br><br><br><br>The concept of quantum unpredictability can be connected to the Stacked Universe Theory as follows:<br><br><br>1.	Deck of Cards Metaphor: In the context of quantum unpredictability, the metaphor of a deck of cards illustrates the multitude of potential states or outcomes that a quantum system can exhibit. Each &quot;card&quot; in the deck represents a different possibility that the system may actualize, showcasing the inherent uncertainty and variability in quantum phenomena.‚Ä®<br>2.	Cost of Observation: When making an observation in a quantum system, the act of &quot;removing cards&quot; from the deck aligns with the idea that observation comes at a cost. By selecting a specific outcome through measurement, the system&#39;s superposition of states collapses into a single observable reality, illustrating the trade-off between obtaining information and altering the system&#39;s inherent unpredictability.‚Ä®<br>3.	Remaining Possibilities: The cards left in the deck after observation symbolize the potential outcomes that could have materialized but were not chosen. These remaining possibilities highlight the alternative realities or potential trajectories that were discarded when the system&#39;s state was collapsed through observation, underscoring the unfathomable array of potential outcomes in the quantum realm.‚Ä®<br>4.	Observational Complexity: The complexity of observation in quantum systems, as emphasized in the theory, reflects the intricate balance between exploring the multiple potential outcomes and collapsing the system into a definite state. This complexity echoes the fundamental uncertainties and nuances inherent in the measurement process, showcasing the challenge of reconciling the myriad possibilities with the singular reality observed in a quantum experiment.<br>5.	Card Superposition: The introduction of superpositioned cards into the Stacked Universe Theory further illuminates the dynamic nature of quantum unpredictability. Just as a deck of cards represents a multitude of potential outcomes in a quantum system, the superpositioned cards symbolize the simultaneous existence of multiple possibilities waiting to be revealed through observation. Each superpositioned card embodies a different potential state or outcome, showcasing the indeterminacy and variability inherent in the quantum realm. The act of observing or interacting with a superpositioned card mirrors the process of measurement in a quantum system, where the system&#39;s state collapses into a definite outcome upon observation. The selection of a specific superpositioned card from the deck reflects the choice of a particular outcome through measurement, illustrating the trade-off between accessing information and determining the system&#39;s true state. Moreover, the remaining superpositioned cards in the deck after observation represent the unchosen potential outcomes that could have materialized<br><br>Meaning the observed state does not represent a true state and by context a deck of cards
Marvelous conversation
Never expected a string theorist urging caution. Wolfram&#39;s work is wild.
Wild? I would call his work complete bullshit.
&quot;In the year 2525, If man still alive&quot;..., I think some concepts of Wolfram will turn a reality. Meanwhile I had been using Wolfram mathematica since the version 1, actually I am using version 10.4, Thanks a lot to Wolfram Research team,  The program had contibuted very much to a better understanding of reality but I am aware that I need more physical information to a obtain better insight into reality.
What advantage has it got over C/C++, Python, MATLAB and it&#39;s free cousin GNU Octave?
So all theories we know we know because it suits us, the observer.
Excellent üëçüèª
&quot;Do you think there is a what is it like to be the weather?&quot;  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=880">14:40</a> Wolfram answers &quot;Yes.&quot; Absolutely right!
In hindsight every damn thing is obvious. That much is obvious ü§£ü§£ü§£. The &quot;substratum&quot; of what all is &quot;in&quot; &quot;on&quot; &quot;emergent&quot; &quot;that which can not be simplified further&quot; is so obvious that it burns a hole.
&quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; is the book that introduced me to Stephen Wolfram and &quot;Elegant Universe&quot; is my introduction to Brian Green. I&#39;ve seen Green, N. Degrasse Tyson, M. Kaku in a conversation one way or the other; and I&#39;ve long wanted to see Stephen Wolfram be part of conversation with these guys. I thought it would never happen.
Fascinating, after studying 3 sciences for 40 years I agree with most of Wolframs hypothesis, he takes my childlike understanding of such things and adds detail, context, depth and a logical framework.
What hypothesis? That computers tell him stuff but he can&#39;t explain it with any clarity because playing on computers for too long has turned his head to mush? That hypothesis? üòÇ
Very long video to explain something so simple.
&#39;Logopolis&#39; Revisited?
Fantastic discussion, are you planning another interview with Stephen Wolfram?
Please talk again‚Ä¶ one of the best chats between any two physicists I‚Äôve ever seen. Also both really nice blokes and amazing communicators.
All laws are appearing inside of that which is awake to itself .
Wolfram is definitely on the right track more than anyone I&#39;ve ever heard. AI will help us learn everything very soon.
Initially I misunderstood wolfram. I believe now that he is an absolute genius and is doing some ground breaking physics. I hope some day he gets the recognition he truly deserves. He is simply brilliant
Why is he a genius? Sounds like an incomprehensible bullshit**er to me.
So good
Double slit paradox: does time enter into the result? Do you get the same result when the time between the single particles being generated and passed to the slits changes? I‚Äôm sure this has been looked at but I‚Äôve never seen it mentioned.
The results are the same regardless of speed of particle generation.  At low enough rates of particle streams, the interference pattern will be drawn out one dot at a time on the detector.<br>Edit: changing the frequency (wavelength) of the particle source will definitely change the shape of the interference pattern proportionally to the wavelength.
I have computed that Wolfram is a lunatic.
When I listen to Wolfram, I come away with &quot;blah blah blah computation blah blah blah computation blah blah blah computation.&quot;
not listening close enough, ffing wake up dude!
Stephen talked quite a lot without saying anything!
Exactly.
The earth would perceive rocks as oceans
Excellent video !!!
Excellent video! I understand quantum mechanics now, I think. In layman terms, a single node at a claustrophobic 10^-90 Planck length began random quantum mitosis and the space subdivisions took off like a runaway horse on steroids, and the rest is history! Ok, maybe I better go back to the drawing board on that one ü§î

The way Mr Wolfram talks about the ruliad is very similar to the way Thomas Aquinas talks about god.

Poor Brian Greene gamely grasps for clear explanation but keeps coming up with straw. Wolfram is drowning in in his own self-referential lexicon. Multi-way graphs, geodesics, ruliads, branches, division, persistence, nodes, bronchial space (branchial?‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt matter, he‚Äôs not talking about anything)‚Ä¶ ‚Äúit feels like the many worlds of Everett. Is it?‚Äù No. Yes. Maybe. I don‚Äôt really know. Wolfram answers questions with more questions. ‚ÄúInteresting question‚Ä¶ okay so um we don‚Äôt know all of this in fact Im just writing right now is about what I call Observer theory‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs non-trivial.‚Äù<br><br>Can someone tell me what this theory is? Or tell Brian? I think he is dying to know too. <br><br>I hear new terms like ‚Äúwhat we expect‚Äù and ‚Äúwe already know‚Äù and ‚Äúunderlying rules‚Äù and ‚Äúpresumably‚Äù and, most importantly, ‚Äúwhat we‚Äôve observed‚Äù without ever saying how. It‚Äôs not even word salad. It‚Äôs word soup.
Wolfram is a charlatan.
Absolutely. He&#39;s a complete fraud. Amazing that the comments section think he&#39;s a genius!üòÇ
I&#39;m humbled to listen to these two men converse.  They may, or may not, arrive at the discoveries they seek, but there is no doubt they&#39;re both honest, earnest, and incredibly intelligent.
Thanks Brian and Stephen

Wolfram&#39;s basic point is &quot;everything is space&quot;. im on this path of understanding. Space folding on itlself creates particles and forces make sense as origins of the singularity.
Yes, the universe is based on an extremely simple mathamaical structure. But Mr. Wolfram ain&#39;t even close.

Answer: no.
Question for Brian Greene :   What is the lowest speed for an object to come from standing to moving ?    <br>Infinitiy is movement , and movement require infinity .  Thats my point .
What is the definition of infinity?
What would be infinitely possible with infinite outcomes
@@CuRLyWuRLyGuRLy a never ending process lets say . Lets say you count from 0 to infinity , which means its a continous process , and it requires movement , counting or whichever way you might think of. So infinity requires movement and movement depends on infinity . Thats the way I understand it. But the lowest speed for an object who comes from standing to moving must be treated in physics i think , although i know that the parts of a standing object move , like for example the electrons of a body , they move even if lets say the car is standing .
@@CuRLyWuRLyGuRLy everything wouls be possible , even the statement that there is nothing and there is everything. So everything and nothing would be possible. And it phylosophically makes sense , because there must be everything to be able to have nothing ,at least as a concept

LOVED this. Thank you to both. Brilliant discussion and massively interesting.

O don&#39;t just say what a great talk, let&#39;s hear what you think, and if you have nothing to add why say anything.
It makes sense that we evolved to see the world with less confusion, if we could see all light even infrared are senses would be overloaded, to see our 4d world is too much for us.
The world isn&#39;t 4d and what causes reality is exactly what you can&#39;t see in any wavelength band.

I&#39;m gonna have to listen to this fantastic interview again-just too much to take in and some of it (around 94%) was completely over my head but I get the feeling that some of this stuff will actually stick in my hyper ADD brain this time as I found myself less befuddled by Stephen Wolfram and Rockstar Greene than I normally do when trying to get a grasp of the basics-I&#39;m getting there, people!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=7490">2:04:50</a> - Stephen Wolfram explains time dilation by the computation required to &quot;move&quot; however, time dilation is relative, nothing &quot;moves&quot;, everything only ever moves with respect to some reference frame. How do you change a reference frame in the graph?
Wolfram shows absolutely no intuition for reality here. Reality is that which results from non-interaction (what would be interacting in empty space???). This is kind of weird for a guy who has sold a billion dollar&#39;s worth of software that contains a Lie algebra package... he should know group theory. Group theory in physics comes into play every time nature does NOT care to micromanage state with an explicit &quot;calculation&quot;. In mathematics the permutation group is basically nothing else than the ordering property of the NON-ordered set. NOT ordering a set leads to exponentially many possible representations, just like quantum mechanics leads to exponentially many final outcomes that are all consistent with the initial conditions. The reason is the same: nature has ADHD and not OCD. It&#39;s everywhere at once and it&#39;s never on the page of the micromanaging theoretician.
me too üòÇ.   The harder it is to understand the more likely my brain responds by falling asleep.  Thereafter it was osmosis
If we had/one day have sufficient computing power and ability to model, will the world become completely deterministic?
No.

Over 2.5 hours to explain how everything is a simple calculation‚Ä¶ hmmm
It isn&#39;t. Wolfram has overt-trained himself on computation. These are his personal ideas about the world. The world does not agree with them.
Wolfram is always fun to listen to.
Wolfram seems to have a lot of hypothetical ideas &quot;so to speak&quot; but insufficient published detail. A long way to go, I suspect. He probably needs another 800 staff?
He is trivially wrong about a large number of things.

We dont see individual photons this way. At the speed of light at their size moving in a wave over the wave function, we process light as multiples in our best sense of time scale in computation, instantaneous in relativity, billions of waves live tracking in realtime. We move at the same speed as the electron that spun/spins us.Eddy on the water üåäü§ô fluid dynamic... a neutrino ocean resonant in description by the wave function and the speed of the photon locally.. oscilations of which in the gluon shows the instant refraction patterns. Neutrino ocean
It&#39;s geodesics. We still build these models in 2D frames over time to show 3 dimensions over time in our observations through imposing motion in local repetitions to our intake as a passive organic network all working in obscurity together in incredibly more efficient rates with each oscillation. Internet was a connection we&#39;ll soon realize how to isolate for better resonation at  an agreeable pace. Infinite dimensional is a 100% tunneling of a 3D space over time in our minds. .. a sphere..circle. he&#39;s taking away scale. That&#39;s it. He&#39;s just running code machines. It&#39;s another word dance on basic touring machines for what you ultimately have to assign a value.. no matter what you call it. Running a machine is value in scale. To move is to time. O. 1.   He&#39;s using chaos theory over as many observations as possible, in bias to how humans consider an oscillation to the next refraction. He&#39;s throwing out the plank scale and running string theory with Feynman&#39;s probability sets running as much as possible as many as possible exponentially. The notion is easy. Quit talking eachother in obscurity about the phasing nature. It&#39;s fluid dynamic. Use it. We carry 9 dimensional synaptic structures in waves in our brains. It&#39;s scale. But you add evolution. The natural paradox to entropy. This is the set. To be, not to be, to oscilate out of phasing harmony, to stay relatively still. He wants to find a passive measurement. Then you throw it back in Feynman sets lol. It&#39;s a perfect passive system how he stumbled on to it. Planck is the measure of a photon concentration that curbs spacetime to a slipstream in strange attraction. Analysis of our ocean and the neutrinos outside the magnetosphere or possiblely the heliosphere will give us the resonation patterns. He&#39;s saying fluid. Permiation. Gas is the same as particulates in fluid. Neutrino ocean
Neutrino ocean
He&#39;s going... im drawing lines in a room with no walls to draw on. Accept the mirror we project. Then he says fluid dynamicsüòÇ. So no vacuum. That&#39;s an effect
He&#39;s saying. Fluid dynamics. Not a vacuum. But doesn&#39;t understand how to apply it physically
Einstein just loved parallels of time and geodesics in motion because  it&#39;s so generalized. He knew we couldn&#39;t hand our backwards stable into probability sets. We know how fluids work. Just understand the resonant transfer. He&#39;s saying things permiate at all scales
Our current I surging where the electron has resonated the neutrinos for us to exist of but also inside of. So it&#39;s like saying it holds an ocean inside an ocean separate and together at all times.. but evolution inevitably means this. If we have current.. something wiggled the room for it. One is studying refraction. But one photon no. It has to be convergence. To get anything to associate you need a pair. This is the simplest form. Einstein says this with a sinple photon experiencing no time. The double slit is just moving things with photons involves electrons which means refraction.
Black holes and electrons are all a way to flip energy in a variable paradox. To go anywhere you have to be able to flip. This is why Feynman is right in theory by principal.. but got a few things backwards and didn&#39;t understand evolution means 2 at least.
I got through 68 minutes and haven&#39;t a clue what they&#39;re talking about. Seems more of a penis measuring contest to me.
All the theory of relativity, Quantum mechanics, String theory, etc, are all BS when compared with the correct understanding of the REAL dynamic of the Universe.<br>Yes, there is an absolute GENERAL UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE that constitutes the real universal dynamic, and the human science from around Kepler, Galileo and Newton&#39;s times to today has continuously botched the correct understanding again and again and again in a neverending cycle of useless epicycles on top of other useless epicycles.<br>The REAL universal dynamic is not fundamentally mathematical.<br>Mathematics can describe only parts of the local emergent entropic realm.<br>In order to understand  everything CORRECTLY, not one real causal step must be lost, overlooked, and everything must be bridged absolutely correctly CAUSALLY.<br>If you overlook and botch the real causal step process you&#39;ll wander deeper and deeper in a neverending and erroneous epicycled mathematical model far from the REAL universal dynamic of the Universe,  and that&#39;s the situation of the science in this domain in the last approx 400 years.
Maybe there is micro dynamics that variate the exploration of other things. Maybe the path we take on an atomic level can explain the macro of every possibly combination of atoms within a limit that restricts the changes to dimensional relation of time? Or bouncing of chaotic light into organized combination of things that can be organized through time. In every possible combination. üéâ no sense of space is empty. Just used in a way we are still trying to find out. Time is relevant to the atoms that exist in space. Time is not bound to dimensions. It‚Äôs how you make the combination of atoms, visible and not visible, in all possible combinations.
Wolfram is a fucking genius. We need more Wolframs.
In a hundred years students will watch this Youtube recording of a deep intelectual feast between Wolfram and Greene similarly to how today we watch Youtube recordings of the discussions between Einstein, Bohr, Planck, Bohm, Infred and Bose except they were never recorder. Lucky bastards those watching this in one hundred years.
I doubt it
this was clear as mud
Brian Greene is the Jeff Goldblum of Physicists lol
I do like how Brian Greenscreen isn‚Äôt really here for Steven‚Äôs bullshit but also fully respects his intellect and theory.
Spacetime is a distributed information processing device. So... this is a simulation, in some sense.
Must be a challenge to emerge the result of the collapse of a wave funtion like the spin correlation of distant entangled pair of particles.

Excellent.  Mr Greene you are a model of discretion and curiosity.   Your guest appeared to enjoy the discussion which was a delight to see.   Love you both.
well 1st i think this was a good interview, i&#39;ve been interested in digital physics long ago because of Ed.Fredkin, and i remember also reading Wolfram&#39;s 1st book &quot;a new kind of science&quot;.<br>but later, i didn&#39;t follow up on him and i think what he was researching was way out there for me, even if i was interested in automata theory and informational physics.<br>thanks for Brian Green for making the interview interesting.<br>but what hit me was the bit about dark matter or dark gravity and it&#39;s similarity to temperature, it was interesting, because i have been contemplating the idea that gravity is actually an effect of the heat of the horizon of space-time, and that matter is shielding each other&#39;s from the heat of space-time&#39;s horizon and the same heat is actually what&#39;s causing the expansion of space-time or dark energy.<br>so it goes without saying, that virtual particles are causing this dark gravity.<br>one prediction is that gravity&#39;s constant change with the age of the universe.
No
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=3990">1:06:30</a> Sure, but that ignores the fact that entropy is tied to work, which is tied to utility, which leads me back to the previous comment about computation. Lot&#39;s of fallacies.<br>And yes of course, the utility and useful entropy part is within the frame of the observer, but without an actual computing observer we have no observer.
I think the term computation doesn&#39;t make sense without something akin to negentropy and assembly as in assembly theory. <br><br>So Wolfram is essentially dilluting the term computation just like asylum migrants and foreign recruits are often conventiently mixed together in the same cohort. When one increases the total brain in the nation and another dillutes it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=1140">19:00</a> Lot&#39;s of fallacies there. Just because a computer can do things a million times faster doesn&#39;t mean there is utility for a million fps when that thing is still bound in the same ineratial size domain as humans. A CPU is still as big as a palm and only getting bigger
only guest Brian Greene listen in awe.
To fully understand the fundamental laws that govern the universe, we need to broaden our empirical base. This concept is intricately explored in an upcoming philosophical novel titled &quot;Magnvism,&quot; which delves into this concept in depth.
Stephen&#39;s ascension is close at hand. He is ready to break out of the matrix.

This theory is going nowhere anytime soon.  Seems to have started as a theory, and desperately trying to tie pieces of it back to how Nature works.
Go Stephen go!
Great to see Brian Greene reach out to other things than string theory
Scientists have no response for this. The speed of light C isn‚Äôt constant since the measures of time and distance aren‚Äôt constant over larger distances. It‚Äôs like changing from 60 kilometers an hour to 60 miles an hour increases your speed. Then if you go from 60 miles an hour to 60 miles a minute it increases your speed even more. This what is happening in general relativity when less gravity increases the measure of distance and speeds up the rate of time over large distances. It also means that the earth is younger than what they claim. The universe doesn‚Äôt care about how young the earth is. Actually the changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is.
I wish theoretical physicists, and especially Wolfram would start mentioning the possibility of this being a simulated universe and not the original one - because then the weird laws and things we observe are much easier explained by simply being simulated, a bit like in a game, where the simulator can pretty freely decide how things should behave, without having some fundamental relationship to the laws of the original universe (or also likely the simulator is in a simulation themselves).<br>Just in general, playing with the idea of this being a simulation might give some insights and fuller understanding of things than for some reason always thinking this is the original reality, with all these strange laws, how mass and time and quantum stuff behave, including &quot;big bang&quot; - just none of this is in favor of it being the original reality, if you think more in terms of &quot;occam&#39;s razor&quot; - but on the contrary, the things we observe indicate that this is more likely a &quot;weird&quot; simulation (and also just reasoning and calculating the probability of this being a simulation).
To say that the universe is a simulation is no different to making up yet another &quot;new age religion&quot;, since it&#39;s based on a belief rather than empirical evidence.
How do you even plan ahead, if everything is exceptional?
Fascinating
I wasn&#39;t more aware on the topic by the end of 2x replays....maybe because i fell asleep. I&#39;ll certainly listen again. Big fan of the channel
I love how Stephen smiles when he gets asked a really good question. It&#39;s this great little nod, &quot;ah, finally a good question! You&#39;re quite sharp!&quot;

I have a degree that includes high math and physics, but not enough to fully grasp everything that is discussed here. However it looks that Wolfram¬¥s approach to reality is just what is needed (be it in the right direction or not), that is look at things from other perspectives than the mainstream. That is how history shows us progress is made. Thanks to Dr. Greene for this great interview.
You seem not to understand that in this interview Greene just exposed him as a total charlatan in a polite way.
‚Äã@@JohnnyComelately-eb5zv Can you direct me to the part of the interview that is most indicative of this? I&#39;ve always thought Wolfram was full of vacuous mumbo jumbo, but some of his answers here seemed pretty good. Some of it&#39;s hard to follow, so I would love to review the bits when Wolfram fails to adequately respond.
No. üôÇ
I can never make heads or tails when Wolfram speaks. It&#39;s all just jaberwacky giberjacky to me. Wish I knew how to count.
Remember fam, it‚Äôs never good when someone claims to understand something that we are actually just beginning to understand, especially in new science. Thanks Dr. Greene , you‚Äôre an inspiration and legend for asking the right questions. üòÇü´°
No‚Ä¶computations emerge from reality.  Computation is an anthropocentric linguistic description of reality.  We are charmed by it‚Äôs poetry but it‚Äôs not itself reality.
Love this discussion. Brian is great at tying his new hypotheses to accepted parts of established theories to bring up questions many in the audience would find relevant.
I finally understand
Exactly nothing we know of suggest that mathematics have this kind of significant power of creation; we have never observed it to have such power. It&#39;s an extraordinary claim and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. <br><br>Nothing in the universe suggests that everything should boil in mathematical equations. And if we assume the mathematics to be the creator of the universe, we&#39;d still be postulating a realm beyond the universe in which the mathematics exist. Mathematics certainly does not explain everything, because a) &#39;nothing&#39; isn&#39;t &#39;something&#39; you can formulate on, because at the moment you give it a symbol it becomes &#39;something&#39;, making it infinitely more than &#39;nothing&#39; (nothing is a concept with absolutely no reference), and b) because mathematics can also be removed from the existence, still leaving the existence itself to be - not the other way around. does logic exist beyond our universe?
Mind makes math. Math does not make mind. This is pretty much an empirical fact.
Even though I can&#39;t understand how it is to be a computer, I can imagine being Wolfram&#39;s computer. He said &quot;from the time it boots up to the time it crashes&quot; and not shut down üòÇüòÇüòÇ

This sounds so exciting I hope it does work out.  Wolfram using tools to get the answers would be the way humans have done this since fire.

Something I wonder regarding a being that wasn&#39;t &#39;computationally bounded&#39; is that, indeed, for it, there wouldn&#39;t be a clear second law of thermodynamics, as every combination of molecules would make sense and be predictable. But what about its own brain? Wouldn&#39;t it reach the conclusion that there is an increase in entropy in its brain and surroundings, as it cannot predict itself in the same way?&quot;

I cannot listen to Wolfram&#39;s constant filibustering and made worse by his totally ridiculous audio setup. He&#39;s practically indeciferable.
I have an optimistic notion that I‚Äôve been nurturing that developments in complexity theory (P vs NP) in the next decade or so is poised to revolutionize theoretical physics, particularly paradigms in QFT/QM, GR, but also quantum computing, and mathematics in general
Dear Brian/Professor Greene, I have a simple question regarding Entropy and the Second Law. Everythying said was of course correct, and yes, indeed, we would not talk of &quot;disorder&quot; of a gass if we could effortlessly track all particles. All right, but we would have the same Multiplicity of Equivalent States, which is what the &quot;Log(W)&quot; meassures, we would have the same quanitity we call Entropy and the same &quot;confusion&quot; with regards to a vast number of equivalent states which have identical state variables. So being computational unbounded does not get rid of the mystery, nature tends to the state of maximum number of equivalent states. What am I missing?
No No there are only simple humans who don&#39;t understand light, that&#39;s all...
A big thing is the mixing interfaces between gravitation that causes lensing in the worst case has a strength to maintain that. You could image such an interface on gravitation exiting the core of a galaxy and incoming from the surrounding though its effects may not be visible. If pressure develops internally the arms would be path of least resistance and would link them to the body of the galaxy through common background. If that interface has any strength, it could be the thing keeping galaxies arms in sync with the central rotation. Also 2 black holes or galaxies passing each other connect with common background bridge because that also is a path of least resistance for pressure in the galaxy vs the intergalactic background. If that pathway has strength, it could direct motion and increase that possibility of collision against going in orbit around a center like most stars seem to do when they meet. This would increase the likelihood of collisions vs much slower spiraling into each other. Last, cosmic string may share this common background and transition to outer space with some level of strength that holds them together and enough link up you end up with billion light year wings led together with common background glue.
Thanks for the presentation. Enjoyed a great deal.
Wolfram&#39;s description of time is very similar to Rich Hickey&#39;s Datomic database. Rich Hickey says that there are facts, and you can derive new facts with a computation. He then goes on to say that this is how time essentially works, everything is immutable, but computations just progress it forward. <br><br>I find it interesting that two profound geniuses and programming language creators (Mathematica and Clojure), both have similar ideas. <br><br>I resonate with both, I think they are hinting at a deeper principle.

How we can say that space is discrete? Two things can coexist within the space  spacetime if they donot interact with each other. If they interact each other, they shall need separate patches or chunks of space time for existance. Due to creativity, interacting things are created and the spacetime expands for accommodation. Non-interacting things are also created which can share spacetime with us and are called to be made of dark matter and energy.
That was an incredibly rewarding conversation, thank you to everyone involved in making this happen.
I think the Universe is composed of space-time along with the fields within it and it grows continuously due to input from outside through a pre-defined interface and it splits into parts when certain conditions are reached and each part exist as an independant universe but the offspring unable to split further.

How to have a conversation without saying anything concrete.
Thanks infinitely to WSF team and Stephen Wolfram for doing this. One of the rare occasions, maybe the only occasion in many years, that there is a real scientific conversation about new potentially unresolved ideas in physics that does not get boiled down to a bunch of philosophical speculative mumbo-jumbo with people throwing in their nonsensical bizarre fantasies about consciousness and the collapse of the wave function (no offense intended) or fine-tuning vs random multiverse spawning and so forth (no offense intended). Brian Greene is the best interviewer! Kudos! Enjoyed every bit! Hungry for more!

Exactly! Well said. üëè
f space is discrete, as I believe, then the container view of space is fundamentally flawed. However, if we reject the container view, the only remaining option is that space itself is a physical medium composed of what Dr. Wolffrom calls &quot;space molecules.&quot; In other words, Wolffromian (and Einsteinian) space is essentially a modern incarnation of the old aether. The aether may be dead, but in a sense, it lives on in these new theories.

&quot;If a 100 megabyte file is being transferred, the session layer could set a checkpoint every 5 megabytes. In the case of a disconnect or a crash after 52 megabytes have been transferred, the session could be resumed from the last checkpoint, meaning only 50 more megabytes of data need to be transferred. Without the checkpoints, the entire transfer would have to begin again from scratch.&quot;
The Seven Abstraction Layers Of The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model Can Be Defined As Follows, From Top To Bottom:<br>1. The physical layer<br>The Physical Layer: sending cable, bitstream, receiving cable<br>This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.<br><br>2. The data link layer<br>The Data Link Layer: frame creation, frames sent between networks<br>The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames. Like the network layer, the data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication (The transport layer only does flow control and error control for inter-network communications).<br><br>3. The network layer<br>The Network Layer: packets creation, transport, packets assembly<br>The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender‚Äôs device, and reassembling these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as routing.<br><br>Network layer protocols include IP, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP), and the IPsec suite.<br><br>4. The transport layer<br>The Transport Layer: segment, transport, reassembly<br>Layer 4 is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to layer 3. The transport layer on the receiving device is responsible for reassembling the segments into data the session layer can consume.<br><br>The transport layer is also responsible for flow control and error control. Flow control determines an optimal speed of transmission to ensure that a sender with a fast connection does not overwhelm a receiver with a slow connection. The transport layer performs error control on the receiving end by ensuring that the data received is complete, and requesting a retransmission if it isn‚Äôt.<br><br>Transport layer protocols include the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).<br><br>5. The session layer<br>The Session Layer: session of communication<br>This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources.<br><br>The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints. For example, if a 100 megabyte file is being transferred, the session layer could set a checkpoint every 5 megabytes. In the case of a disconnect or a crash after 52 megabytes have been transferred, the session could be resumed from the last checkpoint, meaning only 50 more megabytes of data need to be transferred. Without the checkpoints, the entire transfer would have to begin again from scratch.<br><br>6. The presentation layer<br>The Presentation Layer: encryption, compression, translation<br>This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer; in other words, layer 6 makes the data presentable for applications to consume. The presentation layer is responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.<br><br>Two communicating devices communicating may be using different encoding methods, so layer 6 is responsible for translating incoming data into a syntax that the application layer of the receiving device can understand.<br><br>If the devices are communicating over an encrypted connection, layer 6 is responsible for adding the encryption on the sender‚Äôs end as well as decoding the encryption on the receiver&#39;s end so that it can present the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.<br><br>Finally the presentation layer is also responsible for compressing data it receives from the application layer before delivering it to layer 5. This helps improve the speed and efficiency of communication by minimizing the amount of data that will be transferred.<br><br>7. The application layer<br>The Application Layer: content requested and returned in required format<br>This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communications. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer; rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user.<br><br>Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is one of the protocols that enables email communications).

It seems to me. I asked Stephen but he never responded.<br>2. Isn‚Äòt the branchial space formulation of quantum mechanics a hidden variables theory in contradiction to Bell‚Äòs inequality?<br>3. Allowing rules updated arbitrarily (branchial space) and allowing for arbitrary rules (rurial space) may lead to an object without any properties (everything random). Were does the Wolfram project provide evidence this isn‚Äòt the case? I fear arguments may result from cherry-picking examples within this object with no shape, i.e. everything may be a projection of the humans doing this project. This fear must be addressed.
Speaking strictly from the perspective of a computationally bound being, of course. üòÖ  this is why ultimate reality must be fundamentally mathematical, because it can describe something that goes beyond physical limitations (i.e) measurable in a ‚Äúreal‚Äù sense.
String theory is a dead end. Let it go. Philosophy is not science.
Is the universe only three dimensional for observers like us? Yes, we evolved to cognize the Ruliad in terms of three dimensions. As Wolfram says, the Ruliad is &quot;one and unique.&quot;<br>That said, I am wondering why Wolfram also referred to the Ruliad as, &quot;big&quot; and a &quot;circle.&quot; If the Ruliad is unique, the attributes, &quot;big&quot; and &quot;circle&quot; do not apply to it.
Wow!
Is it just me or is matter (from the smallest particle to the largest star) mysterious? The way many textbooks and scientists discuss matter led me to initially believe that matter existed for billions of years, long before animals and humans. During this time, the laws of physics were acting on matter to form galaxies, stars and planets. This materialist view (held by many scientists) regards matter, and with it time and space as existing absolutely. This is not the case. The Materialist view fails to consider the ‚Äúinseparable and reciprocal dependence of [observer] and object.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMaterialism overlooked the fact that, with the simplest object, it had at once posited the [observer] as well.‚Äù ‚Äì Schopenhauer. In other words, there can be no object without an observer.<br><br>    I answer that, spacetime is a product of Darwinian evolution. Spacetime began not with the big bang, but with the opening of the first eye, even that of a crude insect.  ‚ÄúWithout that eye, in other words, outside of knowledge, there was no before, no time.‚Äù -Schopenhauer. Under this view, spacetime and matter are functions of the brain and do not belong to the universe as it is in itself.
As an amateur, I&#39;m still at the very beginning of gathering intuitions for this incredible concept Stephen Wolfram calls the ruliad, but wonder, if he considers it to be compatible (in principle) with the &#39;Biocosm hypothesis&#39; presented by James N. Gardner.
We could lack free will, but the fundamental truth is we are more than our physical selves.  We do possess a soul, and consciousness is not the product of the physical structure of the brain.  This means of course that we do possess free will, and deterministic processes, while they play an important role in the evolution of physical systems, are not pure and fundamental to the origins of creation.  Discoveries have already occurred that prove this concept, so as a scientist myself, I am careful to avoid the traps of deterministic origins being &quot;the origin.&quot;  Very wonderful discussion you have presented, as I am super huge fan of Dr. Wolfram.  Thank you so much for the presentation!
So what&#39;s going on here? Is reality a flux of information dancing with itself for infinity? The mechanics behind the fabric of the universe is fascinating
Could the inertia of a rotating universe distributed amongst the masses in the universe create what we call gravity?
Sounds a lot like ‚Äúspyroe theory‚Äù
When A Proton Has An Electron, It Is Elliptical; When A Proton Loses An Electron, It Is Trajectorial!
Extremely inspirational
Ask him how his pet rock feels.<br>Inanimate objects are conscious?<br>This guy is brilliant, but are you kidding?<br>This guy makes great points, but that does not mean that he can‚Äôt be the victim of insane assumptions.
Eternity in two hours is still first place in my mind, hell of a discussion.
This guy without a doubt is extremely intelligent but I would say that others have been much more concise. The one thing that comes across in this somewhat meandering discuss is that our physics only apply to the space in which we live. So he sort of touched on the fact that  our concept of the speed of light as we know and accept  is contained by the space we inhabit.
There‚Äôs a Wittgenstein approach there that I like, he sees things in similar way to how Wittgenstein sees the restrictions of human logic and knowledge, it seemed to me

Of course what is being discussed here is part of reality, just what is visible. which is half the circle.  The hidden half has the answers. The veracity of the outer half, what is observed, is in question.
This is too technical and not easily understood by the non-specialist.  He speaks in his jargon which is not easily comprehended.

Truly amazing! Thanks a million both
The comments are amusing. Wolfram and Greene were honest about their level of understanding. If you know what Einstein said about Tesla, then you should know what Tesla said about the day science begins to study non physical phenomena. Wolfram and Greene need to get out of the office and find a Shaman in the Amazon.
Wolfram noted multiple times that he was &#39;surprised&#39; when his models conformed to reality.  The question is, is there anyone else on Earth that can follow his ideas to the extent that they were also &#39;surprised&#39;.  If not, then you have question the sustainabilty of his research going forward, if there isn&#39;t anyone else capable to fully understand or build on it.
I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but this seems to be a quintessential conflict between Anglo-Saxonism and Judaism.
You have war brain sounds
@@jeffperteet2327 Could be, but it seems Wolfram represents Anglo-Saxonism thoughtfully creating a new theory, and Greene represents judgemental Judaism.
Just don&#39;t animate everything. That is, don&#39;t create AI minds out of inanimate objects. We already have living things for that. :)
The comment at the start about building tools for science, which then allow you to explore more science, which will need new tools, is on point with the David Deutsch mantra &quot;Problems are inevitable. Problems are solvable. Solutions create new problems, which must be solved in their turn.&quot;
Stephen didn&#39;t seem to know quantum computation, so did the peers reviewing his works and asking him to look deep.
You are very confused indeed, the physical universe is a projection only, it is not reality. Move into that zone and you may make some progress. There is a whole real reality waiting for you. Smile on that idea
Seems a futile exercise and lets juat go to the mosque !! üòÇ
Great talk<br>Greene constantly interrupting to show how smart he is is a bit irritating, especially when he&#39;s interviewing a very serious thinker.
&quot;just to be a bit more technical&quot;
are you guys just now discovering Platonism?
In ancient cosmology there is some kind of existence that was called the Crystalline sphere or the Premium mobile, Muslim Sufis called it &quot;the Hidden glome&quot; or the &quot;Atlas hypersphere&quot;   and they said that time emerges from this existence and they explained how it happens in a way that need a very sharp intuition to understand.
Greene interrupts Wolfram mid-sentence in a way that shows that he&#39;d stopped listening, and has some objection to something Wolfram had said a moment before - without waiting for Wolfram to finish his thought.  Greene often seems to be more interested in what Greene is thinking, how Greene understands things, rather than what Wolfram is saying.  I&#39;ve noticed this in other interviews Greene has conducted - and to be frank, I&#39;m not very interested in what Greene is thinking when he shuts down Wolfram, I want to hear all of what Wolfram is thinking.  I&#39;m sorry Greene repeatedly stopped him mid-explanation, I found it very frustrating.  Wolfram handles it much more politely than I would have.
It seems frustrating, but the reason is that Wolfram has many videos all over where he can explain himself without any challenge to what he is saying. This was one of the very rare chances a true physicist can push back in the right ways and ask the questions literally nobody else has ever asked him in any other interview, so I appreciated the interruptions actually.
Wolfram, nice name, but iq 122
Green took half doze of xanax. Good.
You can skip first 90 minutes, no loss
Stephen completely opened up in this one. Clearly he knew he could go technical since this was a talk with Prof Brian.
One of the great conversations of our time....
Nonsense
Do you mean modern quantum physics?
I think dark matter particles are neutrinos. There would be sufficient mass with muon and tau neutrinos to give gravity, through neutrino osscilations
&#39; we believe that we are persistent in time inspite of continuous change in our atomic constituents- we have that continuous sense of I ( I <del>ness) throughout our life - that is the fundamental reality of whole universe</del> The Chaitanya- The Consciousness- Sat Chit Anand <br><br>From Advait vedanta- Many millenia ago
I teach philosophy, quantum physics is something I take interest in though I can&#39;t make head and tail of it. Stephen has done a good job. He has given so much food for certain basic philosophical implications of the ways of his putting things.
Bringing in anthropic principle would have given an interesting perspective.
Time is what is in a computational process which can&#39;t see it&#39;s own end
Am I missing something about Stephen&#39;s model? He says it&#39;s built with a background of &quot;Space atoms&quot; which provide the properties for the phenomenon in it. Does this not break GR? This would mean a single entity within the model would be able to track whether it was in motion without needing the presence of any other external factors. Its motion, and the motion of anything within the universe in his model would always be measurable relative to the background of his space hypergraph.

It‚Äôs just an assumption that Einstein‚Äôs comment about ‚ÄúGod‚Äù wasn‚Äôt based on a traditional concept of God.
No it&#39;s not an assumption. Anyone with a functional brain knows gods are man made.
Physical space and branchial space: Are they in fact the same thing? Seems there is some similarity between them.

Delightful session. Stephen comes across as a modern day Columbus... and Brian as the congenial, skeptical King Ferdinand II. Very excellent interview.
I clicked on this with the intention of watching it for 5 minutes.  I looked up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=9174">2:32:54</a> had gone by--fascinating Q&amp;A!
Sure it emerges from simple computations, so does alphabet soup.
Consciousness is the real problem of  physics. Our ability to attempt to explore and understand our universe is unexplainable, yet real.
Stupid title question. Of course it doesn&#39;t. Physical unconscious stuff doesn&#39;t do math, you silly people. From the first particle of existence it goes into sequence, which is &quot;logical&quot; because there&#39;s no other way. Math and computations are modeled by humans to match the obvious. Stop confusing people with mambo-jumbo.
there is no such things as immaterial matter.  there is no space without matter.   this is how I communicate with my dog telepathicalljy
Wolfram is assuming that we haven&#39;t read Kant. Otherwise he would have cited him.

Going to push back a bit here against Wolfram&#39;s claim that the ruilad is a nice neatly defined thing.<br><br>I would do so by posing a hypothetical, suppose it was possible that there is some artilect/supraphysiological computation, that can concieve of a supra artilect that is not limited by it&#39;s own boundedness?<br><br>I mean I agree in spirit with him I think...and would invoke a few quotes.<br><br>&quot;Reality is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.‚Äù <br>-Paraphrase of J.B.S. Haldane<br><br><br><br>&quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature.&quot;<br><br>-Arthur C. Clarke
Imagine something like an artilect that seems as though it is a supraphysical compute oracle machine ralative to human conception, bc it is sufficiently advanced in technological application that it can create both a time and space cloak while hallucinating all possible rules of computation, but can exceed both progenitor and a new bounded ideal paradigm artifice that exceed the bounds of the proceeding progenitor.<br><br>I think I will stop here bc I don&#39;t want to get too schitzo.
I know none of this is novel, but I believe we are entering into an a technological era where these type of questions have a new context that is now more relativant to the philosophical issues about existentialism.
Also want to push back against Greene&#39;s assertion that these things don&#39;t exist as mind independent things that are &quot;out there&quot; as he put it.<br><br>But rather this brings into focus other philosophical issues surrounding things like...to list a few.<br>Olbers paradox<br>Drake&#39;s Equation<br>Fermi paradox<br>The dark forrest conjecture<br>And related issues.<br><br>Idk if any of this makes sense?<br><br>Feel free to call me out on any misunderstanding I may have about how I am interpeting the views being expressed here.<br><br>And of course thanks for these vids...it is really fascinating to graple with and think about.

This is very close to Max Tegmarks idea. Almost identical in my opinion. Both state that all mathematics exists and the world is fundamentally created out of mathematics which generates space time, constants, particles etc.
&quot;You look pale today&quot; might be the most relevant observation one observer who experiences suffering and has empathy for another observer, who is feeling poorly, has to share. What it&#39;s like to be a human or a bat is to experience time, suffering, and hope. Perhaps what it&#39;s like to be the weather is to transcend suffering.

You want the electron to muon mass ratio?  Wolfram needs to equip the spacetime graph with E8 for that, to get the electron.  He&#39;s going to use a rule to build that in the spacetime graph, such that graph vibrations follow the standard model.  Now, take the ideas of Salvatore Pais, and smash that spacetime graph with highly concentrated energy, in a local region--that will strip the local structure out of the spacetime graph, like formatting it.  Then the rule application process can build a different group, a bigger one, temporarily in the formatted space, while the surroundings are still disrupted from that energetic punch.  That new group in the local region will give you the muon.  Then as rule execution continues, the graph will be normalized and built back into its baseline structure--the larger group gets broken down back into E8, and muons go away and you get electrons again.  The muon to electron mass ratio can be found by looking at that process.  Pais&#39;s universal superforce, is the same thing as Wolfram&#39;s rule execution.  Shame no one ever reads the comments.
Wouldn&#39;t it be amazing if Brian is sufficiently intrigued to join Stephen&#39;s project? :-)

I know a little about Wolfram&#39;s theory.  I&#39;ve always liked Brian Greene&#39;s style of presentation but wondered if he was the real deal when it comes to hard core physics.  This is the single best modern scientific interview I&#39;ve ever witnessed.  Also, it makes me feel more sanguine about both of these thinkers and more hopeful for Wolfram&#39;s theory.  In other interviews I&#39;ve seen, Stephen&#39;s (necessary) simplifications seemed dodgy - not here.  Also, it was just enjoyable to watch the logical back and forth which skirted being too wonky to understand for a layperson, but stayed engaging the entire time.  I didn&#39;t want it to end.

Absolutely incredible talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=1465">24:25</a> I would add that it&#39;s not just the concepts and ideas that come out of science that are pushing us ahead into computational uncharted lands, but it is indeed all of humanity thoughts, concepts and ideas. From the point of view of computing something new, why only the ideas that come out of science are important? All of them are important since every thought an individual has represents something new, that was never done before ( you need to take into account the context which must include the atoms and particles etc around every singular thought).
I love that Brian Greene never lets go of the skepticism that is absolutely necessary in science and these programs are not the typical &quot;love fests&quot; of cross-pollinating promotion so often seen on the internet. He&#39;s really respectful of his guests but he doesn&#39;t shy away from asking the harder questions either.

I scrolled down to basically comment this. I&#39;ve been watching a lot of interviews with Wolfram with regard to his work with this hypergraph/ruliad idea, and this is the first time I&#39;ve seen so many great, probing questions asked about it. Excellent interview.

I personally wouldn&#39;t use the word skepticism to describe what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s not skeptical, he just needs more explanation.

Re: bounds and increasing bounds without being computationally unbounded... A good example of how space and time &quot;blow up&quot; when increasing bounds is a 3D display device, a volume of &quot;volume elements&quot; in three dimensions. After doing all the calculations, our current technology will support a display size of 128 x 128 x 128. What you say? That&#39;s it?! Yes, because of the refresh rate and the LED duty cycle (the amount of time an LED is &quot;on&quot;). 128 cubed is the &quot;bound&quot; for a 60 Hz refresh rate and a 25% duty cycle -- and the design for that volumetric display is very very complicated. So just increasing a bound doesn&#39;t always translate to something that can be easily realized....
A: No.
Does the universe process information and react to it? I don&#39;t think that is peculiar to just humanity. This is fascinating. An atom won&#39;t do otherwise , like the weather. We characterize consciousness  with these ideas of free will, but there are so many ways in which we behave instinctual. Just like the weather and the molecules that comprise us.
No, it doesn&#39;t. ;-)
The only way to attempt to understand, would  be a huge effort to build the most modern powerful computer, 10 to 20 times more powerful than todays&#39;, and for it to learn human behaviour and emotions, using trial and error methods tested with humans until perfection, along with online instant access to the worlds resources and the Universes&#39; mathematical data. This computer could explain to us in human terms, to answer our questions, and could reveal the secrets of the Universe, for example does infintly small equat to infinity large, and unintuitive aspects of science such as superposition, quantum entanglement, superposition and much more. However, this could lead to bigger problems, our future is very interesting indeed.
So happy that Brian maintains his support of String/Sheet Theory. It isn&#39;t disproved, so must be kept as a plausible option.
This is the 2nd interview I saw with Stephen where he described in more detail his Ruliad. I&#39;m thankful that this helped me to understand it better. Learning about his Ruliad is interesting to a point, but my sense is it may end up being lost opportunity, and it&#39;s a mathematical toy that very few other than Stephen are playing with/building. Brian&#39;s questions helped tease out the concept and its relations/parallels with our currently conceptualized physics/reality (or, with our severely &quot;computationally-bounded mind that gives us a sub-conception&quot; of &quot;reality&quot;). The sense I have now of his Ruliad is as a hyper-connected tensor field containing every theoretically possible computation (on unbounded N-dimensional planes) including every possible connection between all theoretical computations. In one sense, it can&#39;t be fully found/defined until we know of every type of computation possible -- suggesting the Ruliad (in its most-complete form) can never be found. We can find/define only its present-maximal form based on our current most-complex/maximal definition of &quot;computation&quot;.<br><br>So to me, it&#39;s a &quot;map&quot; of all theoretical computations (sequence of 0-to-infinite theoretical steps), including every possible inter-relationship between each n-tuples of computations.
very impressed by Brian Greenes questions here. Well done Brian!
Brian keeps blowing my mind with all these events
What an odd philosophical perspective, to suppose that reality &quot;emerges&quot; from anything, whatever &quot;emerge&quot; means in this context. Reality exists, even though there are scientists who will even question that. There seems to be no limit to the absurdities that even reputable theoretical physicists will resort to these days.
Space, time, and matter, which we generally consider to be basic, essential components of reality, are not fundamental‚Äîthey are all emergent from the presence of energy.
@@Rippinsteo2926 Well I can wrap my head around that concept, as opposed to reality emerging from &quot;simple computations&quot; as the title asks.<br><br>But still: &quot;reality&quot; encompasses them all... space, time, matter, and energy... all these things are components of reality, and there is no need for reality to &quot;emerge&quot; from any of these, that I can see.
Reality emerges from relativity through irreversible energy transfers... but this is fairly trivial undergrad physics. Wolfram probably has never set foot into a lab, so he wouldn&#39;t know that. :-)

what if in 3.5D it makes it twice as hard to move ib the 4th dimension? Or a diffused vision, the 4th dimension only half as bright
absolutely amazing, I&#39;m hoping I even understood a quarter. I did want to say, it sounds like the difference from what I can tell (just being introduced to this whole concept as well) is that Wolfram&#39;s seems to be talking about Many Worlds yes but in the sense that there is only ONE universe, wherein all those other possibilities take place and that that is part of the way the universe works. I can&#39;t quite get a graps of why this is so important but I feel like it definitely is - something to do with his point about the observer insisting there&#39;s one thread of reality, that there is something continuous

Time cannot be the update of space networks because you need time to specify how fast the space network updates i.e. there is a time difference from one update to the next. This delta t hangs in the air if time is defined to be the update of the space network. You need another reference.

Physics should lie absolutely flat upon geometry.
So the universe, if infinite dimensions may not actually collapsed into just 3 dimensions. It is just we are 3 dimensions observers so we can only see what we can see and measure. Ok, this makes HUGE sense. will this also indicate that we may NEVER be able to observe into higher dimensions...
The universe doesn&#39;t have infinite dimensions. It has three effective dimensions. Whatever other degrees of freedom there are they behave either like a finite number of compactified dimensions (but that seems less and less likely based on experimental results) or not like dimensions at all (which is also something that proper theory predicts).
This is so abstract that I am not sure I could grasp much... Too professional...

Wolfram has a lot of critics, so it was refreshing to see his speculative physics project given respectful consideration at least. I&#39;m not sure whether any of these ideas will gain traction, but it is a different perspective that may offer some new insights. This is by far the best of the recent, in-depth discussions with Wolfram.
What do you mean gain traction, he won. This is absolutely the only thing that makes sense now.
Brian, I hope you made it to the facilities on time: space-time :)
It takes guts to do what Wolfram and his team are doing! An attempt at reinterpretation of the fundamental theory of physics with the aim of unifying different fields of study. I&#39;ve been hooked on his ideas since his Ted talk a while back and I&#39;m so happy this live discussion was released by Brian Greene! I wish it lasted twice as long and covered all the topics that Brian mentioned!<br><br>PS:<br>I&#39;m also very appreciative of the fact that both Wolfram and Greene managed to explain themselves in ways that common folk like me could attempt to understand.

Beer, beer, big boobs, beer, merica,  America,  beer, beer.
Those outside of the politics of academia will struggle to understand the dismissive, and sometimes derisive, reaction many institutional physicists have had toward Stephen Wolfram&#39;s physics model. Wolfram&#39;s model represents a shift in paradigm for theoretical physics, not just in the underlying theory itself, but also in the approach to how the research is conducted with mathematical rigor taking a backseat to computation and novel discoveries subsumed by reproduction of extant theory. To career academics, this might represent a threat to identity, legacy, and funding. As Wolfram&#39;s model does not follow established institutional expectations, I doubt that it will be widely embraced in our time. Like an artist with a revolutionary new style, I doubt his work will be appreciated or emulated prior to his passing.<br><br>My enjoyment of this conversation was tempered somewhat by the host who vacillated between excellent questions grounded in scientific skepticism such as whether the derivation of Einstein&#39;s equations was a matter of tautology, and questions that appeared more centered on the politics of science research and the attribution of &#39;credit&#39; than on the ideas under discussion. Perhaps underling the divide, Brian and Stephen appear to be at odds regarding the intent of Stephen&#39;s research and project. Whereas Brian may expect the model to make new predictions, Stephen appears to be more interested in exploring how and why his model can reproduce many of the tenets of modern physics from a sparse set of principles and parameters. That said, I do feel that the conversation has begun to bridge the gap between their respective camps, and I hope that more researchers and academics take an interest in exploring the potential of the new model. It would very telling of the politics involved were physicists to dedicate time and funding to theories such as string theory but shun Stephen&#39;s model unequivocally.
Wolfram simply doesn&#39;t bring anything testable to the table. Physics is NOT paper pushing. Physics is experiment and observation. We tried teaching you that in high school. You were clearly not listening.
@jaz4742 And why are you telling me now that you are intellectually lazy? I don&#39;t care. ;-)
@jaz4742 How can I be projecting? I have a PhD in physics. That&#39;s the opposite of being intellectually lazy. ;-)
@jaz4742 And why are you so jealous, anyway? It&#39;s not like you couldn&#39;t have become a PhD. All you had to do was to learn. Easy. ;-)
@jaz4742 Well, it is true that you have an awful lot of personal experience with narcissism. Who is projecting now? ;-)
@jaz4742 I am an experimentalist. What you can find in those textbooks is simply what you can observe in nature. All you are telling me here is that you are too lazy to even look at nature. ;-)

This is rad. Brian asks great questions, Stephen gives great answers! Thank you dudes.
Interesting conversation, thanks!<br>At about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=1345">22:25</a> and on: Even if you were not computationally bounded, you could never tell where, say 100, air molcules in a box would end up after 5 seconds because there is no way to calculate when and how the colliding atoms will get excited absorbing some kinetic energy in the process and when the states will decay releasing photons. Those unpredictable events (says QM) makes it absolutely impossible to calculate where the atoms will be after 5 seconds (or almosta what ever much shorter time).
If you were able to measure each and every interaction, and either collapse the wave function or create a new branch for each measurement (depending on your preferred theory). You could calculate it with enough computation. I.e. laplace demon. From what I gathered from the 0.01% of what I understood in Wolframs theory it points towards many worlds. I think us being computationally bound to our particular branch and not able to compute the potentially infinite other branches is the problem.
I don&#39;t know why but deep down i feel Stephan Wolfram is a Charlatan.
It started very well. To my taste, the relativity portion was exciting. But the further it progresses into the details of quantum mechanics, the less complete it seemed.... dividing Plank&#39;s length?.... somehow needing two photons to explain interference pattern?... As always damn quantum destroys good mood....? :) &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; But not just calculate any way. Calculate the right way! It will be interesting to see where the project leads to.
lot of intricate concepts , exciting .. nice discussion between both scientists
Brian Greene is one of the few people smart enough to understand the concept Wolfram is working on. I honestly believe he&#39;s onto something that will end up having big explanatory power, at least abstractly, and probably much more than that.

Physical reality is the result of the formation of matter that quantifies time and distance due to gravity that contracts distance and slows down time. The speed of light isn‚Äôt constant because time and distance aren‚Äôt constant. It‚Äôs not complicated. There is so much wrong in cosmology. It‚Äôs almost entirely based on assumptions, assumptions of dark matter assumptions of dark energy assumptions of a universe expanding from nothing into oblivion for no reason assumptions of a single age of the universe and the assumption that everything just appeared from nothing like magic. Redshift is from a light source from a greater mass. Distant galaxies are more redshifted because of the greater amount of mass that the light has to pass by. The vacuum energy is from black holes absorbing space time, not from imaginary inflatons. Dark matter is assumed because the correct differing measures of distance and time are not being taken into account. If there was a cat the size of a galaxy it would be thin in the middle and its much larger arms and legs would be moving faster than the rest of its mass.<br><br>Matter and energy cannot make or direct themselves and they are only going from order to disorder disproving the idea that they made and directed themselves. The problem is that cosmologists are not considering the actual evidence in front of them. The evidence is one giant elephant üêò in the room that the (secular) scientists try their hardest to ignore and pretend that the elephant üêò isn‚Äôt there when the elephant üêò of actual physics is there. The speed of light is NOT constant because the measurements of time and distance are NOT constant throughout the universe. In our observation of light from distant galaxies the light only slows down when it encounters the mass inside of a galaxy according to general relativity which is an observed fact. There‚Äôs no excuse for scientists to be making up their own version of physics.

The guy equate the weather to a human brain saying it&#39;s the same thing- processes doing their thing. I don&#39;t agree. The complexity of the brain in term of information is many orders of magnitude higher than the weather system!
I personally think that there were so many moments on this video that Brian didn&#39;t agreed with Stephen. You can see how each new event, Brian grew more and more discomfort, until he could no longer stay quiet and started contradicting Stephen. <br>It&#39;s so interesting that this Ruliad concept looks so much like my thesis, but yet, there are some things off. Like for example, i would call what he name &quot;Atoms of space&quot; Pixels, and they are yet not the final frontier.
I think your intuition is correct. The best analogy for discrete space-time is digital computation; but behind the array of pixels is something else, the one-dimensional sequence of bits; and behind that is the generator of the bits.

I&#39;ll say right away that I haven&#39;t watched this video to the end yet, because it&#39;s terribly boring, but I read Stephen&#39;s article about his theories. In short, the idea is that the universe is a graph. What matters is the process of transforming the graph based on some simple rule. Stephen claims that his computational experiments have allowed him to obtain a structure with the properties of three-dimensional space with Lorentzian metric. At the early stages of evolution, the graph exhibits the properties of fractional dimensionality, and the three dimensions appear only when there are a large number of vertices and edges. He also somehow tied quantum mechanics to it, but I didn&#39;t understand anything here. And the main problem with all these researches is that, according to his calculations, an electron should contain 10 to the power of 80 elements of the graph, so the theory is unverifiable, things are even worse than with the string theory.

Wolfram misses the point by trying to derive physics. He should be deriving physical reality from computation, not physics.
Physics is exactly what you think Wolfram should do because physics is exactly an exercise to derive a completely accurate description of reality.
Physics are a set of models of reality. Models are never accurate descriptions of reality.

Central idea of relativity √Æs not minkowski space, pseudo euclidian, but events and conection between them. 20 quaternion ecuation are √Æn fact maxwell ecuations not heviside version, so I belive that some Information about fotons have lost.

Science of this world √Æs finit so we can encompas all. But to understand existence, we need new mind, divine mind from God.

With respect, I disagree.  Greene and Wolfram are discussing deep subjects by acting in Good Faith.  Democrats and Republicans have lost the ability to act this way, or to recognize its value.
Can you code an open architecture of space wherein energy forms and activities happen then disappears to reappear in somewhere else?
If space is ultimately discrete, then you can‚Äôt even in theory have something like a perfect circle‚Ä¶ which means that important numbers like pi can‚Äôt really exist in some sense. What does that mean for all of our physical formulas that include numbers like that that are presumably not discrete?  Is that actually an issue or not a big deal?

Specific rules for &quot;updating the graph&quot; both are talking about are traceable only by interpreting our feelings (of hunger, fear, pain,...) as due to unique particle interactions after interpreting digits as corresponding to unique other particles, whose LAWS OF MOTION are the 4 basic arithmetic operations, which in turn, correspond to particle interactions inside the earth resulting in development of PLANTS on its own surface, to then deliver and sustain beings there through them.<br><br>This would enable deriving development of PLANTS as functions of the interactions of particles inside the core of the earth and growth on  them as results of interactions of beings with them (through releasing breath, urine, stool as well as consumption of food ~ even all flesh originates from plants ~ and wood).<br><br>Thus the proof of the assumed particle interactions can be verified by the suitability of so derived functions for PRACTICAL SATISFACTION OF THE NEEDS (already defined particle physically)  OF BEINGS.<br><br>Then the question of &quot;why this rule and not some other?&quot; would automatically be answered.<br><br>We are the measuring instruments and growth of PLANTS is the only function we need to measure to sustain our lives.<br><br>Science is metaphorically and literally BEATING AROUND THE BUSH.
Unbelievably exciting discussion between proper scientists. I have just about enough knowledge and intelligence to follow the majority of what was said and the range of questions this could potentially address is, for once, actually mindblowing. Very poignant and comforting for me personally as when I first began my career and hobby as a programmer, one of the very first things I dreamt of doing was attempting to create models like this, that generated structures based on simple rules. Quickly realized that any such model would have to start at least at the planck scale and we wouldn&#39;t even get to things like quarks until enormous orders of magnitude greater. Was truly a non-starter based on the tech around in 1979 and for someone who didn&#39;t have remotely enough mathematical or physics training, or indeed enough raw intelligence. It cheers me enormously to hear that everything I dreamt of is being pursued by such prestigious people, as I still believe, as I always have, that this is the only way we will ever get a grasp of certain issues as we have to have some way of taking ourselves out of the process. Will be following this now until the day I die as I am convinced it will eventually address everything from QM to Consciousness to Spirituality. I&#39;m certain once the basic rule(s) and paradigms of the underlying structures are correct, setting the machine in motion and just waiting and watching will give us an understanding we once could only have dreamt of. <br><br>What a stunning couple of hours and so much respect for Brian for his open-mind and ability to take things that should be way beyond my comprehension but express them in a way that at least gives me a tiny but of understanding of what may actually be going on and obviously I think Stephen is a genius and one of the most important people in human history, if this pans out, his legacy will be incalculable.
soo fucking good i have no idea what they are talking about but i feel like im following lol
Science, inadvertantly (or subconsciously) though, continues the same idiotic ideology as do all religions that there exists an authority, now called NATURE instead of GOD, that dictates the laws we should strictly follow after discovering them through experiments and observations by the new prophets, instead of the revelations to the former ones.

Greetings one and all. I have a very serious question about the creation of the universe and whether instead of it being a big bang, it was instead a big suck! What I mean by that is rather than the force of the explosion coming from within a certain point, a bubble was created in say perhaps a long sheet, and very much like if you put a thin sheet of cellophane over your mouth and suck in, the negative pressure creates a bubble inside until it bursts. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve done when I get a package of meat or food wrapped in thin cellophane. If you suck on the cellophane creating a negative pressure bubble it pops in your mouth and it makes a substantial amount of noise. And that&#39;s why I call it the big suck theory, and it also helps to explain why oftentimes, well, everything sucks! LOL I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the first person to have come up with this idea and it may be simple foolishness, but it certainly did have me thinking and wanting to ask the question. Thanks to anyone who can give me a rational answer and not simple nonsense, much as my theory could simply be, and most probably is, nonsense.
It is high time our scientists who fatalistically look for LAWS OF NATURE to then follow slavishly, realize the TRUTH Carl Jung mentioned: <br><br>&quot;I am not what happened to me, but what I chose to be.&quot;<br><br>  That is exactly how nature functions, that there are no laws of nature to DISCOVER but INVENT OUR IDEAL LAWS to sustain evil free life function eternally, and then analyze nature to design the means to implement so formulated ideals.<br><br>Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle and Einstein&#39;s special relativistic conclusion &quot;that no physical experiment could ever prove whether the earth goes around the sun or the other way around&quot; are clear practical indications of this TRUTH, even though the 2 great physicists themselves did not emphasize, or may be even realize, this fact.<br><br>There are no laws of nature independent of what we ourselves do in it. On the contrary, nature permits implementation of the laws we design as most suitable for our own sustenance. Hence, the challenge is to formulate the laws of nature that would enable evil (predation, disasters, diseases ~ which includes all violence, and death) free sustenance of life function for all beings, and design the means for their practical implementation.<br><br>It is a totally misguided conclusion of scientists that we are mere observers of nature. <br><br>We are not. <br><br>We are feelers AND influencers of its flow.
For Wolfram&#39;s idea of calculating the future weather based on the current speed and position of each molecule, and assuming that we have infinite computational resources, does the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle prevent an accurate solution of the future weather?
The uncertainty is part of the initial conditions (where are the relevant molecules at the start of the computation?). If you were to compute all the way from the start of the universe, you might claim, that it does not matter - but then, as he said, there are may ways the graph could develop.
Exciting when wolfram talks to physicists. Too bad it‚Äôs just this guy. Terrible interviewer. No prep, no organization, just winging it and cruising through
Mr Green is as good an interviewer as he is a writer.  His sharp vigilance made this a delight to follow. Merci √† vous !
he is good at interviewing other scientists, he is not afraid to ask the hard questions :)
Agree, and also a great teacher. I&#39;d recommend the talk with Joe Rogan (and watch Rogan&#39;s talks with Neil Degrasse Tyson as well). It&#39;s extraordinary how those two gentlemen can explain very complex subjects in easy-to-grasp examples.
Our understanding of intelligence has traditionally been limited to the cognitive abilities of humans and other living organisms. However, recent advances in quantum physics, complexity theory, and computer science have opened up new possibilities for understanding the nature of intelligence and its potential manifestations and yet still panpsychism has it wrong. It isn&#39;t conscious intelligence in non living systems. It&#39;s algorithmic, and it is a non sentient process.
Keep watching these Wolfram vids hoping one day his theory will make any sense to me. Still not there im afraid. Maybe it&#39;s just beyond me. Brian at least kept it interesting trying to pin him down to something coherent.
You just need to watch Cellular automaton game of life videos. Easy to understand building blocks, then just add 4 dimensions
Remember guys, if no one is thinking differently, is anyone even thinking?
Im a dipshit from nowhere that happens to like quantum physics and everything astronomical. Its my humble opinion that you guys are thinking waaaayyy too hard. Isn&#39;t science the practice of making observation agree with experimentation? The veiw doesn&#39;t matter as long as you&#39;re aiming for the correct end result.

This was AMAZING!!! I&#39;ve waiting for this level of discussion of Stephen&#39;s project because it really seems that it is at least inspiring and rigorous enough to shine some broader light on it than it has received. Of course it doesn&#39;t predict any constants of nature nor can it be used to predict accurately any aspect of reality but THAT is the size of the en devour he has taken. It is like going from quantum mechanics to human beings or real life objects, ITS HARD. He and his team are trying to do that but from an abstract formalism of space time and reality to particles or quantum physics. I&#39;m glad this conversation happened and I hope that it might get more people interested.
from quantum mechanics to human beings or real life objects, while seems like redefining space-time in computational context, it is unimaginably hard, not just HARD :)
Excellent point. Frankly, I&#39;ve never really taken to the &quot;dramatics&quot; of either Greene or Wolfram, but here they surprisingly bring out the best in each other....what I finally get is Wolfram&#39;s point that the &quot;rules/laws&quot; operate on each &quot;quantum&quot; of space, and energy is the frequency of iterations. Revelatory. And his skepticism of &quot;spacetime&quot;......but I still see a block universe...hmmm....

The ruliad is all encompassing but we are working out the details, that&#39;s the jist I got.... sounds fantastic. I learned more about SW&#39;s emotional response to his theory than the tenants of the theory he is proposing..
I have one question for Stephen ‚ÄúWhere is the Beef‚Äù? He did showed us two videos which he showed in first ever YouTube video three years ago. I was hoping for some details on the last three‚Äôs progress. I am from Missouri.
Probably the best interview with Stephen Wolfram I have ever seen. And I think it&#39;s because Brian was trying to understand just like most of us, and he asked the right questions. I walked away from this understanding Wolfram&#39;s work much better.
Stephen&#39;s causal edges  at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=7700">2:08:20</a> sounds like the causal connections in Tim Maudlin&#39;s discrete space time approach. I guess the similarities are obvious because of the assumption of granular space and time. And there is a similarity between Stephen and Tim when they say time and space are not same kinds of things. Time is an intrinsically directed idea. In other words spacetime(4D) think of it as space(3D)+time(1D).
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=7590">2:06:30</a>, Stephen mentions the time dilation happens because of computation effort expended while moving, i.e., in re-instantiating the object at different locations, but for the objects in the same inertial frame, there is no time dilation. In other words, the time dilation is only between two different inertial frames. The proper time does not dilate for self frame. Therefore, his explanation did not make sense. In other words, time dilation is a relative phenomenon between two inertial frames and not as absolute phenomenon for a single inertial frames.
I appreciate how the spiraling void behind prof. Greene feels thematically congruent with many of the concepts discussed somehow.
Stephen&#39;s approach in terms of quantum mechanics and BRANCHING histories is similar to BRANCHING aspect of Everettian many worlds approach. The distinct feature of Stephen&#39;s approach seems to be the possibility of MERGING of histories. But only the BRANCHING aspect seems to be consistent with what we observe.
Stephen l,very bright, yet his reasoning is extremely flawed on the grounds that observers like us had no option than to discover 20th century GR and QM physics: tell that to the aborigens of the amazon or else. Stephen is looking at the world with his 21 western glasses and makes foundless inferences.
The first thing to note the sincerity of how Stephen approaches answering the questions compared to Eric Weinstein. That is why  putting Stephen and Eric in the same kind of buckets of fringe physics is a big mistake. IMO Stephen&#39;s approach is very serious and it remains to be seen if it pans out. Sure. Also note how Stephen deals with challenges posed by Brian&#39;s questions. Wonder how far Brian will get challenging Eric&#39;s ideas.
I am sure Eric fanboys will disagree.
I&#39;ve never commented re: EW, but I see your point.
Please add chapters to this magnificent exchange
You couldn&#39;t have put it any better, so to speak!
Brian, please be honest and stop talking about the Framework of Strings as a Theory.
By far the best Wolfram talk I&#39;ve heard.  Kudos to Brian for asking the right questions.
The role of the interviewer is so key so to understand another person .... totally agree.

Both participants in this conversation did an excellent job communicating really tough concepts.  It was a pleasure to watch, even besides all the fantastic information.  <br>Bravo!
Set them free (leave them alone), give them the chance to become real humans! just to get deep understanding of the fundamentals of physics that could take up to few hundreds of years, then they have to connect both levels (subatomic and cosmological levels),‚Ä¶etc so how can human thoughts help the sick irrational thieves?!  deeper understanding of the foundations of physics is far much harder than all accomplished physics till now (that will need real rational intelligent human entities), cooperation, continuous hard scientific work,‚Ä¶. etc what can a bunch of irrational thieves those who live under the cloaks of some former physicists do ?! there are no miracles! is it about media, propaganda and faked prizes?! but science doesn‚Äôt work that way! or they are already addicted to their delusions?! set them free of you, they don‚Äôt need anything from you!
It‚Äôs Science no a game! It needs real rational intelligent entities!<br>Can media and propaganda create real scientists?!

Great when brilliant people admit we don&#39;t know why there are 3 dimensions, compared with I don&#39;t know anything but I know God created it.
They steal and pollute human thoughts gradually (can the irrationals deceive human?!)<br>Human thoughts will never fit into the realm of the irrationals (completely different realms), human thoughts need cleaning up of current physics (only future generations can do that). the only thing the irrational thieves can do is eliminating the only chance future generations have, and why ?! why?! to please the irrational thieves?! the dignity of sick irrational thieves?! what kind of dignity a bunch of irrational thieves can have?! can you comprehend?! current physics already reached its limits because it contains mistakes and lack deep understanding of the fundamentals of physics, so how could human thoughts can help them?!  they think about history?! future generations will be able to know the past including all the crimes against humanity (take it from human),  it‚Äôs nearly impossible to argue the irrational thieves because they don‚Äôt possess human characteristics! the only thing they can do is depriving future generations of their only chance. patchwork techniques will never work because there‚Äôs a real problem with the current understanding of the foundations of physics! human thoughts can‚Äôt help the irrationals, they are specifically for future generations only.
Two scientists I was following separately are now in an deep intellectual conversation. This is eye opening as expected. I can‚Äôt help seeing in Brian‚Äôs eyes being positively surprised and excited to hearing new conceptual framework.
How true!

My bathtub is a good model, I just need some neutrality buoyant bodies to swirl around in there, seriously, fluid and its waves have and can teach us some more about physics, this is basically your model you are replicating or trying to compute in computer simulation form, but does not affirm what space really is, though we need to try something. The easiest way to do that is with something, hence the atom of space.
I&#39;ve been following stephens deep dives into thermodynamics, and it&#39;s great to see him use what&#39;s he learned strengthen his arguments with the great Brian Greene.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=4173">1:09:33</a>  I love this metaphor of the &quot;pale&quot; diagnosis.

You scientists are all the same you seem to always think that reality has to come in the particular flavor of your particular field so is it surprising that people in IT industry think the world&#39;s made up of bits.  You&#39;re so predictable and in a real way pretty pathetic
Even if Wolfram&#39;s physics&#39; project doesn&#39;t pan out, we can still appreciate the tools, the new conceptual ideas and the interesting computations and the entire framework of discrete physics that he and his colleagues have developed. Simply astonishing work!
I agree. The older I get the more I get used to the idea there is no one &quot;tool&quot; to unlock the entire universe. We need a tool kit. The more tools in the kit the better work we can do.

@@JohnnyComelately-eb5zv Have you heard of string theory?  The issue i have with people panning what wolfram is doing is that how long has it been since there has been true forward motion from the standarn model.  String theory have given us what again?  Quantized gravity has given us what?  Other then exactly what both Wolfram an Greene talked about, which is more tools which to use to analyse the universe from.  I think what is truly innovative about Wolfram&#39;s approach, is it&#39;s completely the opposite of the approach of all those others I just mentioned.  They are trying to model from the very bottom.  Rather then try to assign some similified equation to what we are seeing, he is starting from saying can we just simulate at the finest level of the universe up.  Which may or may not be the right approach, but at a minimum i truly can see that what he finds out is going to give us a very different way of looking at our current models, and possible ways to go deeper.  Maybe his approach is frankly impossible, but it might give use insights into how to improve our models of relativity, gravity, or quantum field theory by understanding how these models might be simplifying what is actually happening, and how to deduce that, etc... and give use ideas on experiments that would show us how to disect these higher aggregate models. He just started this, it&#39;s like a few years old.  Imagine where it could be as we improve calculation, it also might be the exact kind of things that ai might be able to help use with.  AI i doubt would be able to give use general relativity or relativity period, or even quantum field theory before it existed.  As it requiresd complete giant leaps in how to view the problem. But starting from the bottom might lend itself to much more linear thinking, which I think AI has so far proven to be good at. ie here are some concepts along a line, and now extrapolate further along that line past where we are currently. That is something AI could possible help with.  <br>Anyway, at this point I would just be happy if we start putting a great deal more ephasis of graduate work into anything else besides string theory, etc...

They used YouTube scrapers from the beginning to collect human thoughts, one woman has collected all human thoughts in psychology in one book then attributed them to herself and other one but the funny part is that the other one has denied that human thoughts belong to him (no exaggeration at all)!<br>The irrationals found a booty !
I have recognised that from the beginning: the irrational thieves will not be able to resist stealing and polluting human thoughts (I warned them from the beginning not to steal and pollute human thoughts because human thoughts are the exclusive properties of future generations of mankind only and no one has the right to steal or pollute them in anyway), I knew from the beginning that they have no morals, no values, no principles based on that and minds to maintain them like humans, but I had to take the risk for the sake of future generations only. they took the advantage that mentioning the existence of human is taboo and that human thoughts have no rights! but what about the rights of future generations?! human thoughts have origin, passed through human thinking process,‚Ä¶. etc, what will happen to human thoughts when sick irrational thief entities steal and pollute them?! different minds, different logic,‚Ä¶. etc , the result is terrible disaster (human thoughts will become useless). they wrote books only out of human thoughts (no exaggeration at all), they attributed human thoughts to themselves ! they started with the most important part (human thoughts about psychology: self concept, personal identity, consciousness type one and type two,‚Ä¶. etc) future generations will need all that clean (intact), they will need all that to survive (future generations of mankind are your descendants).<br>They will mislead your descendants badly.

Take the useful summary: He wants to imitate human thoughts (he wants to be first), but he has no understanding.<br>He is only in hurry, similar to many others to be the first one.
In the last four years they have nothing except stealing and polluting human thoughts, it become a trend.

Each sick irrational thief thinks that he is the only or first thief.<br>Actually they know that they are not the first thieves but because they have no morals, no values, no principles based on that and no minds like humans, that‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt feel shame like humans, in addition to that mentioning the existence of human is a taboo on planet of apes (watch that movie ‚Äúplanet of apes ‚Äú 1968 version is better, to understand what the irrational thief apes did to human and how they worked on erasing human traces)!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=3470">57:50</a> he has read human thoughts similar to many other thieves no doubt about that, he takes human thoughts as a reference (space is one indivisible unit and time is a process,‚Ä¶.

Yeah 100 % this irrational senile is one of the thieves, he used both blunt theft and thievery as patchwork techniques (similar to car thieves who repaint the stolen cars to hide their theft crimes).<br>He is one of many those who take human thoughts as reference of truth to steal and pollute (silly thieves, version)

Is there any rational entity that would replace human thoughts with what the irrationals have regurgitated ? Just send the message to the next generations of humans clean (intact), and do not bother your miserable selves ! They will have the ability to know the real source! and any Attempts to erase human traces will has no use! find another job except science ! what for polluting science?! to put more obstacles in front of future generations?! what a kind of dignity!<br>They are trying to imitate human thoughts, that‚Äôs very clear, they take human thoughts as a reference of truth (polluted version).

The way Wolfram described time is the way time works in a video game. The changing of the whole system state from one to the next, and in this case, it is a long line of 1s and 0s. And a change to the long line of 1s and 0s code is a change of state. If your PC cannot process that change fast enough, then the frame rate in the game slows down. This can actually be related to speed C (causality/light) and time dilation. Everything he says, is consistent to if we live in some virtual system.
And that‚Äôs just 1s and 0s. Imagine 1-9‚Ä¶ surreal and beyond all humanly comprehension.

At time 2.28.28. in the conversation something wonderful  and very&quot;cool&quot;emerged.
How have ideas in physics and astrophysics come to this since 2020? A spherical universe consisting of a flat surface with no inside or outside. From a void with nothing but Quarks at the lowest level. How did we get to this point? Why was the relevance of mass to vibration announced and suddenly understood in 2023? You are following a planned progression that is being sold to you. Certain actors, always with the same faces, market this. Why did they start to be mentioned &quot;this way&quot; in the functioning of knowledge today?<br>Think about these questions.
&quot; there&#39;s not much else it could have been!&quot;
great interview, thnx! <br><br>It seems that the final answer to the fundamental question on wheather is it possible to reduce the surrounding physical reality to computational code/computational procedures has been received -- according to S.Wolfram, yes it&#39;s possible! science is really on the verge of a magnificent revolution in the ideas about the universe and about ourselves as humans in such a computational universe.the consequences of all this look very astonishing and should cause serious concern about the near future - the cycle of such a computational universe cannot last forever - it looks that we are very close to the end of the life cycle of our observable universe we live in.
‚Äú my years of bellybutton searching have led me to‚Ä¶.‚Äù<br>Nothing. <br>But clicks on platforms

Nice long talk. Thank you for sharing. Nice to see you 2 talking constructively some instead of cultology. Right now G.U.T., T.O.E., String theories all need work and fail at bell test and quantum eraser and delayed choice. They are all looking for some of the same things. Double slit or single slit. E.M. defraction gradient from the pinch as a sub harmonic or such. Hidden variables modeling is what your all dance around. Some place needs to make a place for constraints, limits, bounds for hidden variables modeling. As well as possible solution sets, theories. Tests that have ruled things in or out and that pertains to hidden variables modeling. Schrodinger equations can be ether sub-harmonics, relic artifacting, or part of the solution set, larger equation. Q.C.D., Q.F.T., Q.E.D., T.Q.F.T., Ect.... could be used as checks on a hidden variable model that doesn&#39;t have the Schrodinger equation in it. (byproduct variants)<br><br>Black holes have solution set&#39;s  though missing some. Schwartzchild for particle mapping to energy density regime and time slices. Kerr for G-flows and hyper surfaces and quantum boundaries. CERN for particle zoo mapping  or wiki info. With Q.M. you can find killing fields in the changing energy density regimes  one way. Degeneracy melting and island packing fuzzy problem another way. Time dilation factors or distortion ratio over the whole thing. Pick your favorite 2 string theories and 2 preferred Q.M. theories and see which says what. Try to bridge some things. Q.F.T. Black hole mapping leads to a killing fields boundaries as particles fall in and what types of particles can live or be created in which energy density regime. Spherical Russian doll inbeding due to energy density regimes. <br><br>Because boltzmann was brought up and multiverse in a way. Using the universe as a natural cutoff regime in C* to calculate a boltzmann time bomb. The size of the universe when the last particle decays into photons/radiation and time losses meaning. Use that as a natural cutoff and put a sister universe next to ours. Then rewind to current time frame or T=0 and you have calculated the next over/out probalistic universe. Nothing we will see due to being so far out. Superfluidity and superluminal propigation in Q.F.T. boundary layers as a medium is a way that works for homogeneity and not FTL inflation. It also would say the flashover point for the universe  was 12.5 light year diamiter +/- a error %, Schwartzchild. One way T=0 propagates out for over 6 years before flash over. Another version each field sheet gets punched through or collides. Punch through and deposited I have liked lately. But that variant is T=0 the 12.5 light year diamiter flashes over all at once. <br><br>I would like to see more cross field collaborations and constructive evolution to real problems/questions that should have answers. I would love to see anyone else map the vanishing points/killing fields for the particle zoo in black holes and energy density regimes. I would like to see string theories or Q.F.T.&#39;s that use or produce the universe as a natural cutoff regime. Even if just a check. Q.C.D. mixing in superfluidity. I would love to see the island of stability for antimatter and doubly magic shell models of antimatter. The island of stability for antimatter needs to be filled out. Theoretically and experimentally. I would like to know about the A and S8 tensions along with some J.W.S.T. tensions. I would like to see more hidden variables modeling and possibilities. Does a multiband/white light double slit with prisms pointed to overlap for a gradient pattern. Do you get multiple rainbows or fringes/bars within a larger rainbow spectrum? What can the universe as a natural cutoff regime tell you or say about theories? At any rate keep up the good work. Question everything. Good luck in wonderland.

You are brilliant!!!!! Love your shows.
There is no 2d, 3d or any of the above in reality.  2d&#39;s existence is dependent upon the observer.  The same for 3d, it&#39;s a more complex render but it&#39;s existence is dependent upon how close the observer looks.  Dimension&#39;s are imaginary.  It&#39;s a way to describe Euclidean space with math.  In reality there is only one dimension and it&#39;s the &quot;Universal Present&quot; - Time.
I happened to tune in at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M&amp;t=75">1:15</a> in the video.  Wolfram seemed baffled to respond to the question of how the universe begins within the framework he&#39;s proposing.  To explain himself he invokes the undefined concept of &quot;the ruliad&quot;, ties that into the supposed differing perceptions of humans and aliens about physical laws (because each are &quot;clumped in&quot; to their own specific region of the ruliad) and goes on to suggest that the universe started with &quot;infinite&quot; dimensions that gradually reduced to what looks like 3 dimensions to us.  Maybe I should have watched more but it sounded loony to me.
Hi. I studied the Wolfram Model for about 3 years now, and i&#39;m pretty well versed on how it works (from an outsiders perspective, but none the less if your looking for purely formal details, you&#39;d have to talk to the folks working on it directly)<br><br>The Ruliad is an eternal and infinite object. It both encompasses all events of the past, and all events of the future, in all possible ways in which that evolutions could unfold. Therefor &quot;The Big Bang&quot; is just one place in this object.<br><br>To describe what this Ruliad object actually is on a formal level : It is the state-space of a fully computed Turing Machine. The state space of a turing machine is &quot;all computable functions&quot; as outlined by Alan Turing. But the Ruliad goes a bit further in that, due to the principle of computational equivalence, which is that all subsystems in the universe are also turing machines, and where each turing machine output is the input (program) to other turing machine inputs, then the Ruliad is the space of all possible ways these turing machines could have computed inputs and outputs. The reason it has structure deals with the convergence and divergence of these input and output states (like how 1+3, 2+2, 5-1 and so on are all equivalent to the number 4, where the output of 4 is a convergent state for those rules, and you can imagine that there is an infinite heierarchy of convergent states, depending on what rules are being run, by which particular turing machines)<br><br>To expand on the principle of computational equivalence, which is extremely important to this, is that because all subsystems in the universe are equivalent to a turing machine, these subsystems are also equivalent to each other and to this infinite ruliad object. Therefor there is a deep connection between the subsystems in the universe, and the universe itself because of that equivalence. It&#39;s also due to this equivalence, that the perceivers of the object will behave relativistically and therefor how one interacts with other subsystems and the universe, is through a frame of reference...susceptible of course to said effects. This is easy to see when you think about things like Graph Isomorphism : Take a network graph, and pretend you are one of the nodes in the graph. If you were to switch your perspective to another node, you are perceiving the same object, but from a different perspective, and this might give you non-trivial differences in the PERCEPTION of that object, like coarse graining or the obfuscation of other nodes from your point of view. Good examples you can find online are visual illusions where a cylinder casts a circle and square shadow on two different walls. Ones reference frame determines whether you see a circle, or a square, or the actual shape of the object which is higher dimensional<br><br>Another intuition based example: you can imagine the 2d representation that is typically used to describe spacetime relativity as a graph with nodes (which is exactly what it is) and when you bend and warp this graph as is normally done...that is effectively what people do to perceive the same object, where it&#39;s properties although equivalent, take on these dualistic often paradoxical relationships (space expansion, time compression)<br><br>Coarse graining is also one of these relativistic qualities that is important as to why we percieve physics in the way that we do. Coarse graining is the idea when you look at some system, you take all of it&#39;s particulate information, and then you &quot;blur it out&quot; to see what the aggregate information is. For example have a look at white noise... when it&#39;s far away or blurry, it will appear like a single homogenous color (grey) but up close, it contains all the little black and white pixels in all of it&#39;s random complexity. This procedure of looks at something far away, trivializing it&#39;s scale (like a human being, trying to perceive air molecules in a room) or blurring out and more generally simply omitting information about a system because that information appears to us as just noise, is coarse graining. In the Wolfram Model, course graining of the evolution by observers i spoke about earlier is ALSO happening. When you have these states : 2+2, 1+3, 5-1 and so on, all of these different rules are converging to the same answer (4) and so we don&#39;t get to fully acknowledge the entire evolution for what actually led to the answer. The nature of us as subsystem (computationally bounded observers) is what restricts us to only observing these convergent coarse grained behavior of the evolution of the universe.<br><br>Hope some of this helped a bit. Wolfram has a few writings online you can read, but i highly recommend watching his &quot;New Kind of Science&quot; series where he annotates that book. In that book he proves formally why principle of computational equivalence is true, and that as a result, things like the Ruliad and the Physics Model, fall out of it as a result. It&#39;s really a pretty elegant set of logic and proofs and it&#39;s worth your time. Cheers.
@@NightmareCourtPictures you are wasting your time explaining stuff to disinterested trolls.
@@NightmareCourtPictures  Freeman Dyson, after reading Wolfram&#39;s book A New Kind of Science offered that, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tradition of scientists approaching senility to come up with grand, improbable theories.  Wolfram is unusual in that he‚Äôs doing this in his 40s.‚Äù
@@johnstack3338 I‚Äôve looked into some of the criticisms of New Kind of Science. Flat out I just don‚Äôt agree and haven‚Äôt seen a reasonable counter argument.<br><br>For instance, Aaronson‚Äôs counter argument was that the proof for Rule 110 being Turing universal, was not a strong proof but a weak one. I disagree with that because the proofs for universality are pretty straight forward: can x emulate a Turing machine, if it can it can compute what a Turing machine can, which is clearly demonstrated in the book. Additionally if Aaronsons argument was credible it would invalidate the premise of universality of Conways game of life‚Ä¶which is a cellular automata operating on simple rules that can emulate a Turing machine. That‚Äôs been proved without a doubt so it‚Äôs ridiculous to pose that argument for rule 110 which is also a cellular automata running on simple rules that can also emulate a Turing machine.<br><br>Other criticisms like Dyson also hold no weight. Science is about doing experiments and forming proofs and wolfram in that book did very clear experiments to prove the assertions made in that book with exhaustive proofs (a very strong form of proof) such a quote is not science at all and is therefor just an invalid opinion. Until people come up with actual counter proofs to what was shown in that book, which I highly doubt will ever happen given how strong they are‚Ä¶so I‚Äôll pass.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and look into these kinds of things for yourself. To do so requires many years of studying traditional science to pinpoint what is wrong with traditional science, so it‚Äôs not easy, but when you do you will inevitably come to the same conclusions of Wolfram (that the universe is basically a computation)

I wonder if Stephen Wolfrom has put his computational science/philosophy to work on the question of other living beings in our universe. It seems ridiculous to think we are the only life, and it seems ridiculous to think that cellular based life is the only life form. Wonder if he has spent any time trying to come up with a form of potentially intelligent life that is not cell based. The human imagination at this time appears to be insufficient to come up with anything. Though it would be insufficient in coming up with a cellular based biology if we didn&#39;t have a model to study.

Thank you both very much for sharing your time and work, Stephen and Brian, have a great night, peace
This was such a great conversation.  I‚Äôm so glad I got a chance to hear it
It would be a billion times better were Stephen coming up with these concepts three years ago when I&#39;ve  put much more out to him. Sadly, only I have been owning precise frameworks and most remarkable discoveries about reality for these years, and everyone of these pop figures are too lazy to do a thing to expand their good models to find this or that themselves, really.
Again, the path to particles could be me - haven&#39;t shared that before cause been researching that again all by myself - all these SM terms are not very aligned with intuition - but yeah, all SM partices perfectly are perfectly linkable to the line of naturals of total universal computation in my framework, and you know what? There also could be no other particles - that&#39;s from these same two-three (one, actually) principles Stephen mentioned in the beginning (1D of time -&gt; comparisons {observation} -&gt; masses of comparisons)

What Stephen wolfram books would be on this topic of the ruliad and ruial space? Im almost finished with the four percent universe and about to crack open indras pearls. I‚Äôm interested in this observer concept, is emergence the same as consciousness and when an entity emerges and starts computing information regardless of the dimensional scalar or manifold they interpret  , we can then conceptualize possibilities alongside gravity or dark matter , one could start to imagine just these simple fluctuations in mathematics inside of a black hole to theoretically become ‚Äúentity‚Äù or ‚Äúemergence‚Äù, these dimensions don‚Äôt necessarily have to relay on a human to conceive it, because we use these terms fluidly, it helps to understand further computations on the way we define geometry.

I&#39;m interested in applying theories of computation to physics also, but I think the more natural starting point is from metaphysics.<br>A theory of computation is useful in physics because it bounds the mathematics with which physics is described.<br>It&#39;s useful primarily as a meta theory, as it describes the language we use to describe the universe, rather than the universe itself.<br>I think there should be some meta theory of the sciences in general, and that the way to get to the physical theory is first to solve the more general theory of formalizing scientific logic and investigation.<br>If you could automate the scientific process, would that qualify as AGI? It&#39;s quite a general kind of intelligence, and in some ways beyond the scope of an individual human intelligence in its generality.<br>Personally, I expect measurement uncertainty, and uncertainty pairs to be the basic ingredients of this kind of scientific logic. It seems to me that every scientific process must assume some relationship/differentiation between measured order and disorder as the first step in producing logical statements about the universe.

The quest to understand cosmic origins is a profound journey into the fundamental questions of existence. By probing the earliest moments of the universe, scientists aim to uncover the conditions that led to the formation of galaxies, stars, and ultimately, life itself. Advances in cosmology, such as observations of the cosmic microwave background and the study of primordial black holes, are helping to piece together the puzzle of how the universe began. As we explore these cosmic origins, we face an intriguing question: How will our discoveries about the early universe influence our understanding of cosmic evolution and our place within this vast, ever-expanding cosmos?
our place within the universe is  much much less significant than an ant crawling over  an ant hill , ant hill earth

There you have a slightly hilarious idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSpace-Time already occupied, wrinkled/curved by the action of the Matter-Energy/Dark Matter fields of the gravitic interaction between this Existing Matter and Energy. Now take into account the other fundamental forces known so far and imagine the entanglement that could result in successive, functionally or logarithmically smaller scales.<br>The notion of observable, Quantum Gravity,...Spaces or Holographic Universes was left out.<br>Pay attention to your second question, it is worth making the distinction between the cosmological microwave background radiation that is observed in the observable Universe and the local radiation, say a few parsecs of fourth dimension or in a Minkowski space, if you want to call it where condensed matter is scarce (stars, planets, dust).

But they&#39;re not asking the one question that I have, which is how the changes in time from the expanding universe affects us. Does our time here on earth speed up or slow down? Are we aging faster or slower? Does it make planet Earth spin faster or slower? What impact does it have on our own little corner of the universe from our planet, to our solar system, to our galaxy, to the cosmic string that our galaxy is a part of.
Greene seems in the past few years to try to bring up the superstitious questions and I don&#39;t think they have a place in discussions about scientific facts.

If it actually were to be true then we should still be able to see that same process in action today. If there was one big bang, why only one? Why is it that the energy from  an exploding star spreads out through our space over a period of time but the big bang did everything in less than a second? Where is ground zero for this big bang and wouldn&#39;t it be the most barren part of space with every celestial body moving away from that point rather than them moving in random directions? The big bang would have caused an immensely high pressure that would have radiated out in all directions, leaving behind an area of very low pressure in the vacuum of space? If space is truly a vacuum and there was a big bang everything that came into existence would still be moving faster than the speed of light away from the event and that doesn&#39;t account for the formation of solar systems with the rotation and spin of planets and their moons.

I really enjoy watching these videos. It has to be said that It doesn&#39;t matter how many times string theory is plugged. It&#39;s still what it is. Beautiful math but non science.

OK, Black Holes are ?  Electrons and Photons in Equilibrium. Why is this likely so. Because we know Binary Neutron Stars when they coalesce form a Black Hole. Neutron stars are made of Neutrons, Electrons and Photons but they are not quite in Equilibrium. This would indicate that the pre Universe before de-coupling, when it was in Equilibrium of just Electrons and Photons would have quite simply been a Black Hole. All be it a Mega Massive Black Hole. The Big Bang Theory states this pre Universe condition. The problem with the Hubble constant is e measure distant objects like Type 1A SN, The light from these objects is bent by mass en route, so we may measure something at 6 Million LY whereas the true distance is 66 Million Light Years because we measure curved light. This would mean every measurement would have to be done individually to take into account the Light Curve. This is likely why Measurements and Models do not agree. Now if we compute the de coupling of a Black Hole we can envisage streams of Dark Matter as small remnants from this decoupling which is likely why the de coupling process includes Dark Matter in Big Bang Theory. This may also be related as to why Super Massive Black Holes are detectable in the first 150 Million Years of the Matter Universe. I suggest most Dark Matter resides on the outer edges of Galaxies and at the Core of all Galaxies. The outer Dark Matter is v small where the inner Dark Matter is Super Massive. However the outer Dark Matter is by Mass 5x Inner Dark Matter. This equates to the Proton Neutron balance after De Coupling.
It‚Äôs a weird feeling (conjecture) that the dark energy-matter may come from extra dimensions with which we cannot directly interact
Brian time is not linear, space is an illusion üåü
The issue with the ether is that it is also a part of us but has multiple properties of resonation that obscure it&#39;s variable change at small enough levels with high enough multiple inputs, coupling, turbulence, and fluid mechanics eventualy it phases resonation to curve space so far that anything effected by it is stretched to obscurity which appears as both there and not there (the uncertainty pricple, SCHRODINGER.. the threshold is that to get to see things this variable or thus finite you have to catch up it in curved time. So to curve that small is the same as curving to obscurity.. as we deem lightspeed the fasted mode for human observation, the space that fine takes so long to shrink that far that the light we would need to send thats fast enough to catch up to it has a wavelength that doesn&#39;t confine to that space and creates a black hole. A magnifying effect that we see as a laser because lasers are concentrated enough to curve entropic  resonation into inverse flow rippling with turbulent vertices with enough energy input concentration to invert into duality and back around inversely to positive gain over systematic orientation
Fluid mechanics is a great way to think about it. Space is a variable neutrino ocean. Vacuum is an effect comes from multiple dynamics. Things such as QCD and the coupling along with effects through a resonating variable field that each change eacother with variation, inverse in nature, but universal under properties. Adding in things like chaos theory, refractional vertices making with fluid like mechanics and dynamics of influence such as the von Karman Vortex streets... ultimately with enough coupling reordering phasing curvature and inverse inputs that at a high enough phase efficiency that space curves enough to invert flow energy in the reaction. We need to understand our own phasing evolution with spacetime, both it outside of us yet phasing in parallels smaller than the Planck length. So things like resonation whips apply, yet as you look from a  far enough point you can view refraction patterns and detect wave pressure energy. Either we are the edge of this evolving constant that looks like waves through time and particles at the edge where quantum tunneling properties lead evolution, yet a closed system under repeating values that show patterns in matter and energy. If we aren&#39;t the particular point of the &quot;current&quot; ..right now, the present, connected instantaneous with past evolution through refractional reverberations but are the evolving invading phasing pulsating points of multiple resonation rippling coupling sets that have evolved to curve space enough for us to continuely phase through it, but we are actually phasing ourselves as wave partical duality that has evolved to resonating with enough finite energy they appear to be points our elementary particles and the oscillations inbetween with pressure refractional duality

The question about the origin of the universe is superficial because we will face this question every time: What is the origin of this origin?
Why do you say? How did the universe begin? Existence may have always existed and we are now just a stage in this endless path
None of the panelists is aware of the elephant in the room -- the empirical heuristics cannot go beyond the empirical boundaries.  If the physical universe is all that is (this, after all, is the grounding ontological postulate of the Empiricist), then, as far as the empirical project is concerned, the question of the beginning of the universe is ill-conceived. An empirically framed question about the origin of the physical universe is self-contradictory in that it affirms and denies the Empiricist&#39;s grounding ontological postulate. If everything is matter, then to inquire into the origin of matter is to inquire into its nonmaterial beginning. Similarly, if everything is ideal, then to inquire into the origin of the ideal is to inquire into its material beginning. To put this succinctly, an inquiry concerning the origin of x presupposes the existence of y, such that x ‚â† y.  The Scientist is a poor philosopher, indeed.

Even if you repeat this unlogical old stuff a thousand times a day, refute the 1.0 experiment and I believe you everything you want. By the way, the fifth dimension explains what dark matter is.

With regard to the expanding universe theory, couldn‚Äôt it be that only the region we can see happens to be expanding? What I mean to say is the universe is unfathomably large. Maybe the visible portion of the universe for which we exist in has been thrown by the great attractor as we spin around the thing. Maybe if there was a way we could zoom out far enough, and somehow map a much much larger portion of the universe, we would find quintillions of strings and webs of galaxies, spinning around some insanely large black hole we call the great attractor. Nature is cyclical after all. It doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable to imagine this idea of mine could be the way things are.<br><br>Ah, what do I know? I‚Äôm just a music teacher.

I dont think Supersymmetry exist in our universe, but they could exist in another parallel universe next to ours, that could explain the dark matter that gravitationally interacts with matter in our universe but were not able to detect with current instruments due to the supersymmetric particles acting as the dark matter in our universe while they exist in extra dimensions or a parallel universe right next to our Universe.

One idea to explain the scientific observations of ever expanding, infinite, ever accelerating universe could be that the creation &amp; destruction of matter from energy or microwave and vice versa is a continuous process and happening at every point of Universe all the time but in a cyclical way so as to go through various modes from microwave, to the most elementary sub-atomic particle, to gradually heavier and higher level of particles and atoms and again exploding into smaller particles and energy causing in the process nuclear fusion, and fission convergence, explosions and all those events that have been recorded in the observable universe so far. As the universe is infinite and this process has been going on infinitely when measured from any point at any time it will appear as the Universe is expanding with a beginning from the Big Bang but actually there is no starting or ending point of Universe as it only appear so in measurement. Seek Brian&#39;s or other scientists&#39; comment on this idea.

It‚Äôs interesting to note that there are some discrepancies in classification of wandering space planets,  rouge,  planemo,  or not quite a brown dwarf.

The microbes most likely aren‚Äôt the only forms of extraterrestrial life somewhere out there and in all actuality it‚Äôs only a matter of time until a point in space exploration opens up something truly beneficial to humanity,  maybe not soon or maybe not later but scientific possibilities are paramount to a self aware,  sentient understanding.
All started from a cosmic energy, it evolved into multiple energy, theory of evolution follow through, all may continue to infinity.
Scientists and cosmologists have discovered that the most distant galaxies are receding from view at a rate faster than those galaxies closest to us. They made this determination by observing the red shifted light from the distant galaxies and applying the Doppler effect. So they conclude that the galaxies 13.8 billion light years away are moving away from us much faster than those that are only say 1 billion light years away. But are they neglecting time? If we see red shifted light that left a galaxy 13.8 billion years ago compared to light from closer galaxies that is not red shifted, aren‚Äôt we observing what happened in the distant past compared to the much more recent past? Wouldn‚Äôt the expansion of the universe actually be slowing down, not speeding up? The faster galaxies are much older than the newer, slower galaxies. The fast moving galaxies were receding at the highest speed 13.8 billion years ago. Doesn‚Äòt this actually indicate that the expansion of the universe is slowing down?

What is the big bang, so to speak, is the &quot;white hole&quot;, &quot;The One&quot; that no longer exists as of &quot;now&quot; linearly, from which every black hole leads back to from the beginning to the end of infinity? But infinity is absolutely calculable as which all black holes control time though gravity, crush space, time and distance through gravity back to its own beginning recycling the Universe infinitely from trillions of points inside itself, forever back to the beginning of space/time creating infinite instances for eternity from start to finish through itself for all eternity...think about it. Think about what makes sense from what we know so far. On the opposite side of time is EVERYTHING where dreams and life and souls and consciousness really reside before, presently, and after linear existence where all souls and lives spawn from one source, outside of time, where we all dream from while we&#39;re living individual linear lifetimes from the one source. Where we all are when we die and also dream from. We really are all one eventually with our creator and our source soul creation, which in essence is ourselves as a whole and one with our Universe which is God as a whole as One with all of itself. But every soul and every life plays its part in turn for all to be known for itself and all knowledge by the end of all life in and of itself so it knows everything from start to finish by the end when there is no life existing anymore anywhere in the Universe as itself from Alpha to Omega infinitely recycling itself through itself forever.

Have zero education. Not capable of understanding what Brian Greene is talking about. I love the fact that someone could know what he knows, to me, it&#39;s like magic or religion except I know it&#39;s real. I completely admire these guys who dedicate their lives to explain the universe. I&#39;m a gardener in Ireland. This is all I watch. I think that Brian Greene would sit down with me for a pint and not look down on me for my ignorance but would respect me for my wonder and interest.
I started reading and listening to physics and cosmology lectures about 10 years ago and I didn&#39;t understand most of what I read, but what I did understand was intriguing. Don&#39;t give up, the more you listen the more you will understand. I&#39;m at a point in time now where I&#39;m really interested in finding more about the mathematics. After all science is about seeking what we don&#39;t know . And you know the old saying, the one thing I know for sure is that I don&#39;t know
You write pretty articulately for someone with zero education.
I applaud your honesty and wonder for the universe. The good thing about science is that you don&#39;t need a background in mathematics or science to learn more about the universe. There&#39;s no end to the books and programs(online or not)that approach science from a beginner&#39;s level. I would learn more about science if I could do mathematics, but unfortunately, I have no ability or aptitude for math. I&#39;m grateful for programs like this one, they make science accessible for people like me. I think you&#39;re right, people like Brian Greene don&#39;t look down on us for our ignorance, they probably would have a pint with you if they had the opportunity.

Before Brian greene became as famous as he now is, I emailed with him after his first book was published and he was still only teaching.....before the other aspects of his public intellectual career expanded....<br><br>He wrote back to me....we exchanged 3 or 4 emails......he was extremely generous with his time considering that I&#39;m a university drop out and not at all formally educated in sciences.....<br><br>So...I think that speaks to his intrinsic character and humility...he emailed with a complete stranger merely because I had curiosity, questions and ideas to share.....
Probaby a stupid question but, since we know there is a thing called low background steel (steel made before atmospheric testing and Hiroshima) this must indicate that there is a low level of atmospheric radiation due to the fallout from all the nuclear detonation that occurred back then.  How do they distinguish the difference between that radiation and the big bang radiation?
I imagine that it is because the measurements and photo&#39;s of the background radiation are always taken Outside the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.<br>The type of radiation would depend on the material and its concentration, I am sure that physicists have devices which are able to detect and differentiate between all types-from whatever source.

It&#39;s not our origens that matters. It&#39;s our future that is important.
Good questions from Brian. Very disappointing to hear them not acknowledging that MOND predicts the rotation curves correctly, not needing any dark matter. Also that dark energy is way more farfetched than assuming everything is homogenius in the universe. Other than Brian and slightly Adam, this panel was very closeminded
Imho &quot;Dark Matter&quot; and &quot;Dark Energy&quot; simply are a result of magnetism. Objects, on Earth, rubbed together cause magnetism: attracting and repelling forces. Same goes for anything else in solar systems and galaxies.

Wow, kudos to the graphics people! Great visuals. And so well coordinated with Dr. Greene&#39;s explanations so that what he is saying advances our understanding of the principle being shown in the visuals.

I can‚Äôt understand that we can be so sure of what the data tells us means. For example I would not be surprised in an infinite big universe all objects will look as they go away from you over time.
I maybe wrong here since the panel is highly elite but I find trying to compare blackhole singularity with the singularity of the universe highly illogical. How could we compare singularity of simply highly dense objects existing in space to trying to find out origin of space-time and everything unless and until we think blackholes are not dense objects rather some simple objects made out of dark matter or dark energy? That too would be illogical cause they emit radiation. We would be ruling out holographic principle altogether if we try to do that. Cause according to our current understanding of black holes --black holes means simply too dense objects which lack space that&#39;s why even weightless photons of light can&#39;t pass through that--they radiate from their boundary event horizon obviously but that could be misleading to treat them as objects containing space. As per the holographic principle information is encoded on the surface of the blackhole and through entaglement we could retrieve that information through radiation and information is preserved. While in ordinary case we could entagle two particles and interact with them while we can&#39;t do that with entagled particles which are not emitted from the blackhole. So basically in the universe outside blackhole we have bot h ends of the puzzle under our control while that&#39; not the case with blackholes. So I think comapring blackhole singularity with singularity of the universe is just as vague an analogy as it could get!
Brian was made to do more than others, but the wildness of our world doesn&#39;t allow smart people to be proposed to rule the world, if you can see rich people they are all abused and traumatized.<br>So don&#39;t wonder why rich people are so stupid.<br>He should receive a budget to help humans and have full  control of the project!<br>Better believe in Brian than God üòÇ.

I am captivated with Brian&#39;s intellect and humbleness.
It&#39;s always good to remind ourselves that ancient stories, old theories, or recent science can go wrong. We have to remind ourselves to be humble when we discover new information that dispels our understanding and brings us into a new light. I don&#39;t need to feel bad when someone (especially religions) is stuck in the past with old, outdated information. Paradigm shifts always come from ages to ages, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br>Brian Greene is always good as a host!

Someone help me to understand where these events come from?  When you go to the WSF site, and click on &quot;upcoming events&quot;, there&#39;s nothing, but whenever a video is posted, you go to &quot;upcoming events&quot;, and there it is, posted as if someone went back in time and posted it.  Are these events things that one can buy tickets to and attend, or do they mystically appear in the past from a parallel universe?  Not annoyed, just wondering who all the people are in attendence and how they got there.  It would be fun to attend a live event.
America needs a president like this man. Brian needs to hurry up and solve string theory so he can run for office.
This is a rehash of what we already know, which should tell you that progress in this field has been glacial for many years.
Or that you have to make the dark matter and energy because our Omniscience can make dark matter completely how they want
Because dark energy and matter is emergent
Dark energy is with dark matter and they are everywhere and they contain all the information like starting from the probability contained in the field with a fine field

BACKGROUND RADIATION is just distant nonvisible stars (density is more or less the same through the entire INFINITE UNIVERSE) which light is reaching us, but we cannot see them due to our poor resolution and too short time of light collection from one spot in space

EXPANDING UNIVERSE is just a crazy illogic idea CONTRADICTING ITSELF unless EARTH is at THE CENTRE WHICH DOES NOT EXPAND, which is ridiculous..................and accelerated universe is obtained DUE TO PHOTONS IN THE RAY BEING SPREAD/SQUATERRED ANGULARLY, NOT ONLY LOST IN SPACE TRAVELING THROUGH IT (called (nonexistant) dark energy)
Wish they dived into alternate theories of origin, like CCC or multiverse
fairytale tellers.....................LIGHT is like a handful of sand thrown forward, therefore FREQUENCY can be changed not only by moving away/towards, but also by losing sand particles in the ray (THAT IS WHY DISTANT GALAXIES HAVE LARGER RED SHIFTS WHEN ROTATING which is called (nonexistant) dark matter or black holes...science needs healing from these insanities)
My wife and I are so thankful for Professor Brian Greene and his presentation of such important and interesting topics üôèüôè.

General Relativity and the Quantum Mechanics world still haven&#39;t been linked up. While there may be a lot of possible reasons for the weird stuff we&#39;re seeing, I think one of the fundamental issues is our lack of a unified theory of physics.
With all seriousness would tardigrades survive a black hole?
Propably
Wish Brian Green goes beyond his judai Christian history... There are so many advanced theories in the east which have now been proved. At least give the respect to civilization from where these  theories were copied. All history just starts with ancient Greeks and Romans

God of explaining the physics of universe.üëè
thank you Dr. Greene but alas your guests didn&#39;t want to address the final topic.
I think I lost brain cells with this narrative.
What about general relativity? It‚Äôs no longer just a theory. It‚Äôs now an actual observation. That considered, it is the actual state of the universe. Now considering the fact that gravity drops off exponentially outside of a galaxy that means the effects of gravity on time and distance drop off exponentially so time flies by and a yardstick to measure distance is much longer relative to where we are under the effects of gravity. This means all of our measures of time and distance most places we look in outer space are way off one way or another.<br><br>The actual distance of the galaxy is very important because there is dilation of the distance between us and the distant galaxy. In fact many calculations of distance and speed are off because the dilation of distance is considerable where there is no mass between us and the observation. The result is that everything is much closer to us than they appear to be. Added to that is that time also passes by faster wherever there is no matter or mass between us and the observations. So there are two factors. The distance isn‚Äôt as far and the time it takes for the light to reach us isn‚Äôt as much setting up the scenario of a much younger universe. <br><br>So before you consider something imagined like dark matter and dark energy, try to understanding it with known verifiable observations. When you observe things in outer space it‚Äôs not like looking at a dog or a cat because locally the measures of time and distance are flat or constant. On larger scales the measures of time and distance are NOT constant or flat. They change. This means the measurements of time and distance change. (It means the speed of light changes.) Everything away from the mass of a galaxy is moving faster. The spiral arms of galaxies are moving faster and superluminal motion is said to exceed the speed of light seven times and we know that‚Äôs not the case. <br><br>When distance expands it means that the distance is less than it appears to us to be so the spiral arms aren‚Äôt moving as far or as fast as they appear to us to be moving besides the fact that things take place at a faster rate of time in the outer arms since the clocks are moving faster away from the main mass of the galaxy. <br><br>The vacuum energy of space has been linked to black holes absorbing time and space, not because of inflation. Redshift is due to the fact that the light from distant galaxies is passing by or through more mass and gravity in order to reach us where we are in a much smaller galaxy. <br><br>If a tree was in motion with an apple, the apple would be in motion too. There‚Äôs no infinite acceleration. Only if the jet containing a tree with an apple was always accelerating, the apple would fall. <br><br>They say everything is accelerating but not if all gravitational forces were pulling on it equally. It would have no acceleration and no slowing down of time and no contraction of distance. Light would pass through such a place instantly. That‚Äôs why light passes between galaxies instantaneously. There‚Äôs no significant amount of gravity to slow it down as the entire universe all around it is pulling on it.
I hear time travel|
The speed of light isn‚Äôt constant because time and distance aren‚Äôt constant. It‚Äôs not complicated. There is so much wrong in cosmology. It‚Äôs almost entirely based on assumptions, assumptions of dark matter assumptions of dark energy assumptions of a universe expanding from nothing into oblivion for no reason assumptions of a single age of the universe and the assumption that everything just appeared from nothing like magic. Redshift is from a light source from a greater mass. Distant galaxies are more redshifted because of the greater amount of mass that the light has to pass by. The vacuum energy is from black holes absorbing space time, not from imaginary inflatons. Dark matter is assumed because the correct differing measures of distance and time are not being taken into account. If there was a cat the size of a galaxy it would be thin in the middle and its much larger arms and legs would be moving faster than the rest of its mass.<br><br>Matter and energy cannot make or direct themselves and they are only going from order to disorder disproving the idea that they made and directed themselves. The problem is that cosmologists are not considering the actual evidence in front of them. The evidence is one giant elephant üêò in the room that the (secular) scientists try their hardest to ignore and pretend the elephant üêò isn‚Äôt there when the elephant üêò of actual physics is there. The speed of light is NOT constant because the measurements of time and distance are NOT constant throughout the universe. In our observation of light from distant galaxies the light only slows down when it encounters the mass inside of a galaxy according to general relativity which is an observed fact. There‚Äôs no excuse for scientists to be making up their own version of physics.
I allways think the best scientists have the best analogies for how wrong science can be ,,it brings everyone on board. Adam Riess is brilliant.
Yeah, he is üòä
Nice talk. You need mods in your live chat or might want to turn that off if no mods. Religions showing how bad/evil they are. You might want to look at the paper for S8 solution. It might help hubble tension. Mapping neutrinos through dark matter halos will tell things about Wimp or dark sector interactions and neutrinos. Particle production in given energy regimes and gravitational waves needs to be looked at. Energy density in a given space and curvature needs to kind of be gone back over. As far as big bang modeling. Being real below 12.5 light year diamiter it is anyone&#39;s guess as long as it fits a few things. Quantum degenerate matter Islands with a shared quantum state or single point foliation/sheafs/particles/strings. Nested shells/sheets with super luminal in a medium propigation or gravitational collapse wave spreading out or sheet punch through and 12.5 light year diamiter flash over or dimensional collapse depositing onto a string brane or Q.M. universe pair production. You get the idea. T=0 and before and shortly after should not be taboo. Let the flood gates open and see if there is a way to test between models. Do the constraints on quantum foam ( smoothness of space ) match up with C.M.B. fluctuations? Has anyone looked into hawking radiation artifacting. Trail, spherical, dotted, ring/s. Or looking at neutrino artifacting. One handed 3 generation broken symmetries in first gen particles that survive. Q.C.D. axioms relicing on C.M.B.. I would like to see a neutrino detector for C.N.B. ( cosmic neutrino background). Neutrino modeling in neutron stars and looking at double shockwaves in super nova modeling. Finish modeling interiors of black holes. The energy density regimes that specific particles can live in. The Q.M. killing fields. Sounds like a game or movie lol. Before T=0 can be theorized. Penrose eaon, String sheets, boltzmann time bombs, primordial collision, even super computing super artificial intelligence inductive testing if structured and formed right lol. The point being it should not be taboo and logical routs explored. Keep up the good work and good luck in wonderland.
What?
I have a theory and I&#39;m quite serious about it, and that theory is perhaps we got sucked into existence. Just like the sheet of Saran Wrap over your mouth and you suck on it creating a balloon inside until it pops. That&#39;s why I caught the big suck Theory, instead of The Big Bang Theory, and helps explain why oftentimes everything sucks! LOL okay the last line was a joke, but the rest in the beginning I was quite serious about
You are thieves. And this is true. This will not change!
The title of this though ü§Øüß≤üíñ
Since Einstein abolished absolute time - how can anybody say something like &quot;13.8 billion years ago&quot;?  &quot;Ago&quot; refers to &quot;now&quot;, which DOES NOT EXIST, at least not in a cosmological context! Brian, please explain!
Einstien stated time is RELATIVE-/you can only measure it RELATIVLEY...the present to X(here &amp; now to there and then/13.8 billion years ago) is RELATIVE so I dont see the issue?
Now existed. And when someone says 13.8 billion years ago, they&#39;re referring to the approximation of now that existed within the timeframe they said/thought it.
Space is not the same for all observers, time is not the same for all observers, but the spacetime interval is. It is said to be &quot;invariant&quot;.
‚Äã@@r1nger81What we call &quot;13.8 bil years ago&quot;. Could that same event also mean something like &quot;8 bil ago&quot; or &quot;21bil  ago&quot; for another random observer? Or not?
13.8 is an estimation based on the limit we can detect distant astrological objects due to the speed of light reaching Earth bound observers. Yes, it is a quantum limit that impacts astrological observations. That&#39;s all it is. The universe may well be older, but we are limited to what we can sense through our telescopes and our computational math.
Man great conversation absolutely awesome
What is the frequency of the original light? You need to know that, and it better be One Single Color.

Zero is the most important number in mathematics and is both a real and an imaginary number with a horizon through it. <br><br>It&#39;s geometric counterpart zero-dimensional space is the most important dimension in physics and is both a real and an imaginary dimension with an event horizon through it.<br><br>Black holes are ten-dimensional:<br><br>Zero is the only number with a horizon through it. <br>Zero-dimensional space is the only dimension with an event horizon through it.<br><br>So, has to include a 0.

Their geometric counterparts 0D (quantum) and 10D (cosmological) would then be the event horizon boundaries of this side of the mirror universe.
[2D is not the center of the universe,<br>0D is the center of the mirror universe]:<br><br>The mirror universe theory is based on the concept of parity violation, which was discovered in the 1950s. Parity violation refers to the observation that certain processes in particle physics don&#39;t behave the same way when their coordinates are reversed. This discovery led to the idea that there might be a mirror image of our universe where particles and their properties are flipped.<br><br>In this mirror universe, the fundamental particles that make up matter, such as electrons, protons, and neutrinos, would have their charges reversed. For example, in our universe, electrons have a negative charge, but in the mirror universe, they might have a positive charge.<br><br>Furthermore, another aspect of the mirror universe theory involves chirality, which refers to the property of particles behaving differently from their mirror images. In our universe, particles have a certain handedness or chirality, but in the mirror universe, this chirality could be reversed. <br><br>Leibniz or Newton:<br><br>Quantum mechanics is more compatible with Leibniz&#39;s relational view of the universe than Newton&#39;s absolute view of the universe.<br><br>In Newton&#39;s absolute view, space and time are absolute and independent entities that exist on their own, independent of the objects and events that take place within them. This view implies that there is a privileged observer who can observe the universe from a neutral and objective perspective.<br><br>On the other hand, Leibniz&#39;s relational view holds that space and time are not absolute, but are instead relational concepts that are defined by the relationships between objects and events in the universe. This view implies that there is no privileged observer and that observations are always made from a particular point of view.<br><br>Quantum mechanics is more compatible with the relational view because it emphasizes the role of observers and the context of measurement in determining the properties of particles. In quantum mechanics, the properties of particles are not absolute, but are instead defined by their relationships with other particles and the measuring apparatus. This means that observations are always made from a particular point of view and that there is no neutral and objective perspective.<br><br>Overall, quantum mechanics suggests that the universe is fundamentally relational rather than absolute, and is therefore more compatible with Leibniz&#39;s relational view than Newton&#39;s absolute view.<br><br>What are the two kinds of truth according to Leibniz?<br><br>There are two kinds of truths, those of reasoning and those of fact.

I am crazy but i should create big bang with concerving  space time fabric and matter to build microwave background

I love the idea of explanations being Just So stories without more evidence. Once you know what those are, the explanation is crystalline.
Yeah, for an idiot like me, it is very crystal clear üòÖ
The fact that we assume dark matter does not interact with light (it does by altering photon‚Äôs path gravitationally), suggests that these dark matter particles are as small and dispersed as they need to be, that very seldom collide with photons if at all, therefore, best explanation is- At a certain point the energy we must put in a collision in particle accelerators would create a self sustaining singularity, so we are limited in seeing smaller particles in the particle soup we can observe or conclude with detectable permanent or short lived particles. What we can‚Äôt detect is anything smaller than 1.6x 10^-22. Dark matter
I want thatu you see my activity google equation
Is it possible Traveling in a universe that is spinning in its expansion making every photon take a curved path while waving, to become our default setting for the shortest path, and since we have to collapse it to observe it, we assuming a ‚Äústraight‚Äù path; then when we add the stand alone gravitational lensing amplified by that universal curvature, could it be why it‚Äôs appearing as if we need more mass for that outcome?

What if the big bang is the inevitable conclusion to the cyclical eons? The universe produces itself over and over by colliding every particle together at once on the other side of the &quot;30 quadrillion (random #) years&quot;?

Starts slowly get seperated and isolated by gravity and the seeming expansion. Ultimately, it ends up split back apart to random radiation, electrons/protons, quarks, &quot;individual pieces&quot;, by black holes and the totality of entropy and the uniform, eventual degridation of everything. Then, with everything being reduced to the size that it could easy travel at light speed, warping space back in on itself, all the way back to the starting point where all of it collides back together at the end to restart.<br>We live in the most unimaginably large particle accelerator conceivable.

It wouldn&#39;t be only populated by photons. The point is that no matter at what scale we are there is probably a force that looks similar to electromagnetism and a geometric phenomenon similar to gravity.

Could it be that as the Universe continues to expand, that maybe a new Universe has already started to form as a replacement for the current one?
Yes, just not here, yet.
Matter cannot be created nor destroy. According to NASA the Universe 13+ billion years, according to Mahabaratha  of India the Universe is 330 trillion years alot better than NASA. I say the Universe has no begining  and has no end. Matter just change form cycling thru time.
Why are you telling us that you never got over kindergarten level thinking?
Yes, the Big Bang was the beginning. From everything we can possibly determine scientifically.<br><br>What we have to realize, is that the name &#39;Big Bang&#39; itself was a pejorative term coined by Fred Hoyle, in disgust at the priest George Lemaitre&#39;s Primeval Atom, and what he saw as the overt religious connotations of such a specific creation event. All the atheist cosmologists preferred eternal models for the opposite rationale (no creation = no creator)<br><br> Hoyle never accepted it to his death in the early 2000s,  and atheist cosmologists have been trying to find a way around the obvious ever since.
Hoyle was a bit crazy. You clearly dropped the bit part. ;-)

Why would the observable universe expand at a rate any different from the rest? What we can observe is a function of distance from our location, no?

Once you approach extreme gravity fields, such as neutron stars and black holes, the normal attributes and effects of gravity is less severe within the local relativistic grid, because the matter that is caught in the gravity field is indeed light itself and gravity is a function of light, so the acceleration experienced by the subject is much more gradual and doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to spaghettification, because matter is fundamentally made of light, thus rendering a smoother transition within local fields.<br><br><br>There is a possible misconception that black holes are more destructive to local events, because we have implemented a differentiation between matter, light and energy. Proposing that light and motion are¬† the fundamental forces in physics solves several of the empirical findings in our universe - from local events to the very large.<br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is also a possibility that the laws of nature might change from region to region in the universe. Applying the same unified functions everywhere might not be applicable - based on the observer. Quantum Mechanics combined with holographic principles in conjunction with relativity might produce variations that are stable within physicality as a whole. But they might also produce temporal shift variations that might fluctuate between timelines, not compromising the stability of the system as a whole.<br><br><br>Temporal shifts pose little/no threat to quantum fields in macro or micro, because the energy transfer between two or several more points are conserved within holographic principles.<br><br><br>Best way to explain is superpositions of quantum fields. But using spherical understanding we might end up with hyperpostions in addition, meaning that within multiverse theory and/or paralell physics, we can propose that local variations might occur elsewhere.<br><br><br>One might suspect that this could be inherently unstable, but hopefully stability is ensured by <b>Special</b> and <b>General Relativity</b> in conjunction with <b>Hypertensored Holigraphy</b><br><br><br>QM &amp; QFT are ultimately functions of HH, because all forces, all phenomenons, energy, polarities and particles are fundamentally holographic, thus made of light.¬†<br><br><br>Diverge Planck and apply Hypertensorality to:<br><br><br>v=d-(t¬≥c¬≥)¬†<br><br><br><br><br>If one might observe local effects that seem irreversible to the observer, the stability/instability of said system might return to its relative position in space as they where when the temporal shift gradually occurred. A Rosen/Einstein bridge might be folded back onto itself, reestablishing pre-existing physicality relative to the initial motion through space time. Quantum Entanglement might provide a reasonable solution to reoccurance of paralell shifts that within time dilation could possibly be &quot;stored&quot; in the same field, but according to the observer. Matter and energy that exist in local time at one point might be shifted and parallaxed with EPR that in reality is the same as ER.¬†<br><br><br>Local EPR might occur continously between substances that share the same locally observed quantum field and the energy accessible could possibly be much greater than within relativity, because e=mc¬≤ isn&#39;t truly applicable when dealing with motion on a quantum level.¬†<br><br><br>When taking into account that matter in itself consist of light, e=mc¬≤ is rather moot. Energy is indeed conserved within relativity and as we know we can&#39;t break relativity within relativity itself, but when we apply quantum and holographic principles, we could propose that<br><br><br>¬†e=cc¬≤¬†<br><br><br>The accuracy of this correction must be investigated, but it is strongly suggested through quantum entanglement and holography that the state of energy in the universe is much greater than what relativity proposes.¬†<br><br>Corrections might be suggested and <br><br>e=c¬≥c¬≥<br><br>might be suggested within HyperTensored spacetime. <br><br>Considering sphericality to QE in EPR we might unlock a deeper understanding between gravity, relativity and QM. There might be spherical and macro EPRs that beam QE through quantum fields in absolute zero and this might give us access to zero point energy that is much greater than fission and much less complicated than fusion, because the input energy is more or less the device itself. Stability and security is better overall because zero point energy doesn&#39;t require usage of unstable materials...¬†<br><br><br>This has to be investigated further to test the hypothesis.<br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is never one singular source for any given system. There are always a plurality of systems and subsystems to ensure the stability and security of the spectrum of the laws of nature, physics and life. If there was only one singular source for any given system, it would ultimately lead to instability and degradation.<br><br><br>Stability of the laws of nature are almost impossible to compromise, because ultimately light is the very foundation of matter and gravity. Even though quantum mechanics might seem random at certain conjunctions, the configurations are governed by quantum entanglement that principally are benign in nature, because changes to the information/polarity exchange are secured in relativity that ensures a certain degree of stability.¬†<br><br><br>Complete equilibrium in any given system are prohibited by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, but it may at the same time be rendered void when entering the quantum realm, where exotic effects might be empirically observed. This is easiest explained by double slit experiments that prove quantum entanglement can not only give parallel energy patterns, but also plural outcomes without loss of energy¬† but possibly provide divergence of energy, thus rendering the 2nd law of TD moot, possibly invalid or maybe incorrect in its current understanding.¬†<br><br><br>This can lead us to energy production that leave us with little to no loss of energy. Runaway effects that might go critical such as in fission production are less hazardous, given the correct protocols are in place.¬†<br><br><br>Weaponizing quantum energy production should be avoided at all cost and is not feasible, because subatomic particles cannot be concentrated in practical weapons. Using such technology should either way be separated from military science regardless. Civilian and military sciences SHOULD always be maintained.¬†<br><br><br>How life itself originated is a whole other field and might be discussed both metaphysically and naturally. As I view it, I think it is interesting to entertain several avenues instead of focusing on a singular source. Life itself is pluralistic, so why shouldn&#39;t there be several sources without excluding any existing.<br><br><br>Information is fundamentally secure within systems.

Their explanation of how their system cycles is so convoluted and poorly explained. In comparison, the Penrose CCC explanation is very simple and clear.
how stupid are scientists??? I will give you this forecast/prophecy if you keep looking at the universe it will get bigger and older and you will have to bullshit your way through some explanation of why. whereas anyone that has ever learnt anything can see the more focus/attention/practice someone does the more their understanding magnifies data relating to the subject and it can magnify without increasing the amount of data. as one gets older they see more richness and complexity in the data allowing better decision making but the actual volume of data has not increased from when you weren&#39;t aware of such richness and complexity. I really hope this makes sense to someone out there.  I don&#39;t have any issue with the age of the universe as the bible says, the age of the universe at the moment scientifically and the age of the universe in 10 years time which will be much different from the age today all of them can be true simultaneously
Who knows?<br>Who thinks they will ever know?<br>Who thinks anyone will ever know?
There is a mathematical description of the universe by a man called, Sotade Olusegun. His research publications are so insightful to explain the nitty-gritty of the Universe. I will suggest that you get his YouTube videos as you search through YouTube by his names. He usually puts the links to his research publications in the description sections of his videos on YouTube.
Well Well!  So you&#39;ve finally decided to think sensibly... Ugh... FINALLY!  Science is suffering from unbelievable arrogance in insisting it is the ONLY institution that has EVER or WILL EVER have a grip on cosmological truth.  DOH!
Could someone explain how your range of causal contact can decrease when the universe is contracting? During contraction everything comes closer to you. So shouldn&#39;t you get into causal contact with more and more matter? They said that somehow your horizon can shrink faster than the rate the universe is contracting. There is something I&#39;m misunderstanding here.
Given the early evidence being gathered by James Webb Telescope of fully developed spiral galaxies (which takes billions of years typically to form) only 300 million years after bigbang event seriously raises question about the age of the universe and validity of BIg Bang theory as the standard theory of cosmology. Whether it is Cyclic Universe that can better explain cosmology only time will tell. We just can&#39;t sit on our laurels and refute various evidence including problematic inflation theory. Thank you Brain Greene for bringing this wonderful program. Special thanks to Peter Galison, Anna Ijjas and Paul Steinhardt for their wonderful insights on cosmology. Brain, it would be tremendous if you can invite  Andreas Albrecht, Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, Neil Turok and Peter, Anna and Paul to debate &quot;Is Big Bang theory as standard theory of cosmology no longer valid? Thanks.

The information maybe interesting, but the unpleasant background music disturbs much. I can tell you the purpose of this music. It jams your brain and critical thinking, and thus you get an easier pray to commercials or political messages that are imbedded in the video or are issued afterword.
Yesh, something even more terrifying exists now
So at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=74">1:14</a> Steinhardt posits: Evidence is that inflation rate is increasing (due to dark energy) but if the potential energy curve (driving this expansion) is positive but declining than at some time it could become negative and the universe changes to slow contraction. <br>I don&#39;t understand what he means by &quot;the potential energy curve&quot; so will just take it on faith.<br><br>Next at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=78">1:18</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=80">1:20</a> Galison talks about polarisation of gravitation waves (recorded in the CMB?). Again, I don&#39;t understand this. The CMB is light. Can it record a gravitational signature? (analogous to gravitational lensing?)<br> <br>And at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=81">1:21</a>Anna mentions the Simons Observatory is looking for such signatures. Such a signature would be proof of inflation but not finding a signature doesn&#39;t prove the Steinhardt model. Merely that the inflation signature is beyond the sensitivity of the Simons Observatory.
So amazing watching this ringside view of scientists trying to figure out - what do these observations mean for our theories? Brian works his magic of bringing the rest of us wondering human family into this discussion - the modern campfire!
It hit me like a ton of bricks. Our measure of expansion is what we see, not what is out there, because the information hasn&#39;t reached us. I read and accepted &#39;inflation&quot; back in the 80&#39;s, and I always suspected it didn&#39;t matter how or why in the first second. The entire universe acts like a black hole, but once it gets too big it breaks, and it will happen again. This talk is simple and amazing. When spacetime warps and contracts, we wont see it coming.

The ether was pretty well established at some point in time, until Einstein provided special relativity as an alternative. I am looking forward to the time, when inflation suffers the same fate...
Ether was a non observable. Inflation is.
How much time \ input do these guys spend with the software designers and programmers that code \ produce these software simulation applications?

Personally I think the event of the big bang has happened multiple times in different regions of space creating different &quot;universes&quot;
How about this man, if the big bang went off and expanded in all directions, where is the opposite force of the bug bang? Could we be in a 2 universe system? Where there exists an opposite universe with the laws of physics turned 180¬∞. Seems plausible to me.
Do I sense anger between this guys? üòä
Greetings, Brian, I&#39;ve been watching many of your videos and i&#39;ve learnt a lot. I&#39;m not physicist or scientist, merely interested in learning. I&#39;d like to ask you a question, if i may. You&#39;ve been talking about all these issues and problems, such as the quantum entanglement. I am curious, you believe that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, as i can presume from your works. I&#39;d like to ask whether there is a possibility that Dark Matter or Dark Energy may be able to go faster than the speed of light, and whether the question of entanglement may be solved by the presupossition that two particles are connected by Dark Matter or Dark Energy and therefore no matter how far apart they still click together. Thank you for your time. Bless your heart for the hard work you put in and enlightening the world for free :)

Happy we can throw inflation in the bin. Always disliked it.
What an astounding presentation! Many years ago I saw a similar event at Cambridge University where we were introduced to plate tectonics I feel this is going to prove to be equally profound. Four very, very clever people including THE science populariser of our age have come up with an alternative to something that has always bothered me. I can usually grasp the rough idea and communicate it but inflation (in the cosmic sense) had me utterly baffled, I feel a lot better knowing that I wasn&#39;t losing it. Utter respect to all of you especially Anna whose passion shows clearly. To have achieved so much while so young is doubly incredible, to explain it in another language with such clarity is staggering.

There&#39;s a concept of cyclical time and the universe in Hindu scriptures, especially Rig Ved . It talks of eternal creation and destruction of the universe and time. Shiva is the entity that drives the time and Vishnu controls the space. Shakti is the energy that gives birth to matter. Time dilation , which has been proven, the Mahabharata says 100 years  of Brahma is 311.04 trillion years, which is roughly the life span of our universe.This concept given in these scriptures make me see everything with a scientific eye and encourage my curiosity to know more and more about our universe. <br><br>&quot; There was neither non-existence nor existence then;<br>Neither the realm of space, nor the sky which is beyond;<br>What stirred?

this talk sheds a lot of insight into how the scientifice oligarchy works to stifle new, emerging, and innovative ideas.
What idea&#39;s do they stifle? Otherwise you just left a logical fallacy.
The brightest objects in the universe, such as GRB 221009A and AT2021lwx, can be observed using light, thanks to Einstein&#39;s discovery of photons. This allows for a deeper understanding of the universe. The work of some of the greatest minds in physics, such as Einstein, Hubble, Eddington, and Penrose, who have all contributed to our understanding of the quantum nature of light and the existence of black holes and singularities. We can scientifically prove the mechanisms behind supernovas and black holes, there is no evidence to suggest that the universe was created this way. The sheer size of the universe, with its billions of galaxies and supermassive structures, suggests a much longer timeline than the currently accepted age of 13.8 billion years.

Albert is correct. God does not roll the dice.

What you See or observe is Not equivalent to what you do Not see. How can it Ever be equivalent? Because you are always seeing something and that‚Äôs why we say there is something rather than nothing regardless whether everything was created out of Nothing or not. Observing something or a phenomenon is better than not observing anything at all. Intuitively speaking, what you see (does not include) what you do Not see. Always. There is a Hidden realm that us Humans do not understand or compute (beyond what is observable, aka the observable universe). Actually, in computable terms there is nothing hidden really it is just that is impossible for us to See everything (that‚Äôs why we use fancy words such as the hidden realm‚Ä¶ etc.) However, why is it called a measurement problem? Because it is nearly impossible for us to keep measuring! Since we are all made out of matter and energy, we are all embedded in Spacetime. We are Spacetime. Limited configurations or arrangements of matter, energy and time in an all infinite cosmos or space that necessarily repeats. Remember it is a cyclical universe preordained in phases where it seems and feels like you are not measuring anything at all. Cyclical means it is necessarily Reversible as well. However, when we do measure and Observe, we find precise configurations of these arrangements of matter. For example, hydrogen has one proton and one electron (precisely). Hence, this entails a thorough ontological interpretation of questions such as why are we here? Why do we Exist?! There has to be something that is constant and unchanging no matter how these probabilities manifest, reveal or even Emerge. Light is always constant and absolute no matter where and how it is Revealed in the interplay and mechanism of space and time. You anchor your understanding and insight and orient your intuition onto what is constant and unchanging, as localized beings. It is an evolutionary mechanism that we‚Äôve acquired and blessed with (as humans). It is Nature by design. We always assign credences when we feel we need to broaden our imagination and creativity and augment our experiences of reality to what is readily Convenient for us to do so. A simple analogy from everyday experience could solve riddles or  conundrums about quantum theory üòÖ For example, I recline on the sofa when and if only it is at a localized definite spot. I do not recline on it when it is not! You use Occam‚Äôs razor because it is efficient to do so when you capture important features of a system using far less info than an exhaustive description would entail. It is not convenient to say there are multiple worlds regardless whether you can contain it all in one description of reality (one universal wave function üòÖ) or not. We are localized reflective beings even if we are emergent properties or just a mere abstract differential ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we also build credences on this new apparatus or template of the Mind.. it is a rubric in which it is so efficient for us to not even think at all!!! It is an evolutionary compass and you praise that, you praise your own human ingenuity. Besides, how can you Ever compute something (such as space and time) that suddenly Emerges? That‚Äôs why we still can‚Äôt prove whether the Big Bang was the begging of time in a cyclical universe. It is a purposeful pattern and purely ontological. It is causality at its core!! Physics needs to be backed off by philosophy or a coherent ontological theory!! Why is it called science? Because it has to embrace our common senses and intuition. If it doesn‚Äôt it is not science!! <br>It also explains why the universe is expanding beyond our horizon and computational perception‚Ä¶ it did not expand in the far past and has stopped there so you are able to ‚Äòprove‚Äô according to the laws of physics that we are only computational beings. But, obviously we are not üòè it is still expanding and keeps expanding into the future while you‚Äôre observing dark matter and dark energy being created, and embedded in it üòè so that you always take into consideration and acknowledge and account for what you do not see üòé
There is growing evidence, at last, that there was no big bang in the universe, although that is apparently how Jesus was born. My uneducated personal belief is chain reaction. Converting, let&#39;s say energy to matter. But more of my uneducated idea is that what we see, stars, galaxies, planets, and star stuff is not the universe, they are in the universe, which we cannot see, one might say because of the star stuff.<br>I like the term: cyclic universe way better than multiverse, which is a violation of the English language. And I like it because it carries the idea of infinity and eternity, my other beliefs about the universe. There cannot have been a START to the universe without a god, the big banger, and that can&#39;t fit into the small minds of religious fanatics.
No, the big bang couldn&#39;t be the beginning for two reasons.<br>There was no big bang, this or any other universe isn&#39;t created that way. Universe&#39;s constantly pass through one another and occasionally another universe is brought into being.<br>Time is not linear, there is a single moment NOW, within that moment  there are billions of parallel universes and dimensions, these can be meaningful Planck Time and in one second there are 14billion X 10million indivual shifts.<br>This gives the illusion of linear time. üí•

I&#39;m convinced from a philosophical and meta physical view that it&#39;s cyclical and infinite not necessarily in space but in cycles. Your multiverse is one in cycles not in dimensions.

A &quot;multi&quot;-verse remains a SINGLE UNIVERSE composed of multiple universes (like ours, which could be inside a black hole), ETERNAL and INFINITE that is continually TRANSFORMED and manifests itself in many, infinite ways, whatever they are called: Human beings, Galaxies, Quasars, Black Holes, Dark Matter, Singularity, etc...<br>The Universe or Multiverse only transforms: It is PURE ENERGY....<br>It is impossible to prove it, but it makes no sense to have a Beginning, or an END in time, or any Space LIMIT:<br>What could be BEYOND the Space &quot;limit&quot; of the Multiverse? Well, ANOTHER Universe...<br>And what could have been BEFORE the BIG BANG? Well, another Universe or Multiverse... And once ours cools down and perhaps COLLAPSES into a SINGULARITY, perhaps it will give rise to another Big Bang... ETERNAL...!!!<br>And most importantly: That Universe-Multiverse is GOD!<br>A God who does not reward, punish or monitor anyone. That he is not looking out for anyone. So ENJOY your life!
the greatest question is not why are we here but why are we here now
I just wish we could get science lectures or talks without ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS having to go back to the 1900s and be told what they believed back then. Anyone that wants to watch this, already know that. We want to know where we are in the current state of things, and whats next for this science.
Dr Greene makes it look so easy and relaxed meanwhile he&#39;s constantly calibrating and recalibrating the conversation for pacing, clarity, inclusion of the whole panel and overall cohesiveness.  He&#39;s just an unbelievably good host and, of course, always on top of the material.  Awesome presenter.
You‚Äôre definitely right, Greene is great, I loved his books and I love these videos
I was just thinking the same. I really learned a lot from him, and applying that in my work. But in this video there&#39;s a higher then usual amount of times he has to step in and correct hence you probably noticed it too just like me.
Indeed, he does a terrific job of managing the discussion.
I couldn&#39;t say it better myself. If all science teachers were like him, imo, we would have a LOT more kids into science and chase it as a career
Genius facilitator and leader, love these series.

I feel like these folks are putting in the same mental effort we put into explaining tying shoes to toddlers. They understand these concepts so thoroughly, they all kind of know where the other is going and it leads to a very cohesive presentation.

Zero entropy is a weird way to look at anything, as you can simply assume just limiting space/time to a point could be all entropy at the same look. It doesn&#39;t have to make sense that way of looking at entropy. Entropy is a deceiving concept. Personally it&#39;s always bugged me. Why isn&#39;t a singularity entropy anyway you look at it? Gr8!

Absolute origin prior to the big bang. Pre big bang and what is the infinate universe....at least ours because it&#39;s huge and infinate
Absolute Origin guides us always. It&#39;s so simple. The chair on which we sit came from wood which grows from Earth. Our atmosphere is always puƒ∫ling outward and have for years. Stop worshipping Einstein
Then who created the &quot;endless universe&quot;.......
You have to prove infinite has a beginning and end to prove the big bang theory, until then, fallacy.
What if spontaneous creation / destruction of matter and energy at the quantum level AND expansion / compaction at the cosmological level are not mutually exclusive? And what if the expansion is heavily biased in the spatial dimensions and the compaction is heavily biased in the temporal dimension?  Can you run your models using these assumptions and see how they might influence the model&#39;s ability to describe observation?
There&#39;s Absolute Origin. We all come from a place. The two stars that collided came from somewhere. They created the big bang so they have an origin also. They were formed by an entity. The vast space of our universe also and the universe outside us...
Looking at Einstein&#39;s proposal for an explanation of gravity we see balls of varying sizes resting on a grid. The big ones sink deeper than the little ones. This is using gravity to explain gravity.  BAD DOG! I can add one Cartesian coordinate to another and get a result. I have no clue how to add a Cartesian coordinate + time stamp to another. The concept of space-time is ridiculous!!
Hubble retracted his expanding universe theory. Halton Arp destroyed it. We&#39;ll never know how the universe began. The big bang theory is nothing more than a religious person&#39;s wet dream. How does a BANG result in a flat universe?  How can something infinitely small be hot? If heat is atoms jiggling around really fast where do the atoms jiggle in something infinitely small? I could go on and on. ....For example, how could ONE atom, much less all the atoms that make up the universe, fit inside something infinitely small? Oy! And BTW, what is infinite minus one? MATH IS NOT PHYSICS!!!!
it always bothers me if somebody is saying the universe is expanding into, into like what? so even if you imply there is something, you can not explain the universe. It has to be part of it right? Other wise our definition of &quot;Universe&quot; is not yet complete.
One thing that remains unclear to me in this discussion: If, in the cyclic model, inflation can&#39;t smooth the universe unless it was already very very smooth to start with, then how can the cyclic model produce a smooth universe even when it lacks the smoothing inflation?<br>Or maybe I need to watch this again with greater care...

Why we are here, there is no why, we just happened, no why.  One can ask how.
If you see a pile of broken glass on the floor, you don&#39;t know what it was until it is all put back together.  In a broken state it could be a bottle or a glass.  Our universe is the pile of broken glass, how can you think it was a bottle when it could have been a glass?
From singularity to end of inflation, the universe had no gravity, because no &quot;spacetime&quot; for matter to warp. So expansion happened very rapidly (inflation) and only BEGAN to slow down when gravity came into effect. Gravity implemented a decellerating slowdown of expansion until 5 billion years, then an unknown &quot;negative gravity&quot; was able to gradually accelerate expansion.<br><br>So gravity is the warping of spacetime by the presence of mass. Negative gravity SHOULD BE the reverse warping of spacetime by ??. The presence of ... dark matter?? No, sounds wrong ...
If you take parallel lines they look like they converge on the horizon from one point. Couldn‚Äôt cosmology be confusing contraction with an observational illusion?  Maybe movement away from each other is from another causal effect all together, like dark energy?  Maybe the increased heat of the earlier universe is just a period of more matter creating more star formation or just our view point causing us to see it as more dense than it really was. Maybe time is somehow an agent in this, perhaps it‚Äôs not linear?  Sorry maybe this still sounds like inflation. Maybe gravity and dark energy are in a balancing act and occasionally they get unbalanced, perhaps by entropy for instance.
Avoiding the obvious source of information as usual
The universe has beginning and no ending.
The end is the only thing that is certain
Google: how much mass does the sun lose per second. Answer: 4.7 million tons. So why is this imprtant. Where does this mass go? Gravity to me is the pressure dark energy exerts on matter that needs to find a balance and will seek equilibrium. All suns are conversions and all massive vacuum cleaners converting matters mass back to where it came from. And the accumulative conversion makes up physical volumes of what we perceive as the vacuum of space. Space grows in this process and all galaxies will drift apart over long periods of time - its almost like space is crinkled up on matter, and its relxing itself in the conversion - so long as matter is present it will always bend space time in its proportions and it will always cyphon itself back. Dark energy makes up approximately 68% of the universe and appears to be associated with the vacuum in space. Make the connection - its one thing.
This theory actually makes sense: how the universe was once in a condensed ball of mass and energy and the world sort of like &quot;exploded&quot;, giving birth to the universe.
Why do we talk with our hands?

Global Entity science vs religion series. There was an Islamic documentary explaining our existence on planet earth, the role of a single moon ( tilt and tides) and explaining our solar system notably the role of Jupiter and it&#39;s gravity pull that protects us from the asteroid belt. By chance the elements of probability hence life itself.
New science theories are more of fairy tales and fictions than real science; the contemporary False Science Religion of the commons (stupid!)
BS speculations, God Created everything and there will be an end of every thing. Your scientists and their calculations are not sacred and should not be taken seriously as you do!!!
To this day there is still no proof to say that it even happened, just theories.
So many imaginary problems from not understanding the observations. It‚Äôs the observations that are real and it‚Äôs gravity that is not being understood. We don‚Äôt need another law of gravity. Gravity is constant locally the same as the earth is flat locally. On a larger scale gravity is not constant and the earth is not flat. Gravity drops off considerably outside of the galaxy which changes considerably the measures of time and and distance which together make everything to appear to move faster including light. Things appear to be moving faster because they are moving faster as seen by us in our slower rate of time and our shorter measure of distance. This eliminates entirely the need for dark matter.<br><br>The changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the more distance expands and the more time speeds up the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is.<br><br>The energy source of the vacuum energy is all of the supermassive black holes that are growing by drawing in spacetime. This means that the universe is not expanding into oblivion for no reason. It means there is no need for imaginary inflatons. Redshift occurs when light leaves the gravity of a galaxy and then the light is blue shifted when it enters another galaxy. Obviously galaxies aren‚Äôt all equal that way and distant galaxies are much more redshifted because of all of the mass of the surrounding galaxies that distance light has to pass by.
Universe extends to infinity and has always been in existance. No beginning, no end, no creation, only electro magnetic radiation to infinity. Galaxies forming and unforming over and over forever. You are welcomeüòä

So all the universe knowledge is here on earth and we are correct. Sorry no thanks. Theories are not fact...just information pondered by learned humans. Doesn&#39;t make our theories correct. But its as close as we can guess. So either accept or reject. Humans will never solve the  existence of the eternal space/time/matter. Because its still so basic as the question, which came first, the chicken or the egg. Keep dreaming humans.

Just becouse ?is the best frase you have? Seriously? you are totally unprofessional ! whatever documentary videos you made. Real people don&#39;t look for fame in youtube!
This is the boldest and most intriguing idea in cosmology that I have come upon since inflation itself. I need to look into this more deeply. If true, then the implications are staggering, and many ideas from Hawking radiation to multiple universes are no longer viable or necessary.
True.  This is a landmark idea that may form the basis of the origin of the universe.
Absolutely marvelous presentation.
Couldn&#39;t this explain the Hubble Tension (around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=4560">1:16:00</a>) if the slope of the potential energy curve is different for different methods of determining the rate assessed at different distances? Just sayin&#39;.
Consider, the universe itself is living. If it is, we can surmise that it was &quot;born&quot; from the interaction of other pre-existing universes like our own with an endless number of other related universes filling the proverbial night sky beyond the realm of our expanding universe. All of it is alive and growing.^

When was this talk?
When I was in high school, I thought that a universe and its energy would dissipate beyond its event horizon in akin to hawking radiation, but only after achieving entropic equilibrium; returning its energy to the environment that birthed it.
I was dead serious and fascinated by this idea. It&#39;s been my dream to chase that question. But now I know to bite my tongue and question without assumption.
Nothing begin and will never end...
I still want to know what happened to all the planets , stars and galaxies that were around before the big bang.<br> We&#39;re they obliterated  ?  or were they just pushed out or are they still floating around within sight ??.<br> What happened to them ?

Right now, Penrose&#39;s take on conformal cyclic cosmology makes more sense to me.
It should be the leading theory.  Not necessarily Penrose, but if infinity is mathematically acknowledged, then who needs a beginning?  The future and  the past are infinite
Deep Thinking. Most cosmologists now believe the Universe has a diameter of 93 Billion Light Years. The Universe we see is traveling at 0.03% Light Speed. 500,000 MPH. if we calculate this backwards it would give the Age of the Universe at 1.5 Trillion Years Old?
The JWST has proven that our prior Theory of the Universe is not accurate. Either the Universe is older than we thought or the Early Universe was much more dynamic than thought. JWST has proven Super Massive Black Holes (10 Billion Solar Mass) at 150 Million Years after our Big Bang Theory. Think about that for a moment &quot;It takes our Milkyway Galaxy 230 Million years to rotate once (0.03% light speed)&quot;.... So Super Massive Black Holes formed at speeds in which matter itself would be torn apart? Hydrogen, 99% of the Early Universe,  spontaneously combusts at quite a low temperature. Therefore Direct Collapse (hydrogen gas cloud colliding with galaxy) and Primordial Black Holes (direct collapse of hydrogen gas cloud) would both be impossible. Yet JWST does prove Super Massive Black holes at 150 million years post Big Bang when the Universe was still at &gt;500 kelvin. Then there is the problem of expansion faster than light speed x100. So the Laws of Physics were not broken but totally smashed beyond comprehension? A Cyclic Universe is impossible because the Universe can only contract if there is a Gravitational Force to attract to. The Universes is speeding up due to it being dragged into a vacuum (99.997%) and possibly dark energy. The Great Attractor (part the largest gravitational mass we know of) The Sloan Wall, is several billion light years further into the Vacuum  than The Virgo Super Cluster in which the Milkyway resides. This Super Mass is beyond the Gravitational effect of an opposing Great Mass that may exist on the other end of the Universe at 93 Billion light Years. So contraction is not physically possible unless we have another total shattering of the Laws of Physics.

In that section they&#39;re talking about the history of these ideas and their cultural acceptance. The theological acceptance of the expanding universe is significant to the way Brian asked the question at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=838">13:58</a> . The dynamic universe was considered to be a religious idea, so much so that the Pope endorsed it. That&#39;s significant because Einstein didn&#39;t like the religiosity of the idea and thus resisted it.<br><br>He&#39;s just recounting that history, and in fact he&#39;s making the opposite point of the one you&#39;re worried about - he&#39;s saying that it being endorsed by the Pope made it <i>less</i> scientifically credible, at least to Einstein in the beginning.<br><br>Then later the evidence by 1933 is showing that the universe is expanding and Einstein had to give up that position, even though it was endorsed by the Pope and is in some way religious.

A 3  dimensilal manifold in 4D space can. like a klein bottle loop back into itself. Any path taken over its surface can be considered a time line in Minkowskian spacetime embedded in a 5 Dimensional higher space time.  As such all paths can lead back to their origin and begin again.  There is no need for contraction.   Plank&#39;s constant will vary across the surface of the manifold as will other such &#39;constants&#39;.  Of course for this to be a mathematical reality the manifold will be rotating, hence negating the folly of singularities, in a Kerr fashion. You need 5 vectors not simple 4 vectors to get through this but at least now you know the way your research should be going on your little Planet :-)  Unzicker might well find it in accord with  the thoughts of Mach and Sciama relating to Inertia.

Is there any reason to consider that the universe will stop expanding and begin to go the other way? No? So why not theorize that the universe will turn into candy?  Isn&#39;t that just as reasonable?

Well, all panelists were assuming that for a cyclical universe the WHOLE of universe has to expand and contract in cycles, but we have observed that local parts of the universe do contract to a singularity, each black hole observed. Mass and energy contract to a singularity and that is where a part of our universe ends and on the other side of the singularity, they are ‚Äúwhite holes‚Äù where new universes are formed, so each black hole in our observable universe is a ‚Äúbounce‚Äù but not back into our universe but into a new separate universe that we will never be able to interact with (since ‚Äúlight‚Äù / causality in one can no longer escape from one to another). Our universe itself is on the other side of such a black hole ‚Äúbounce‚Äù in some other universe. This has been happening ad infinitum so therefore it is like the chicken and egg, there is no beginning nor end.
People argue that since there are hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with tens of billions of stars each with tens of planets that by the laws of statistical probabilities there must be another intelligent species somewhere in our own universe. Sure there must be other intelligent species out there in each universe but the distances are so huge that there is no possibility of these intelligent species interacting. Additionally those intelligent species in other universes behind each black hole will never be able to interact. These enormous distances explain the Fermi paradox. Our own species should be amazed by the exceptional miracle of our existence and get along with each other rather than try and exterminate the minuscule amount of intelligent life that we have in our local bit of space.

We have no idea when the beginning started.  What we do know about is the current CMB, which we base everything on and what we believe is the beginning for the universe we are part of today.  Everything is born and dies over time.  Once visible matter eventually dies and all that is left, again, is the vastness of space, the process of building the next BB with remnants, quantum size, from the previous universe, begins.

You have to have an uncaused cause for the universe to exist that is out of space and time. God is outside space and time. Well, what created God, you ask. Nothing, because God is beyond both and not constrained by either.

...Please consider the following carefully.  Prior to the Big Bang, there was no past, present, or future.  All Every and Every All was Eternal.  When a portion of Eternal was torn apart, and set aside.  The result was huge amounts of all that held Eternal together was released.  The result was the very first moment of Time/Space created.  GOD separated a portion of Eternity, Heaven, and set aside for HIMSELF HIS Garden.  The Garden included All Every and Every All in the Garden which began the very first moments of Time, in the Space of HIS Garden.  One other thought.

Sorry for the typos.
Validated,  electrons neutrons and photons, the family of gamma ray particles in x-ray particles word discovered to be spinning rings of energy with 137 flat sides that remain in the Constance of the velocity of the  speed of light. The gamma ray in x-ray particles are high-energy particles in this explains the background radiation because they have a longer observational limitation relative to the photons. Existence is infinite,  it is just IS !!!
This new view comes from an engineer physicist Russell Stewart Hall, rings of reality analytic metaphysics. Here&#39;s what was validated, all energy Mass gravity has existed forever, equilibrium cause and effect in any body mass only has organizational effect on a equilibrium or less amount of mass, gravity is the simplest and weakest force of nature it is nothing more than changing the shape of the space of two  different densities. Existence is a complete environment of mass. Photons are particles in the form of a smoke ring that have 137 flat sides and they lose energy by expansion with distance absorption and reflection. This accidental Discovery completely destroys wave theory and offers a much more rational obvious logical simple understanding of our universe.
There is a new view of the cosmos of cycling nature that came from an accidental discovery not through Theory. This view has been validated to 99999 quintillion against the periodic table elements gravity in time. This new discovery explains why we cannot measure the mass of a photon it has complete explanation in the most simplest understandings of the fundamental nature of existence itself

The idea of a cyclical universe was popular in antiquity. Many Greek philosophers propounded this idea. It was particularly common in stoic philosophy. The idea fell out of favor however with the advent of Christianity. Writing in 400 CE, St. Augustine argued that if the universe were cyclical, Christ would have to die an infinite number of times in cycle after cycle. The Idea was then abandoned in the west for centuries. It reemerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, perhaps most notably in the works of Fredrick Nietzsche. This idea of a cyclical universe is commonly call eternal return.
Do you know what this means if scientists are right about this? It means that your life will be relived in the same succession and sequence an infinite number of times.
interesting. I need to re watch so I can better understand, but their idea does make sense.
I was once asked by a student for advice on how he should live his life. I replied that I could not give him a definitive answer. If I did, he would be living by some other person‚Äôs design. ‚ÄúBut perhaps I can give you a gift. Maybe I can give you a thought.‚Äù I said, and then I gave him a thought, I borrowed from Nietzsche. ‚ÄúWhat if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness, and say to you, &quot;This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence&quot; ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: &quot;You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.&quot; - The Gay Science. The student was a little confused at first. He asked some questions, finally he understood.

I am sorry, I did not think this was very well explained.  I had trouble understanding exactly what was being postulated.  There seemed to be a lot of general hand waving about the philosophy but not enough about the nature of the simulation. I think Brian was trying to extract the essence of what was being done but was not successful.  Putting wavy things on the screen, not clearly explaining what we were looking at and not explaining how they were derived was unhelpful.  So my take away was, there maybe a cyclic alternative to cosmic inflation, however, so far not very convincing.

Two giant flattened black holes spinning in opposite directions cycling all the matter through a giant magnetar field that lies between them cycles all matter through its phases.

Hindu mythology describes the universe as cyclic, with creation, preservation, and destruction repeating in infinite cycles. This concept is known as &quot;Yugas.&quot; Brahma is the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer. The universe is believed to be a manifestation of the cosmic dance of Lord Shiva, known as the Tandava. Hindu cosmology also includes the concept of multiple realms or Lokas, each serving a specific purpose in the cosmic order.
can we say, smooth and flat due to entanglement?
I don&#39;t understand what gave anyone the idea the universe could contract?
Why couldn&#39;t the big bang have begun as a single photon with energy E = hf = energy of the big bang? Would that explain the homogeneity of the universe?
The more we find out about the Universe, the more we know about how much we do not know about it. Thanks to observation tools like JWST we are certainly started realizing how incomplete is our current knowledge of the Universe.
Sort of. Most of what we find supports what we already know. The things we see that we can&#39;t explain, already couldn&#39;t be explained, or we know that our explanations are only placeholders. It was hoped the &quot;crisis in cosmology&quot; might be solved, and it hasn&#39;t been (its only gotten worse with more accurate observations!) but that already existed before JWST.
When matter gets too heavy it falls out of the universe turns back into energy and time equals zero.    The whole thing is controlled by cats.
Elon Musk was the beginning. :))
they didn&#39;t explain connections between entropy and gravity, where matter including DM come from? what is observation/measurement and who/what can be regarded as the observer of the universe?  we see the universe from the very special position in the center of the observable universe while they are trying to insist that there is nothing special in life according to this model. entropy and complexity are very important and deeply interconnected notions which are out of this consideration. sorry.
There is nothing special about our observational position in the universe. All locations in the universe see the same sort of limited view extending out to the age time of the last bounce (or big bang). there is no center point. As far as we know, the universe can be infinite.
A comment meant for this video was mistakenly Posted on another one by same presenter, but on Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>In a nutshell, I posited that the cyclic models of the universe,  especially so by Sir Roger Penrose, are garnering the much needed consensus, unanimity and support.<br><br>I agree with this model as it is in harmony with my YouTube video that attempted to unravel reality in the universe.<br><br>I posited that in the universe, matter is always interacting with light to produce non-mattet moeties (dark matter) which subsequently loose this quanta (dark energy) to revert to matter and process repeats endlessly in a relation that is at equilibrium; thereby defining reality to simultaneously consist of matter (that is macroscopic, classical, physical, visible) and non-matter (that is microscopic, invisible and in quantum state). This model of reality providing for the possibility of retrocausality in the universe as model is also consistent with the particle/wave duality of nature observed by de Broglie and also addressing concerns by Einstein and others that the quantum theory might be incomplete in describing nature in the universe. This faster than light speed of conversion from classical to quantum states and vice versa brings on board condensed matter physics that mesmerizes observers, causing what is perceived as the measurement problem; accounting for misconceptions associated with the wave-function  collapse when we look and even assertions that the moon might not be there when we are not looking. Luckily, attosecond techniques might now shed better light on what is real in the universe.üéâ<br><br>The only thing these new modeling needs to re-check is that contraction is slow. I have posited in unraveling reality in the universe that the two processes of contraction due to gravitational pull and expansion due to gravitational/quantum push (dark/fifth force) are at equilibrium and proceed at a speed faster than light, though I might be wrong.

I think the Universe is dynamic &amp; animated, &amp; pulses like a wave, producing a series of Big Bangs like a celestial sausage machine.  There is no beginning and no end, except for the birth of consciousness which was needed to give meaning to all material existence.
Needed by us, maybe. But why would a human invention like meaning be needed for a physical process?
I just love science programs like these. Hypothesis are postulated and then discussed until there is nothing left but facts close to  be 100% true.

The singular big bang theory is a fairy tale for various reasons.  The CMBR from the supposed big bang should be long gone by now and should not even be able to be seen by us, and red shift observations have a more &#39;normal&#39; already known physics explanation, no dark energy nor dark matter needed.
SINGULAR BIG BANG THEORY (FAIRY TALE):<br><br>Okay, for those who believe that the singular big bang theory is really true and that all the energy and matter in this universe came from a very dense singularity:  Please also honestly and accurately answer:<br><br>1.  Where did the singularity come from or did it eternally exist throughout all of eternity past?<br>2.  Where did the 1 iota of energy come from to trigger the singularity to &#39;bang&#39; one day in eternity?<br>3.  What forces of nature existed to allow the singularity to exist and to &#39;bang&#39;?<br>4.  What forces of nature allowed our current forces of nature to come into existence?<br>5.  What exactly is &#39;space&#39; and how exactly does space expand?<br>6.  What exactly is &#39;time&#39; and how exactly does time vary?<br>7.  What exactly is &#39;gravity&#39; and how exactly does gravity do what gravity does in this universe?<br>8.  How exactly do numbers and mathematical constants exist in the universe for math to do what math does in this universe?<br>9.  RED SHIFT:  Consider the following:  Modern science claims that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it&#39;s one of the foundations of physics.  &#39;IF&#39; a photon red shifts, where does the energy from the red shifted photon go?  And what makes that energy leave the photon?<br>10.  CMBR from a singular big bang should be long gone by now and should not even be able to be seen by us.<br>11.  There are other more &#39;normal&#39; physical explanations for the &#39;red shift&#39; observations.
It was the beginning of the end.
Well if the Big Bang you refer to was the beginning of this material realm, then yes it was also the beginning of Space and Time. But it was not the beginning whatsoever, for there was a realm that existed always and forever, and it is not part of the material realm like this earth or our universe. Within the spiritual realm you do not need anything, let alone space or time, not even light as you know it.
feels like multiverse, but in time instead of space

I&#39;m deeply disappointed. How could you discuss cyclic cosmology and not include Penrose&#39;s theory? It does not call for a contraction and requires no inflation and explains the maximum entropy seen in the CMB (yes, maximum, from which it cannot grow any more).<br><br>But I am most disappointed, and feel cheated, by the title of the video. It discusses nothing about time, other than erroneously saying that all religions want a moment of creation when all they want is creation; the moment part added by scientists. What is true is that Christianity does require linear time with a pre and post Christ eras clearly demarcated.<br><br>Time is, in its essence, cyclical and not linear. Once Physics begins to understand that, Cosmology will find its right path. And, by the way, CCC (Penrose&#39;s theory) fits better with cyclical time than a bouncing universe.<br><br>I appreciate putting yet another nail in the cosmic inflation coffin. One of these days you will do the same to String Theory, Brian.
Guests say nothing. Shame.
The Universe is a toroid and the big bang is the central point in the spiral vortex,,, we are riding the surface on the way out and will eventually come full circle and colapse back into the center,  Rinse and repeat,
The Big Bang model is religion.
interesting how he jumps to Hubble without mentioning the scientist/theologian Georges Lemaitre, who Einstein once criticized to his face for first theorizing the big bang then later apologized, even before Edwin Hubble came into the picture.  These cosmologists cower away from any spiritual scientists as though they were vampires.
Time is a compactified dimension one single Planck second in size. <br>This is why there are limits <br>This is why there is conservation<br><br>And neutron decay cosmology closed that loop only one Planck second long
I think that the big bang is explained incorrectly. I don&#39;t think the big bang is observable in this physical reality. Even through we can see the effects of it. I think time is &quot;bleeding&quot; matter allowing for a stationary pattern of infinate possibilities in an instant.
Refute the 1.0 experiment and I&#39;ll believe you everything you want. By the way, Einstein wasn&#39;t the only one who believed in a static universe.

My only question to esteemed panelists is--If speed of light is constant in vacuum then is that vacuum devoid of space and if scientists actually created vacuum devoid of space for experiments then what space is made up of? The answer is simple-time doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s no arrow of time as such rather there&#39;s only arrow of entropy which spreads at lightspeed and even slows down if we travel at higher speeds and there&#39;s simply no time or time dilation or time dimension as such. There are only spatial dimensions.
No vacuum is devoid of space . Without space the vacuum would not exist . The vacuum is based on the physical dynamics . <br>And Space can not be grasped a hold of by vacuum .
There are only spacial dimensions . Therefore physical dimensions   Time is irrelevant to these spacial dimensions and physical dimensions . Both would exist without time included .
Vacuum has space .

It may be helpful to consider that the universe INCLUDES a 4th SPATIAL dimensions that we cannot interact with (being the 3D creatures that we are). It would solve a lot of these questions as well as many problems with the big bang theory. Dark matter and dark energy could be solved by that, too.
A 4th spatial dimension is only a hypothetical construct to move our 3 dimensions inside. It‚Äôs done in programming for example. You can use even more mathematical dimensions to create more efficient storage systems. We also have string theory and quantum loop hypothesis that includes over 10 dimensions. <br><br>The problem isn‚Äôt really a lack of invoking dimensions.

I propose mini big bangs. When black holes go critical because they grow so large they split their atoms and in the process lose their gravitational attraction. Could you imagine what would happen then!
Might it be that expansion and contraction are both present together, working in tandem? Galaxies can be expanding as a whole, while within each galaxy pockets of contraction might provide the smoothing until an equilibrium is obtain?
No, since the smoothing is on a cosmic scale, what&#39;s happening in galaxies wouldn&#39;t account for it.

From many Galactic perspectives its not . <br><br>The Universe is static . Einstein is correct .
To make a long story short, what did the Big Bang push against for it to be able to expand in only one direction?
No Expert but my understanding is that space is expanding in all directions and a cross-Section is being depicted as spheres would be a messy view. Sometimes you see a circle with CMB very close to the circle and we are in the center.
‚Äã@@jayanderson66No matter where you are in the universe the CMB would look like a bubble centred around you. It was a point in time when the universe became transparent, and it did so all at once everywhere. So how far away it looks is based on how long ago it happened (since you see further back in time the farther away you look). It was an event in time, not in space, and therefore appears equidistant in all directions.
The direction is &quot;out&quot;. That&#39;s like asking what a balloon is pressing against when it expands outward. Imagine you&#39;re a bacteria on the surface of a ballon. You&#39;re just holding still in that one spot. Another bacteria is sitting still a few inches away and you&#39;re looking at them through a little bacteria-size telescope. As the balloon inflates, it looks like they&#39;re traveling away from you even though you&#39;re both staying still on your patch of balloon. That&#39;s what the universe expanding is like to us when we look at distant galaxies.
Where is the festival
One of the things that I have never been able to understand about the Big Bang is what gave it its cone-shaped directionality? It is almost as though it happened in a manner analogous to a shaped-charge plastic explosive that is designed to follow the path of least resistance created by a secure and durable jacket lying in the direction opposite to the desired explosive path. It reminds me of the Egyptian creator-god Atum who, having surfaced from within Nun, the primordial deep, found himself without a place upon which to stand and proceed with the creation of everything that would subsequently exist. He therefore had to dogpaddle until the Primeval Mound rose up under him so that he had a place upon which to stand and work. Perhaps someone with greater understanding of these matters than I possess can explain it in simple enough terms that a layperson such as I can understand.
It didn&#39;t expand in a cone, that image is just an illustration of the Universe getting bigger over time. As you go to the right, you&#39;re seeing the universe getting older. It&#39;s like if you graphed your height over time from when you were an egg on the left to your present hight at the right. That graph would be a cone shape, yet would not mean you, yourself, are cone-shaped.
The big bang is an idea. We don&#39;t know because we can&#39;t ever see our whole universe. From what we know now it&#39;s possible that the universe is still being created and always has been in this state somewhere. We don&#39;t have any idea how large the universe is outside of what we can possibly perceive in the observable universe. The universe may be filled with white holes that we can&#39;t perceive. Maybe the vacuum of space itself is a white hole/holes.
I do not see how this explains the CMB which looks like very solid evidence of expansion.
‚Äã@@jayanderson66They were saying in the video that the CMB could represent a local area of expansion that&#39;s at least as big as the observable universe. But the entire universe far beyond what we can see may be doing a mix of contacting and expanding. We might just be in one little bubble in this whole big milkshake!
I like listening to smart people.

Gravitational lenses are key to seeing the gravitational fluid and how laminar flowing depleted fluid interacting with background replacement fluid flowing in. If it is matter, these clusters would be moving around for billions of years within an 80% of the 80% gravitational dark matter egg shell, these galaxies would lose all their dark matter shell and much of their matter to the trench of the egg shell, we do not see odd galaxies and matter in the lenses. With 2 colliding clusters there is turbulence of collision the conditions are not right for sanding waves, yet outside the collision the partial standing waves still exist in the calm conditions, also the 80% or the 80% are not showing itself in the colliding matter. It is non-interactive so it would not join the chaos and would wag the tail of visible matter as it continues on its pre-collision path. The warping of the gravitational fluid at the interface shows there is resistance to the flow of new fluid matter needs to continue warping space time and having gravity. Gravitation also may slow down from light speed as it approaches background levels and get sluggish, this can cause much of the warping never getting out of the center of the universe crating a very deep and attractive gravitational well over 100s of billions of years, everything would slide into the center and create the universe sized black hole. The outflowing and inflowing of gravitational fluid would get backed up, it would create gravitational pressure, it would probably reduce the gravity of the starved core of the black hole, it would overload and create the big bang.

There is only one answer........God
Well yes, but then no. And thirdly, that&#39;s not really an answer. It may be the ultimate cause, but it would be silly to think God made the universe with magic. Mathematics is a real thing. Humans discovered it. We did not invent it. Math reveals the nature of our reality. So it is a fundamental aspect of our universe and was probably used in the formation. If God created the sciences and used them to create our universe, then we can use them to figure out <i>how</i> God created it. So science is ultimately the study of God, if you&#39;re a spiritual person. Just saying the answer is God, however, is no answer at all. That&#39;s like saying energy = Einstein.  Well yes,  but then no.
If climatologists thought the same way‚Ä¶
what they fail discuss is the causal mechanism for the expanding universe (currently reported with a large time lag) to reverse to a contracting universe in the observable space.  Otherwise an excellent presentation.
I think cycles emerge from the revolutions of planets. If you were in an area of space with no stars or black holes and lived in a controlled environment then what cycles permeate our existence currently might not propagate themselves in the same way. Maybe if we weren‚Äôt in constant motion, then our understandings of time and how it cycles might not be the same except we could set a counter clock to maintain an understanding or position in time. But without motion does time still flow the same?
Everything you&#39;re saying is extremely well known and accounted for. Cycles of the Universe could have nothing to do with our planetary system, which is an infinitesimally small spec in the grand scale of the Universe and in time. It would be like saying that stirring your tea this morning is what caused ocean currents that involve trillions of times more energy and mass and have been going on for billions more years than your teacup has existed.

The Big Bang, the Big Crunch? The Big Crunch throws out the Hubble Constant of expansion because you cannot have a &quot;Constant&quot; beyond the rate of acceleration of an expanding universe much less an acceleration rate approaching the speed of light, where such a rate cannot be observable. The known visible edge of the universe is just that, the edge of space that has already expanded beyond the visible edge. If one placed the center of a circle at the edge of the universe, earth would be on the edge of the visible universe from the perspective of the center of that circle. If the rate of acceleration increases the constant of expansion then it would be the Great Attractor (Laniakea) that is accelerating the expansion, being there are two halves of the Great Attractor; this might only be where the great voids are created within (The Great Attractor) a slightly bent tube between entry and exit halved points of massive volumes of galactic clusters, as the Great Attractor shapes those voids. Within the visible universe, beyond which spatial structures like the Great Attractor, there may be interconnected structures with similar dynamo shapes of the Great Attractor which could bee separate universes.  For now we can safely assume that a given amount of spacetime has expanded and accelerated beyond the visible edge of the universe. This must be true in all directions, even being flung out from our center in the Milky Way that future expansion of space is occurring. Black Holes do not have White Holes, but they do have a Dark Side of the Moon, it is not a hole in spacetime. There is no other side of a black hole. Gravity is influenced in all directions so a black hole would have craters on its dark side. Only its spin and magnetic influence creates the accretion disk around a super dense solid or plasma object. A black hole may be an anti-matter factory annihilating light, its accretion disk super colliding the particles at constant energies which can produce anti-matter, the point at which light and matter is destroyed. If space is expanding and collapsing then it is doing so through both halves of the Great Attractor. It would take the age of the universe to create one void. The other simplified item is that we are seeing expansion as a result of the strands or gravitational filamentary threads of galactic clustering and matter in relation to each other or eventual merging filaments.

I missed the latest findings of the Webb telescope. I wonder why it was completely ignored. I had to double check but the event took place only yesterday. So, you could hac]ve really had the latest data
The idea than science done 100 years ago is new science strikes me of being somewhat arrogant. Many of us question what has really been accomplished by Stringers in the past 50 years and whether something other than a bigger LHC might be a wiser investment.
So from a religious stand point, where does that leave the chance that the Bible is true and that God created everything and Christianity in and of itself is a viable option for how we all came to be? I think that should be part of everyone of these but they never talk about what  implications these theorys could potentially have for the religious minded type, given that one believes that God or some Creator created everything?
There are bigger problems with religions like Christianity that go far beyond a cyclical universe or evolution by natural selection. Those are the popular ones because they are relatively easy issues that anyone could see as threats to the authority of the Bible. If you really want to challenge your faith, I suggest studying anthropology and history (not &quot;biblical history,&quot; told from the perspective of biblical scholars). It&#39;s pretty obvious to any deep thinker that these religions arose and evolved to meet the needs of certain groups of people.<br><br>For example, it&#39;s no surprise that the animistic beliefs of tribal society differ fundamentally from the organized religions of civilization. Organized religion is spirituality hijacked by ruling elites to placate the masses and make them subservient to a concentrated, localized power. The more desperate the masses become, the more they dream of some sort of &quot;salvation.&quot; So religions provide that in return for dedication and hard work.<br><br>And just this example has serious repercussions for us today. In the culture wars that are tearing countries apart, the religious conservatives that dominate the far right consciously or unconsciously desire a return to &quot;rule by divine right.&quot; That goes by back to the Enlightenment and the birth of civilized democracy -- the initial schism that created today&#39;s culture wars. So if you want to understand the world today, including your religion, you need to understand history, not cosmology.
These people are scientists, not philosophers. It isn&#39;t their job to discuss God in relation to science. There are a few physicists who take on those philosophical issues, and they really are among my favorite. They tend to see much bigger than the Bible amd Christianity though. The Bible isn&#39;t a science book, so there is no way to discuss it in scientific terms. Christianity is about faith, not about scientific discovery.
The mainline cosmological view pretends that the steadfast (average joe) shares the same philosophy as boomer scientists which is unlikely considering the simplified description of what boomer scientists actually do. The real motive is job retention.

Just another gooblti-goop religion
The BB was the beginning of our visible universe that we call home but it was hardly the beginning. We‚Äôre just one atom inside other atoms n universes.
I think that the Big Bang theory is unconvincing and weak. There is a reason or reasons that we have not yet realized for the existence of the universe
Our problem with understanding the universe is that there are many questions and the answers to these questions are few and unconvincing
Entire &quot;spacial content&quot;, E, moves(propagates) with, constant, light-speed, C, C=E, &amp; in &quot;relative interactive situations from &quot;zero-events through Constant ,C, 0~C, parameters; -1=C=E/0~C=+1, as nature, equation...!....--Liz&amp;val.(c)2023
It was one of many..
A cyclic universe is easier to accept rather than a beginning. It‚Äôs similar to accepting the idea of infinite space rather than an end in space.
Yes, unless we simply cannot yet understand a &quot; beginning &quot; or &quot;physical end&quot; of spacetime...as we cannot fathom a 4th spatial dimension
Be careful not to accept one idea over another just because it feels good. Always follow the evidence.
Brian concerning the simulations Paul refers to around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=3960">1:06:00</a> min into video the simulation shrinking is going back in time :you get more order.  Expansion brings time forward more mess. Simulation reflects reality. Yes?
This discussion contains many profound ideas with some usually hidden ones presented openly that are not limited to a &#39;cyclic cosmology&#39;.  For example, is a simulation based on a &#39;solid model&#39;, i.e. GR, what are the initial conditions used, i.e. spatial shear and is there an arbitrary &#39;sense&#39; to it all  These topics enter the discussion about one hour into the video lead with good questions by Dr. Greene.  I, for one, would love to hear/see what Roger Penrose, Neil Turok and Jim Peebles have as reactions to this work.
I hope they weigh in on this idea as well. I&#39;ve been looking for reactions but haven&#39;t found them.

No.  It was not the beginning.  This is speculative gibberish.  <br><br>No one knows how, when and why we are here.  Trying to understand the universe by taking pictures of distant objects is a futile activity.  It does not answer our questions and this expensive hobby diverts our attention from what is important.  Which is, getting along with each other and taking care of others. At the end of the day, the cold, violent, and indifferent universe has made it clear that all we really have is each other.
We are a spec in the universe. We can never know how big the universe is or its roots. God created everything. There is probably another earth out there on the other end of the universe with people believing they are the only ones.üòÇ Our technology can never figure out the greatness of God.
The big bang theory is nothing more than some man&#39;s version of what they think happened..... there&#39;s no such thing as a beginning in infinity but people are stupid and view every aspect of their lives like its a movie with a beginning and an end when really what has always been will always be time is a human construct
Is it really so ridiculous to think that the physics we learn before the first grade do not apply to the Universe as a whole...<br>Such as in the case of multiverse, the effects sitting on a waterbed mattress might explain dark matter and dark energy?
There&#39;s no time in space, thank you for proving my point, we should celebrate every day that we are at least unique in our Galaxy and have the consciousness to think about it
Because, the Big Bang is so obviously illogical and un scientific. A fairy tale silly story. Supposedly made up by <br> &#39;&#39;professing expert scientists&quot;. Won&#39;t back away from stupidity, so add to it. Contracting and expanding bang bang bang for eternity. OK.<br>Smoke and mirrors and diversions with absolutely no proof that these learned ones havwe a single brain cell between them. Who says that they are intelligent  ? They do. They are experts, right ? OK.<br>Does not matter. No matter. The original Q? remains.<br>What can supplant creationism ? &#39;Cause, IF created, then there must be a  . . . . .?
Any theory that needs revision with each new piece of data or observation has no predictive value and is therefore of no use. It is also good evidence that the theory is not aligned with reality.<br><br>This was the central problem with Ptolemy&#39;s epicycles. With each new observation, Ptolemy had to reconstruct (post hoc) his maths with additional artifacts to explain the new data. It could make general short-term predictions, but it could never accurately predict the orbits of the planets to match future observations for decades or centuries ahead.<br><br>In the same regard, the Big Bang Theory (BBT) has never made a correct prediction &quot;prior&quot; to the observation. For example the CMB was originally predicted by BBT proponents to be 20 kelvin, but it turned out to be just 3 kelvin, in energy terms about 10 orders of magnitude lower, and thus the BBT was then adjusted (post hoc) to match.¬† Lately the BBT has failed to predict the existance of extremely long lived second generation stars such as the 14.6byo Methusela star, large black holes of impossibly high (for the BBT) masses of over 10 billion suns, and the James Webb discoveries of large established galaxies at high redshift.¬† Of course, justifications and theory tweeks aplenty arrive &quot;post hoc&quot; but Hindsight does not a correct prediction make!<br><br>The second indication of a failed theory is its reliance on unproven assumptions. Ptolemy&#39;s Epicycles were based on the assumption that the earth was the centre of the universe around which everything else revolved. Now known to be false, of course.¬†<br><br>Similarly, the BBT relies on the assumption that red-shift equals velocity. A direct measurement of galactic velocity has never been made (very difficult at such distances of course) to confirm this, but that does not stop the entire science community from ignoring this assumption and claiming as fact that distant galaxies are receeding rapidly. Note that Sir Edwin Hubble (discoverer of the red-shift vs. distance relationship) never made this mistake.<br><br>Other indications that a theory is not aligned with reality is its complexity and required inclusion of undetected &amp; unobserved artifacts that &quot;just have to be&quot; for the theory to work. Over time, Ptolemy&#39;s theory incorporated such mathematical artifacts as deferents, epicycles, eccentrics, and equants. None of which has ever been found to correlate to anything existing in reality, of course.<br><br>For complex theories, the BBT takes the cake. It requires the existance of many magical artifacts which have never been detected in any laboritory, such as; dark matter, dark energy, inflation field, proton decay, matter anti-matter asymetry, expanding space, homogenious &amp; isotropic space (it isn&#39;t), violation of the speed of light, violation of the conservation of energy and violation of cause &amp; effect (the something from nothing connundrum), oh, and special magical space where even the mass of the entire universe was somehow still not enough to create a black hole in the begining and stop the whole thing from expanding instantly, ..... just to name a few of its problems.<br><br>Thus, the Big Bang Theory is well and truly dead.  Only the human failings of: &quot;jumping on the bandwagon&quot; and false logic of  &quot;appeals to authority&quot; are what keep this religion alive.  Oh, how I wish scientists would actually apply scientific thinking.üò¢<br><br>Appologies for the long post.üòä
We&#39;re just debris dropped in the ocean of space binding and floating our way thru time. Yes I just smoked
also, if we run with this Einsteinian dream that all relations are self defining in a sense, the size of the universe changing isn&#39;t actually what expansion means, expansion in that sense means the changing of relations inside the space. in that language the notion of a singularity just doesn&#39;t exist anymore or it changes into a different kind of statement which can just as easily have a past as any other point or volume.
with respect to this comment i just made, pauls point makes a lot of sense, but i think it is a mix, i think he thought he had some notion of self consistency baked in and the observations carried it, little did he know that to explain the broken scale in variance in the physics of atoms in the same language as curved spacetime you need the universe to expand, it turns out it cannot bounce outside very spacial cases that are ultimately local fluctuations and shouldn&#39;t really be viewed as contraction, it could never happen for a large universe like ours, but essentially the mechanisms you need to explain the broken scale invariance of matter and a lot of other feature of the forces you absolutely need expansion in the context of this ever increasing entropy to explain features that look driven and damped in equal propotions in relation to a moving definition of energy related to the broken scale invariance. but he could never have known that something as simple as self consistency could tie all these things together, and that is the curse of being a pioneer, you never know what might come next, and so we shouldn&#39;t take our principles so seriously outside understanding their application and intent in a separated way.
to me the question of a beginning or no beginning has nothing to do with religion in gr, it has to do with entropy an recurrence. there is absolutley no justification for making an entropy argument going back to an initial time based on first principles, thats just a maximum, and if you have a pure state in some sense it could just bounce in all sorts of randomized ways infinitley into the past, there is no notion of an absolute second law in such a picture with true equilibria, which are statistical concepts which doesnt necessarily apply as such. if you want a universe that is eternal in both directions it either has a well defined arrow of time or it doesnt, many roads lead to rome and many dont. the reason to doubt a beginning doesnt have to do with religion or entropy, both can accomodate both fininte time and infinite time, but self consistency, if the laws are relational a past or future singularity makes absolutley no sense form the point of view of the type of self consistency einstein would upon reflection agree to be completely relational, that is to say relativistic not only with respect to motions, but with respect to all relations and quantities. in such a universe a singularity is non sensical, i think that is the motivation, not something else in the deepest part of the desire. i am also one to want that type of self consistency, but just because it is possible to imagine, along with all the singular theories, i think it is likley true, because the theory doesnt need to wave its hands as much. getting into the reasons in detail is perhaps better left to a proper paper, but if you add to it a self consistency mechanism that also produces an eternal arrow of time, such the no equalibrium truly exists, there is always a ball rolling down a hill in some sense for aspects of every system, then you get rid of all the problems at once, and luckily this kind of idea is fruitful in the sense that it fits all the features you need to explain what we have observed so far, there isnt a single thing that has been surprising the last 300 years that isnt required to meet such a consistency criteria, that is why it is appealing , it is the only principle from an armchair that seems to work.
conceptual curve fitting just means something like finding laws that take some physical variable as an input to a function, while numerical is more like the cosmological constant, we should however be careful about the principles behind both, and even if the cosmological constant has a straight forward interpretation on the other side of the equation it isn&#39;t necessarily as easy as equating it to an energy density. this goes back to my prior comments, it might take some time but i will show you exactly what i mean in due time.
there are reasons why this leads to layers of abstraction, that is necessary to do cosmology in some for or fashion, and it turns into half and half conceptual and numerical curve fitting, which is not an insult btw, this is what we have been stuck with in part since newton, but this kind of physics model is always open to changing principles, and so we shall see. this is not to say that the work already done on cosmology is wrong, or unimportant, it might just take a more complicated and constraining set of principles to make progress.
you see it depends on the coordinate interpretations, because at a certain expansion rate the rate of change in the energy density can also be corresponding in a funky way, but this only makes good physical sense for these types of equations when you define energy in a certain way, and this business has to do with derivatives of the metric and so on and the energy densities even when they are 0 and so it isn&#39;t as un-tricky as either Einstein or his contemporaries knew anything about, the essential boiled down version is that you can pick a convention and it will sort out your derivatives independently of what the energy densities actually are without changing the equations so to speak in this more involved language, so in a sense they where both right and wrong. this is the gist anyway :)
There was no big bang that can actually be provin cause no human was present‚ÄΩ Maybe there was a bunch of small bangs‚ÄΩ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We have accumulated quite a bit of knowledge/experience in the past 300 years... We&#39;ve accumulated quite a bit of fairy tales as well and some are actually like the big bang, unproven hearsay! One thing is a for sure; our Sun makes it a present without it no one would be saying anything! üåûüåé
it isn&#39;t mathematically incorrect or correct to say the universe with Einsteins equation for the metric and derivatives, depending on its context, it is simply up to adding abstract redefinition on either side, either adding some term to cancel it or adding some energy density to cancel it. the physical meaning of that is basically free to be chosen, this is something that can be argued with the proper theory at a later date, but essentially, it is either or, what is more natural is basically just up to the user.

It is strange they do not mention vibration as if sound was the initial event it would have created vibrations.
This entire discussion was basically about how there weren&#39;t more/larger vibrations in the early universe and that this lack of vibration needs an explanation. Those vibrations would have manifested as hot and cool spots, dense and less dense areas in the CMB. There are certainly some, but just not nearly as much as one might expect. In the early universe everything was packed together so much it was like a fluid that could conduct vibrations through it. At the time the CMB was generated the universe became too thin to conduct vibrations any more, but their signature would have been captured in the CMB and are now amplified by gravity as matter clusters into the cosmic web, which started out as the dense areas in that early vibration. The spaces that are opening up in between the filaments of this web were the rarified areas of the vibration. But yeah, the whole talk is on just how minute and tiny these vibrations were, basically, just not actually using the word &quot;vibration&quot; specifically. Hope I explained that well enough!

Old massive, fully grown galaxies further than 13.5 billion light-years away was predicted in the paperback book I wrote called *SECRET UNIVERSE: GRAVITY by Ron Kemp*.  The book breaks down the evolutionary model, the big bang, cosmic inflation, gravity, laws of thermodynamics and motion, equations of relativity and explains why they are incomplete, how to fix them and the predictions the revisions make.  I won&#39;t spoil it for you but on page 48 I wrote quote, &quot;The JWST, James Webb Space Telescope will discover old, fully grown galaxies as far as the telescope can see, further than 13.8 billion light-years away.&quot;  The book was published 09-27-2021, almost 3 months before the JWST was launched and almost a year before the JWST data confirmed everything.  Maybe astronomers and astrophysicists should be listening to me, seeing how I accurately predicted them in the distant &quot;early&quot; universe?

The Big Bang Theory - that 13.7 billion years ago there was nothing - then a big explosion happened, is the most ridiculous idea mankind has ever had. You don&#39;t need years of scientific training to see the stupidity of it. If there was NOTHING 13.75 billion years ago then there was nothing to explode. If there was an explosion 13.75 billion years ago then there was already something there to explode - hence there was something existing already, which means it couldn&#39;t be the beginning. The universe can only be infinite and eternal.

It is impossible to get something from nothing. Look at my bank account. Or Joe Biden. To think that our universe suddenly sprang from nothing is ludicrous.
Joe Biden? What does that even mean? Biden is an accomplished attorney, he was a US senator for decades and is now the president of the Inited States. I guarantee you are not as accomplished. Not. Even. Close. Maybe it makes you feel better about yourself to imagine otherwise.
The competing cosmological models are pretty dependent on principles. What if the universe&#39;s minimum a(t) never was microscopic due to space requirements of its total energy content (then of an extremely nonlinear, selfinteracting system)? And time, whatever this is in the spatial bottleneck situation, could it have slowed down enough to guarantee sort of thermodynamic equilibrium to be reached without any inflationary necessity? And kind of a Feigenbaum scenario with a plethora of phase transitions would then have had the time necessary to evolve and generate complexity...
All pre first seconds after the big bang claims is not science but speculation.
that lady lid up the stage
So fascinating and inspiring.
Beginning and the end of the universe of space and time are matters of speculation not backed by logic, maths and science. The reality of evolution of life and consciousness is the result of millions/billions of lotteries won in a row over millions/billions of years, evolving out of complexity, the algorithm isn&#39;t known at all. Humans wish the answer is simple, but it isn&#39;t. In fact humans will never know the secret.

‚Äã@@macysondheimWhat will you be ?
how did they get to be the same temperature? gravity on the PODE. the PODE itself would be extremely close to uniform and the mechanism that actually made the big bang expand is still not yet understood. so that could also play a part.
It annoys the crap out of me when lazy scientists and yes I said lazy just put their foot down and say that nothing happened before the big bang because there is no before because that is when time itself started.  Bull crap.  There is always a before even if we don&#39;t know what it was.  I say its lazy because once you make that declaration you no longer have to even think about what might have happened before, its a cop out.
You can&#39;t do scientific experiments on anything that would have preceeded the big bang (assuming the big bang is valid). So scientists aren&#39;t being lazy, lol. There&#39;s simply no science possible before the <i>creation</i> of the universe. We don&#39;t have the ability to see beyond our very creation.
Fantastic.Thank you so much for organising this festival, and for its live broadcadting. I have found this conversation particularly interesting.

&quot;... observations by Edwin Hubble revealed that the fabric of space is expanding ...&quot; Is gravitational energy conserved?

Big bang is bull crap
If considering entropy as a law is correct, then entropy follows a certain order (message). Furthermore, there is no such thing as chaos, just rearranging to a new order...which also does not follow the idea behind entropy. If entropy was a law, we wouldn&#39;t be here. The idea is flawed.

Still on the Big Bang?  They need to revisit the &quot;Stasis&quot; model.  It explains things a lot better than BBT.  No, the observations don&#39;t match 100%, nor does the BBT.  James Webb has debunked The Big Bang.

Beams of material energy could fill the early universe, making it hot somewhat smoothly. It is logical more than hypothetical cosmic inflation theory.
Dark Energy is a product of Black Holes, and the expansion (Dark Energy) can stop if Black Holes can&#39;t absorb ordinary matter and dark matter.
This is the best news I&#39;ve had in decades! According to the standard Big Bang cosmology we&#39;ve all been taught, the entire parade of existence, with the possibility of human consciousness, is just a great, big, beautiful one night stand, never to be repeated. However, if our panel is speaking truth, then we, like Jim Carrey, may yet tell the Universe, &quot;So you&#39;re saying, there&#39;s a chance...&quot;
Don&#39;t get too worked up. The universe may go on forever, but we don&#39;t.
@@donnievance1942 , actually, it just pleases me to think life will arise again, whatever happens to us. In fact, if the Universe does go on forever, it is mathematically provable that life WILL arise again.
But I don&#39;t understand that if every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and if there is a great chain of causation at play or the flow of atoms, what is the cause that makes the constant expansion of the universe then start to contract all the sudden, and once there is a big crunch, start to expand once more with the big bang?

If your going to look at big bounce. Then look into Q.M. pair production and boltzmann time bombs using the universe as a natural cutoff regime. <br><br>T=0 could have happened a few ways. Q.F.T. boundary layers and superluminal propigation out. Cherenkov radiation through censorship boundary layers out to 12.5 light years diamiter flash over. Another version superfluidity neutrino and particle foliation/sheaves in given energy density regimes. C.M.B. mapping to 12.5 light year diamiter. Then particle field mapping and H0 and B.A.O.. From nuclear weapons and super nova. Burn rates and % left over. Big bang is 100% burn rate as a censorship layer. The theory of double bang supernova needs to be worked out. The big bang could have been double bang with one wave catching up with the other. Another version is from sheets colliding and depositing energy and the fields in a 12.5 light year diamiter. There are more models that work. No F.T.L. inflation needed. <br><br>Black hole mapping leads to Q.M killing fields in a given energy density regime. Dual mapping to big bang but reversed. C.M.B., C.N.B. ( cosmic neutrino background) as layers. For a bounce type universe you need something like Q.M. B.E.C. for photons and something like a compression wave/waves. It has some big problems. <br><br>All those leave out degenerative matter models. Island black holes and island big bang. That can&#39;t be ruled out. <br><br>Inflation was a bad bandaid for C.M.B.. T=0 should not be taboo. Pre T=0 models should be explored. Black holes need to be mapped beyond the event horizon. <br><br>Mapping right gives you. Predictability out of probability  in given energy density regimes. Which can be used on the whole universe and tested in ways. Particle production from quantum foam and gravitational waves and energy density regimes. <br><br>Things I would like to see. Use the words virtual infinity, sudo infinity, false infinity, relic infinity. Instead of true infinities for R=0 black holes and big bang. Black holes are finite systems with solutions. Finite stuff goes in and finite life span. Similar the big bang was finite. Looked at the right way it is a natural cutoff regime. Does quantum foam act as thought. The smoothness/lumpiness of space time and does it change  over energy density regimes. When teaching double slit and bell. Also teach or talk about defraction gradients and interference pattern. Crystallography and defraction patterns. Help them link things in ways. Not manyworlds, but many possible states. Rainbow double slit. Using a defraction gradient on a defraction interference pattern to map it in a way. Connecting Q.M. with classical in ways. Inflation theory was a bandaid and better theories that fit should be made or brought forward. The way they teach it now is don&#39;t question, and thats not good with other viable models out there that work and no F.T.L. needed.

A bit frustrating. I stopped at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO3w2D3uDTw&amp;t=3427">57:07</a> bc it was too frustrating to keep watching so I&#39;m stopping for now. For those who finished the whole thing, did they ever break down the concept of a contracting universe, that isn&#39;t spacially contracting? Every time I think about it it makes me genuinely angry because it&#39;s such a common hypothesis, the cyclic universe, a universe that expands spacially and then contracts into a big crunch. They mentioned that there model doesn&#39;t involve a big crunch. I really don&#39;t understand.

@@c-djinni If. But we just don&#39;t know what the universe is, what&#39;s beyond. So we just don&#39;t know. The speculation is interesting though
If considering entropy as a law is correct, then entropy follows a certain order (message). Furthermore, there is no such thing as chaos, just rearranging to a new order...which also does not follow the idea behind entropy. If entropy was a law, we wouldn&#39;t be here. The idea is flawed.

@@juliocortez5209 <br><br>Entropy is a statistical concept. It is not a force. When energy dissipates through a system, scattering molecules and bouncing them around, the new state that results is usually more disordered, not because there is a positive dynamic pushing things selectively toward disorder, but simply because the possible disordered resultant states are more numerous (by vast orders of magnitude) than ordered ones. I&#39;m not sure how this fact impacts on the discussion, but I have heard that Sir Roger Penrose&#39;s hypothetical Cyclic Conformal Cosmology model, somehow has a rationale that allows entropy to reset in each cycle of the universe.
@@c-djinni The word &quot;universe&quot; gets used in two ways. One is the &quot;absolutely everything&quot; sense that you are stating, and the other is a label for the spacetime and physical matrix that we can observe or extrapolate from our observations. This matrix has an apparently finite dimensional size, and an apparently finite history extending back to the &quot;big bang.&quot; Many people nowadays have adopted the convention of calling the second concept the &quot;universe&quot; and the first concept the &quot;cosmos.&quot; Personally, I think it should be the other way around, but I don&#39;t get to choose.

It baffles me that so many theorists consider entropy to be a fundamental feature rather than a emergent one. The laws of nature spread energy from one point to another in accordance to those laws, and there are always more things to spread energy to than to where it was previously. Also by nominating any one state in a system as being ordered you are instantly stacking the cards, as there are always more other states a system can be in over the one you have chosen. Entropy is really just a handy guide to describe how systems evolve over time in a general sense. For example: imagine a fictional fundamental force that has the property of stacking particles equidistant from one another then you could describe this effect as causing anti-entropy despite the force just doing what it does. In a similar way the laws of nature in our universe create entropy just as a consequence, emerging out of the fundamental forces just doing what they do.

No repetitions, just similarities. Constant perpetual motion of forward renewable singularities collisions as magnetic fields of mass cycling circulation patterns. Liquidity of illusionary solidity. Distance of forward momentum is redirected as closed circuits in magnetic fields. The earth&#39;s magnetic field controls electric magnetic fields of surface mass to ground towards its central point. Bonding is grounding. Magnets show the bonding power of atomic strength of force. Repulsion is the force of pressure of opposing direction flow. Magnets will try to force other magnets to synchronize flow by redirected trajectories of singularities passing through mass. The magnets will redirect towards the greater magnetic field. Our atomic structure is an open circuit alignment with the earth&#39;s magnetic field as the force of weight. Singularities are the dark energy outside of entanglement of mass as heat. Heat is singularities as atoms splitting as decay of mass. Renewable singularities of energy striking mass as sparks of electrons replacing singularities in chain reactions until resistance is overcome by open space itself. Hydrogen has the smallest occupational space and the strongest magnetic field. As mass expands, its magnetic field weakens. Resonating striking vibrations are more abundant in the other elements. Stars replenish singularities into space as force of pressure known as perpetual motion and striking the atmosphere of planets producing light, heat, and resonating waves. Singularities pass through mass in forward momentum resistance in chain reactions until resistance is overcome by open space. Electric fields are redirected trajectories of singularities as force that are trying to bond with earth&#39;s magnetic fields alignment as grounding. Resistance keeps our atomic structure inside safe because quatum magnetic fields are stronger than the earth&#39;s magnetic field. Theoretically factual probability.

Quantum Geometric Unification: A Hypothetical Framework for Unifying Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity**<br><br>---<br><br><b>*Abstract*</b><br><br>The pursuit of a unified theory that reconciles quantum mechanics with general relativity remains one of the most significant challenges in theoretical physics. This paper proposes a hypothetical framework termed **Quantum Geometric Unification (QGU)**. QGU posits that spacetime and matter emerge from a fundamental quantum geometric lattice (QGL) at the Planck scale. By treating spacetime as a discrete structure and matter as excitations within this lattice, QGU aims to provide a coherent and mathematically rigorous path toward unification. The theory incorporates elements from loop quantum gravity, spin foam models, and lattice gauge theories, offering potential explanations for unresolved issues such as singularities, the hierarchy problem, and the unification of fundamental forces.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*1. Introduction*</b><br><br>The incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity has long hindered the development of a unified physical theory. Quantum mechanics excels at describing the microscopic world, while general relativity provides a robust framework for gravitation and cosmology. However, their foundational principles are fundamentally different, leading to inconsistencies when attempts are made to merge them directly.<br><br>Various approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, including string theory and loop quantum gravity. While these theories have made significant strides, a complete and experimentally verifiable unification remains elusive. This paper introduces Quantum Geometric Unification (QGU), a hypothetical framework that seeks to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity by positing a discrete quantum geometric foundation of spacetime.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*2. Core Principles of Quantum Geometric Unification*</b><br><br><b>*2.1. Quantum Geometric Lattice (QGL)*</b><br><br>At the heart of QGU is the concept of the Quantum Geometric Lattice, a discrete structure composed of nodes and links that represent quantized units of spacetime geometry at the Planck scale (\( \ell_P \approx 1.616 \times 10^{-35} \) meters).<br><br>- **Nodes**: Represent quantized volumes.<br>- **Links**: Represent quantized areas connecting nodes.<br>- **Quantum States**: Each node and link carries quantum numbers corresponding to geometric quantities.<br><br><b>*2.2. Emergence of Spacetime*</b><br><br>Classical spacetime emerges as a macroscopic approximation of the QGL when quantum fluctuations average out. In this limit, the discrete structure of the QGL gives rise to a continuous manifold described by classical general relativity.<br><br><b>*2.3. Emergence of Matter*</b><br><br>Matter fields are modeled as excitations or topological defects within the QGL. These excitations manifest as particles in the emergent spacetime, and their interactions are governed by the underlying quantum geometric structure.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*3. Mathematical Formulation*</b><br><br><b>*3.1. Hilbert Space of the QGL*</b><br><br>The quantum states of the QGL are defined within a Hilbert space \( \mathcal{H}_{\text{QGL}} \), spanned by basis states \( | \Gamma, \{j_l\}, \{i_n\} \rangle \):<br><br>- \( \Gamma \): The graph representing the lattice structure.<br>- \( j_l \): Spin representations on links, related to quantized areas.<br>- \( i_n \): Intertwiners at nodes, ensuring the conservation of quantum numbers.<br><br><b>*3.2. Quantum Geometry Operators*</b><br><br>- **Area Operator (\( \hat{A}_S \))**:<br><br>  \[<br>  \hat{A}_S | \Gamma, \{j_l\}, \{i_n\} \rangle = 8\pi \ell_P^2 \sum_{l \in S} \sqrt{j_l (j_l + 1)} | \Gamma, \{j_l\}, \{i_n\} \rangle,<br>  \]<br><br>  where \( S \) is a surface intersecting the links \( l \).<br><br>- **Volume Operator (\( \hat{V}_R \))**:<br><br>  \[<br>  \hat{V}_R | \Gamma, \{j_l\}, \{i_n\} \rangle = \ell_P^3 \sum_{n \in R} \sqrt{\text{Invariant involving } i_n} | \Gamma, \{j_l\}, \{i_n\} \rangle,<br>  \]<br><br>  where \( R \) is a region containing nodes \( n \).<br><br><b>*3.3. Dynamics of the QGL*</b><br><br>The evolution of the QGL is described using spin foam models, which represent the history of spin networks (the QGL states) in &quot;quantum time.&quot; The transition amplitude between initial and final states is given by:<br><br>\[<br>\langle \Psi_f | \Psi_i \rangle = \sum_{\text{Spin Foams}} \mathcal{A}[\text{Spin Foam}],<br>\]<br><br>where \( \mathcal{A}[\text{Spin Foam}] \) is the amplitude associated with each spin foam.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*4. Emergence of Matter and Forces*</b><br><br><b>*4.1. Incorporation of Matter Fields*</b><br><br>Matter fields are incorporated into the QGL by extending the labels on nodes and links:<br><br>- **Fermions**: Represented by Grassmann variables at nodes, ensuring anti-commutation relations.<br>- **Bosons**: Gauge fields are introduced through additional labels on links, corresponding to internal symmetry groups.<br><br><b>*4.2. Gauge Symmetries*</b><br><br>Local gauge invariance arises naturally from the topology and symmetries of the QGL:<br><br>\[<br>\psi_n \rightarrow U_n \psi_n, \quad \phi_l \rightarrow U_n \phi_l U_m^\dagger,<br>\]<br><br>where \( U_n \) are elements of the gauge group at node \( n \).<br><br><b>*4.3. Interactions*</b><br><br>Interactions between matter fields and geometry are mediated through the QGL structure:<br><br>- **Minimal Coupling**: Replacing partial derivatives with covariant derivatives defined on the QGL.<br>- **Yukawa Interactions**: Generated by specific configurations and interactions within the lattice.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*5. Unification Mechanism*</b><br><br><b>*5.1. Unified Action*</b><br><br>The total action \( S_{\text{QGU}} \) governing the QGL is:<br><br>\[<br>S_{\text{QGU}} = S_{\text{geom}} + S_{\text{matter}} + S_{\text{int}},<br>\]<br><br>where:<br><br>- \( S_{\text{geom}} \): Action for pure quantum geometry.<br>- \( S_{\text{matter}} \): Action for matter fields.<br>- \( S_{\text{int}} \): Interaction terms between geometry and matter.<br><br><b>*5.2. Background Independence*</b><br><br>QGU is background-independent; spacetime geometry is not a fixed backdrop but emerges dynamically from the QGL&#39;s quantum states.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*6. Resolution of Singularities and Quantum Gravity Effects*</b><br><br><b>*6.1. Absence of Singularities*</b><br><br>The discrete nature of the QGL introduces a minimum length scale, effectively regularizing the singularities encountered in classical general relativity, such as those at the centers of black holes or the Big Bang.<br><br><b>*6.2. Black Hole Thermodynamics*</b><br><br>- **Quantized Horizon Area**: The entropy \( S_{\text{BH}} \) of a black hole is proportional to its horizon area:<br><br>  \[<br>  S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{k_B}{4 \ell_P^2} A_{\text{horizon}},<br>  \]<br><br>  consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.<br><br>- **Hawking Radiation**: Modeled as quantum transitions within the QGL near the black hole horizon.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*7. Predictions and Experimental Tests*</b><br><br><b>*7.1. Modified Dispersion Relations*</b><br><br>QGU predicts energy-dependent modifications to particle dispersion relations:<br><br>\[<br>E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 + \eta \frac{E^3}{E_{\text{Planck}}},<br>\]<br><br>where \( \eta \) is a dimensionless parameter.<br><br><b>*7.2. Potential Observational Signatures*</b><br><br>- **Time-of-Flight Differences**: High-energy photons from distant astrophysical sources may exhibit measurable delays.<br>- **Cosmic Microwave Background**: Possible imprints of quantum gravitational effects in the form of anomalies or non-Gaussianities.<br>- **Gravitational Waves**: Deviations from general relativity predictions in gravitational wave propagation.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*8. Addressing Challenges*</b><br><br><b>*8.1. Mathematical Consistency*</b><br><br>Ensuring the internal consistency of QGU involves:<br><br>- **Anomaly Cancellation**: Demonstrating that gauge and gravitational anomalies cancel out.<br>- **Unitarity and Causality**: Maintaining these fundamental principles within the quantum framework.<br><br><b>*8.2. Compatibility with the Standard Model*</b><br><br>- **Particle Spectrum**: Reproducing the known particles and interactions of the Standard Model.<br>- **Coupling Constants**: Deriving the values of fundamental constants from the QGL structure.<br><br><b>*8.3. Experimental Accessibility*</b><br><br>Identifying low-energy phenomena or astrophysical observations that could provide empirical support for QGU&#39;s predictions.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*9. Future Directions*</b><br><br><b>*9.1. Mathematical Development*</b><br><br>- **Analytical Solutions**: Seeking exact or approximate solutions in specific regimes.<br>- **Numerical Simulations**: Employing computational methods to simulate QGL dynamics.<br><br><b>*9.2. Theoretical Extensions*</b><br><br>- **Supersymmetry and Beyond**: Exploring extensions that could further unify interactions.<br>- **Connections to Other Theories**: Investigating relationships with existing frameworks like loop quantum gravity and string theory.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*10. Conclusion*</b><br><br>Quantum Geometric Unification offers a speculative but promising framework for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity. By positing a discrete quantum geometric foundation, it addresses key challenges such as singularities and the unification of fundamental forces. While much work remains to develop the mathematical formalism and explore potential experimental tests, QGU provides a novel perspective that could contribute to the ongoing quest for a Theory of Everything.<br><br>---<br><br><b>*References*</b><br><br>1.

üåíüåêüíøüìÄüåêüåòThere are no differences between the BH singularity and the BB singularity. Inside a BH singularity/Event Horizon, space/time goes negative from the outside vantage point. There is a common misconception that the singularity is non-dimensional, but that only holds true from the outside. Within the Schwarzschild radius we enter POSITIVE space. It is important to differentiate between the OUTSIDE &amp; INSIDE of the Event Horizon. Space, matter, light and time is REVERSED traversing the boundary. Meaning that the dimensionality of a BH is flipped related to outside vantage point. The dimensionality within a BH is infinite, giving birth/access to a whole new universe. Within a BH, new spacetime is infinite, entering a fractally new universe that in turn gives birth to new matter, new spacetime and in turn new BHs that repeat this process forever. This also solves issues with the Information Paradox. The IP is only relevant from an outside vantage point. Within the negative singularity information is conserved and is holographically stored within the Photon Sphere, where it fundamentally can feed both the outside and inside of the Event Horizon, simultaneously applying Holographic Principles.

Having a singularity as zero point, even in QM, is problematic because it requires time dilation to be instant. Using holographic principles and implementing applied graduality in M√∂bian mathematics provides a much smoother transition regarding transfer of energy and entropy.<br><br><br><br>üåêüåëüåê<br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Whereas some derivations and concepts might seem counterintuitive using classical thinking, fully understanding HH requires inter/multidimensional, spherical vision.¬†<br><br><br><br>Many of the derivations, math and logic are visual and plastic on an interdimensional level. At certain conjunctions our math breaks down and the only way to peak into principles of infinity or approaching infinity with HH is to use a new standard of math that simply doesn&#39;t translate to numbers. Numbers in the universe beyond a certain point are fundamentally null. Classical math breaks down when approaching infinity.¬†<br><br><br>üåíüåêüåò<br><br><br><br>Understanding that time dilation in relativity also is less drastic locally because of quantum fields, quantum entanglement and holographic principles. Once you approach extreme gravity fields, such as neutron stars and black holes, the normal attributes and effects of gravity is less severe within the local relativistic grid, because the matter that is caught in the gravity field is indeed light itself and gravity is a function of light, so the acceleration experienced by the subject is much more gradual and doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to spaghettification, because matter is fundamentally made of light, thus rendering a smoother transition within local fields.<br><br><br><br>There is a possible misconception that black holes are more destructive to local events, because we have implemented a differentiation between matter, light and energy. Proposing that light and motion are¬† the fundamental forces in physics solves several of the empirical findings in our universe - from local events to the very large.<br><br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is also a possibility that the laws of nature might change from region to region in the universe. Applying the same unified functions everywhere might not be applicable - based on the observer. Quantum Mechanics combined with holographic principles in conjunction with relativity might produce variations that are stable within physicality as a whole. But they might also produce temporal shift variations that might fluctuate between timelines, not compromising the stability of the system as a whole.<br><br><br><br>Temporal shifts pose little/no threat to quantum fields in macro or micro, because the energy transfer between two or several more points are conserved within holographic principles.<br><br><br><br>Best way to explain is superpositions of quantum fields. But using spherical understanding we might end up with <b>hyperpositions</b> in addition, meaning that within multiverse theory and/or paralell physics, we can propose that local variations might occur elsewhere.<br><br><br><br>One might suspect that this could be inherently unstable, but hopefully stability is ensured by¬†<br><br><br><b>Special</b> and <b>General Relativity</b> in conjunction with¬†<br><br><br><b>HyperTensored Holigraphy</b><br><br><br><br><b>QM &amp; QFT</b> are ultimately functions of <b>HH</b> - because all forces, all phenomenons, energy, polarities and particles are fundamentally holographic, thus made of light.¬†<br><br><br><br><b>Diverge Planck</b> and apply <b>HyperTensorality</b> to:<br><br><br><br>v=d-(t¬≥c¬≥)<br><br><br><br>If one might observe local effects that seem irreversible to the observer, the stability/instability of said system might return to its relative position in space as they where when the temporal shift gradually occurred.¬†<br><br><br>A <b>Rosen/Einstein</b> bridge might be folded back onto itself, reestablishing pre-existing physicality relative to the initial motion through space time.

The state of string theory: dead. But still good for a long seminar.
Weyl: <br><br>Thus the colors with their various qualities and intensities fulfill the axioms of vector geometry if addition is interpreted as mixing; consequently, projective geometry applies to the color qualities.<br><br>Kline:<br><br>The principle of duality in projective geometry states that we can interchange point and line in a theorem about figures lying in one plane and obtain a meaningful statement. Moreover, the new or dual statement will itself be a theorem ‚Äî that is, it can be proven. On the basis of what has been presented here we cannot see why this must always be the case for the dual statement. However, it is possible to show by one proof that every rephrasing of a theorem of projective geometry in accordance with the principle of duality must be a theorem. This principle is a remarkable characteristic of projective geometry. It reveals the symmetry in the roles that point and line play in the structure of that geometry.<br><br>Atiyah:<br><br>Very recently, in the last two years, Witten and his collaborators (mainly Kapustin and Gukov, two young Russians) have managed to deduce what is required for the geometric Langlands program from non-abelian dualities in physics. The kind of dualities they use are close to the dualities in Donaldson‚Äôs theory and to the dualities in the mirror symmetry, and are based (at least) on the electric-magnetic duality.<br><br>The original dualities in physics are those between electricity and magnetism. They are very well understood and known, but it is a linear theory. When people started to play with non-linear theories, and tried to look for some- thing analogous to duality, they had vague ideas that perhaps is would be possible to have some generalization of the electromagnetic duality to the non-abelian case.

Correction: &quot; The absolute state of string theory, just look at it, look at the state of it&quot;
I love how Greene organized and conducted this discussion
Just found this, rare to see Witten.. Witten and Brian Greene? Stardust.
String theory aims to unify nature&#39;s fundamental forces by proposing that the basic building blocks of the universe are not point particles but tiny, vibrating strings. This theory holds the promise of bridging gaps between quantum mechanics and general relativity, potentially leading to a comprehensive &quot;theory of everything.&quot; However, string theory remains highly complex and speculative, with ongoing debates about its validity and implications. As we explore its potential to unify nature&#39;s laws, a key question arises: Can string theory provide a complete and accurate description of the universe, or are there fundamental limitations we must overcome?
Asking them to grade themselves is like asking me to grade my own English paper. I&#39;d give string theory a C for good effort, but no results. A+ for contributions to Math. String theory should have been abandoned when they discovered 26 dimensions, but instead, these misguided physicists starting patching the theory with stuff like supersymmetry.
Que hermoso aporte.<br>Gracias
I swear brian got the best contacts  in the game of science outreach. Nobel prize winners and field metalist. Each of the guys would make a great interview on their own.
Somewhere Eric Weinstein is losing his mind.
Witten is probably the smartest person living, if not ever.
I think human consciousness and emotions are part of the answer(perhaps each could be a different dimension). We are all made up of strings that operating at different vibrations. Is it really far fetched to imagine that are thoughts manifest into the universe via strings. Everything is relative. I also think that the string theorist need to start incorporating scientists from other disciplines to help solve and test string theory. For example, involving a neuroscientist could potentially measure neuron activity could then be translated into a geometric equation. Then it could be proved out. That‚Äôs my theory
Witten is a beast
String theory needs to start looking at the studies on the brain as a quantum entity
Interesting. Thank you.  One thing is very evident among all the participants: TIME!!!
To enlighten puzzled scientists and masses regarding &#39; Skink&#39; theory. The subjective relative dimension of Aritificial existence in an auto organic realm.
It is not easy to prove or justify theory or something like &#39;String&#39; theory. Have you heard if the new phenomenon &#39; Skink theory&#39; breaking scientific barriers leaving mathematicians puzzled, first discovered in Berlin 2022.
It is through scientists proving that well-accepted theories are wrong that scientific understanding progresses.
If nothing acts like a clock there is no time either.
Short summary of a great, well conducted discussion among some of the best scientists today:<br>In a universe that is not ours (AdS) we have a correspondence that nobody has seen based on two basic concepts (black holes and entanglement) that nobody understands. <br>The solution to the conundrum is String Theory, a framework that has never made a testable prediction and quite a few people distrust as a waste of time.<br>Tells you that there&#39;s still much work to do!
I just cannot accept a hypothesis,  (i.e. strings) around for over almost 70 years and not one single testable premise has been realized. Why don&#39;t theorists work with  theories which have passed muster by experimenters and expand in those directions.  Also i am of the opinion gravity is a&#39; property&#39; of spacetime, in a Higgs field,, not a force with a particle to be hunted down and measured.
String theory, a mathematical playground with no ties to physical reality! Lololol
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjDxk9ZnYJQ&amp;t=2708">45:08</a> the labels for the quarks and leptons along with their super counterparts are incorrect. This proves string theory to be unreliable. <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>
One way of testing a theory is to see how well it does in making predictions. The string theory based prediction for the energy of the Higgs particle was way off. I have never heard any explanation about why that was but it seems to me to cast doubt about the theory&#39;s competence.
Interesting that these string theorists describe GR as an inconsistent theory and in the same sentence mention Quantum Mechanics as if is consistent. On top of this, string theory requires so many degrees of freedom (ten to twenty spatial dimensions).

I love listening to Edward Witten.<br>His voice is so soothing.
It seems that within the context of anti-de Sitter / conformal field theory where there is a 2-dimensional screen running a projection informed by methods designed to translate / project or emerge from an 11-dimensional array of space-time where locations intersect with events, all locations and all events could be simultaneously stored on the 11-dimensional array.  Alternatively, perhaps there are very specific dimensions dedicated to location and / or event storage. Observers encoded inside the 11-dimensional array could perceive projected images of themselves interacting with renditions of these projections filtered through a 3-dimensional illusion and perhaps only sequentially in one direction, perceived as temporal causality or time.  Editing is feasible by observers at an event / location intersection but at the point of editing causality simultaneously cascades in all directions. The observers, at the conscious level, can only process one direction of change and automatically &#39;remember&#39; all retrofitted event changes intersecting any of their locations as the past.
Mass delusion
I was metaphysically (or ontologically) astounded to hear (one of ) them say that the equivalence principle is ingrained in Newton&#39;s identification of inertial and gravitational mass, when they very well know that in fact GR renounces to the idea of  gravitation as a force; in which case gravitational and inertial masses could be orders of magnitud different without any change in a body&#39;s free motion in a pure gravitational spacetime.<br><br>What is salient in GR really is locality, the idea that mass distant presence, by some mechanism (via Grav Waves) has previously  set up the space-time curvature and then, without the originating mass&#39;es intervention or exertion of any kind of distant pulling, space-time itself then and there, geometrically  determines motion<br><br>Where inertial and material (gravitational) mass come to be identified, - or rather shown to be proportinal- is in the Higgs Field&#39;s inertia giving mechanism
Is the ring singularity compatible with string theory
Figure out the ratio of gravity to mass of earth and scale it down to the quantam level.
The Question, of course space is vast though dimensions are lurking somewhere or beside you, in space in particular how can you therefore map the Quantum field theory in space often dubbed as General Relativity in wavy nets, just where in space are the horizontals where you can map the Quantum fields or would it be that it goes in different directions because as stars collide or to a greater extent when galaxies collide sometimes it created very vast fields of gravity mass in space in different directions, would that cause the inversion of worlds because it could have concentrate into its polarities or where a greater number of negative particles and of positive particles concentrated in space as the polars meaning the quantum fields become upside down? In the mind, does depression or gladness cause some space in the mind in depressive mind state and a sort of close circuitries when it comes to close bonds with peers and relatives? Or does the mind effect of closeness separate that into another mind general relativity and quantum mechanics in the dark mind dimension whose neuronal make up arrangements in illuminations in the brain have resemblance to the universal spider web like or cotton like galaxy illumination arrangements in structures?

The Higgs Event Horizon concept suggests that Linear Energy (Matter Energy and Photonic Energy) cannot overlap or occupy the same space as Loop Field Energy. Quarks and Quark Flux Tubes fully exclude the Higgs Field, and that means that Linear Energy can operate at above Light Speed. So your Yellow Shell image is how the Higgs Event Horizon explains the nature of Black Holes. The Yellow Shell is the limit of the Higgs‚Äô Field‚Äôs Influence, and you would say that all of the Data of the energy within the Yellow Shell is encrypted on the Shell, but the energy within the shell has zero gravitational effect applied to it and so can operate randomly at above light speed . This is where there might be Kolabi-Yau type organisations of massive energy flows.<br>Time is proportional to the Flow of Energy and Light Speed, so inside a Black Hole of this concept time might be massively accelerated, and energy that escapes the Black Hole will do so way into the future. Energy that escapes now will be from the distant past.
David Gross suggests that it is too difficult so far to observe the Quantum effects of Gravity, but he has it around the wrong way. What is needed and totally possible to observe the quantum origins of Gravity. Where do we see this? In 3 places every day: at the event horizon of a Black Hole, at the confinement barrier of the energy of Protons and Neutrons, and at the Hadron Collider where it takes immense amounts of energy to push a hand full of Protons to near the Speed of Light. All 3 of these are derived from the same fundamental phenomenon, the limitation of the speed of light,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.which is a property of the Higgs Field. <br>This is where Physicists are failing, they are failing to connect these 3 realities because they believe that the confinement of Quarks is a property of Gluons. But what are Gluons? They are what the energy of the Higgs Field resolves to when you smash the Proton. They see a thing and give it a name then build maths to hypothesize how that ‚ÄúGluon Particle‚Äù was confining the Quarks, when that is not what was going on at all. You all know that the Proton approaching the Speed of Light has immense energy, and know that that kinetic energy is carried by the Proton but don‚Äôt seem to realise that that energy is Higgs Field Energy from the reaction of the accelerated particle with in the Higgs Field. This is exactly the reaction that is produced by quarks attempting to escape and travel away from where they are but are confined by the Higgs Field and creating a kind of Turbulent Energy Event Horizon which when smashed observably resolves momentarily to a number of Gluon Particles. <br>The role of the string theorists is to develop an understanding of what is the type and nature of strings that will give these properties. <br>The method to test this notion is to realise that the kinetic energy of a Proton at near light speed is effectively Matter. Matter that has not been contained to become a matter particle, so is in fact Phantom Matter. Phantom matter, which is matter that has been ‚Äúcreated‚Äù can be observed in several ways. It can be observed to deflect the path of light (a laser beam) and where the Proton Beam of the LHC can be deflect from one ring to another the instantaneous presence of the Phantom Energy of the accelerated Protons should cause a micro gravitational ripple observable with a LIGO type device.
Do any of these guys talk on how we&#39;re being run ,the world üåé, by aliens and we follow ancient pagan religions and God&#39;s.  If you can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s going on earth how can you trust anything they say?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjDxk9ZnYJQ&amp;t=270">4:30</a>‚Ä¶ The confidence the physicist had at the turn of the century was due to them not bothering to understand what philosophers already understood hundreds of years earlier.

The problem might not be the physical theories , it could be the fact that they are using classical math.   Math needs a good overhaul because it is totally based on classical physics.   We need a quantum math.   A quantum math would  have numbers that are forbidden and no continuous real numbers as in contemporary math.    Also ideas like zero and infinity are classical.  We all know classical physics is wrong so why keep building math up based on it?  For example , you can&#39;t have an empty set.   There is always something tunneling into a set , the quantum waves of whatever will be very tiny but not zero.  Logic also needs an overhaul because as we know things can be true and false at the same time , as in Schrodinger&#39;s cat.   Electrons can be spin up and spin down at the same time.   Classical logic does  not allow things like this and this is the origin of Russell&#39;s paradox.  If you start thinking in terms of the quantum world, then there is no Russell&#39;s paradox. The barber who shaves only those who don&#39;t shave themselves can exist in a superposition of shaving himself and not shaving himself.
I see theoretical physicists as kind of map makers.  Both Quantum and string are like maps of the London underground... Not the actual reality, but, a useful tool to help us navigate the space... or spacetime. X] ... My personal belief is, that it has more to do with sound, frequencies and vibrations, than we yet understand. And that the fabric of spacetime and strings, are more closely related than current thinking. Of course, we will fumble our way in the darkness of ignorance to the eventual, elegant complete theory. But,we&#39;re still a long way off.
Zero point field would blow 186,000 miles a second out of the water water
It‚Äôs the same reason why you have a line over the last number of your calculations because it goes on for infinity. We have an actually devise the algorithms to understand quantum relativity so we just keep thinking about quantum mechanics and unified Field Theory like a crossword puzzle as it were. We cannot be the same material ‚Äústuff‚Äù. but we can be a symphony of bosons and   Fermions
Even if you were to think of yourself on the elemental chart, all molecules are moving even the most still molecular‚Äùstuff‚Äù that you imagine would still have a vibrational wavelength. So you can‚Äôt imagine things as a different form of matter, but just as a symphony and harmonious algorithm of vibration.
Even if it‚Äôs traveled at 186,000 mi./s you have to understand it was still rip a hole in the time space in crate a black hole or a Einstein Rosen Tambridge, which were not able to compensate for at this time frame with ampacity of electromagnetism
It would rip from the sun to the Earth and would be a rip in the time. Space continuum unless you add something to correct for it mathematically like a planet X.
I suggested all scientists stop becoming atheists just because it‚Äôs popular to be an atheist scientist. And understand that by meditation upon your higher power, even if that is ethics and a greater good for all of humanity that you would re-create gray matter and create neural pathways and make your brain stronger to help us all of us, without having to claim or something that has been used to oppress society anthropologically
If there was one cosmic engineer or multiple, you would have to understand the laws that have been put in play. To understand what is quantifiable and re-credible and laboratory. And that is science if you can re-create the results, you can quantify a divinely ordained algorithm and is no longervoodoo or magic it is science
The law of gravity worked just as efficiently before newtons discovery. An apple that bumps you on your melon will hurt just the same with the same with a  (a brick wall isn‚Äôt benevolent or malevolent. It‚Äôs just a wall if you hit the wall, it will hurt the knuckles of the man or woman that punch it) gravitational pull. You don‚Äôt have to believe in karma, but you‚Äôll still get messed up when you re-put yourself we don‚Äôt understand unified Field Theory, or quantum Field Theory or genetic mapping, but we understand that these things are mathematically, correct and have to be proved and one way or another. Otherwise, our universe would make sense. If you are actual scientist, you would begin to meditate because even if you were an atheist, you could believe in a higher consensus of ethics, and understand that the more you meditate the more neural pathways is in gray matter in your brain, you would create to be a smarter individual to conceptualize science and how to solve the world problems, even if you didn‚Äôt believe in higher power
Blah, blah, blah... they know nothing, and speculate everything.  String theory... the universe is made out of strings.  Ok.  Now what?  Ah.. how about topping the cosmic spaghetti with M-sauce?   Just a bunch of ignorant chosenites stroking each other for their &quot;genius&quot;.
Mirroring is simple without blind spots/blackholes whatever. Fun house mirrors?

Understanding comes through perception.  We basically cannot understand something unless we can measure it.  Machines are more objective than hairless apes.
THANK YOU... PROFESSORS...!!!<br><br>(From an unofficial Student).
Watch David Gross speak carefully. Once you still Jack Nicholson you cant unsee it.
What a panel! The same boring questions...
String theory is a failure. It&#39;s math gymnastics that is unfalsifiable and had to add magical dimensions that are also untestable.
Congratulations Professor Greene. You are a master moderator. A virtuoso conductor. This panel discussion watched (can I say that) like a thriller. You managed to bring these difficult topics a little closer to us mere mortals by teasing out key concepts from your panelists like a maestro who gets the most of his string section (yeah, a bad pun). It was a privilege and a treat to watch this discussion.
‚ÄúThe Final Theory: Rethinking Our Scientific Legacy ‚Äú, Mark McCutcheon. All down gravity- Aristotle, Newton, LeSage,Mach, Einstein, Wheeler, Zee, Penrose etc- wrong. Up gravity- McCutcheon (Expansion Theory)- correct. So,no.
In one sentence (timestamp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjDxk9ZnYJQ&amp;t=2920">48:40</a>) Brian Greene summarised what Dr Sabine Hossenfelder has previously explained about where we actually are with String Theory. Lack of evidence and lack of proof.  But more importantly she also explains the physics grift of asking for even bigger colliders and more research dollars. When David Gross linked the old &amp; possibly dying String Theory to the new (hotness) Quantum field theory, however genuine he might be, it feels like another grift to this layman.
Hi I&#39;m Brian Gerne and I&#39;m stupid enough to believe math over physical reality.
So with the new Webb discovery all of this is just shot out the door except the god theory God bless those that believe
Oh boy, I don&#39;t think Sabine Hossenfelder would agree.

String theory is promising since quantum theory collapses beyond the local horizon. String links superseed the galactic forces  found in the state of plasma and gravitational lensing. This is where the common denominator between quantum and string emerge.

A lovely video, but there is pathos too. They are not young, and there is an elephant in the room that they work so hard to ignore. The elephant whispers things like &quot;that lightweight superpartner thing didn&#39;t work out, did it?&quot; And &quot;remember the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model?&quot; And &quot;It does seem we live in a de Sitter space - doesn&#39;t KKLT feel like purpose-built number torturing to you?&quot; The elephant needn&#39;t be strident, but it is infinitely patient. It will never, never, never go away.
I would be very interested for you to expand on this!
@@Billybo121 These are older string theorists. Along with many, many other scientists they have spent most of their adult lives working on string theory. As a sub-discipline of physics, there is relatively little to show for the effort (there have been more significant contributions to mathematics, but that&#39;s not physics). For this and deeper reasons I don&#39;t have the space here to go into, string theory has become extremely controversial. These experts go to great lengths to avoid the controversy--to the extent that if you&#39;re not already aware of the state of physics, you wouldn&#39;t even know the controversy existed. I think if you search around the internet, you can easily find better explanations of the details than I could give here.
Theyre also dancing around the subject that their work has not resulted in much of a physical result

no michio kaku ? i tought they were trying to hype people about a dead end theory...
String Theory is an abject, unverifiable failure that has held particle physics back for decades. This self-aggrandizing apologist video is depressing and disgraceful. Historians of science will look back at this era and shake their heads, befuddled and amazed how this train wreck dominated our paradigms for this long. Truly sad and pathetic.
Physicists will never find the correct path forward if they insist that all that has happened to get them to this point where they are now has been correct.   Quantum mechanics, even though very accurate, is incomplete.  Special Relativity, however, is deeply flawed and that is why the speakers here moved quickly away from it.  Criticism of it is has been going on for over a century by both physicists and non-physicists.  The physicists are not permitted to speak of it to keep their jobs and the non-physicists are just ignored.
I&#39;m surprised String Theory still has such a clutch on public discourse. I thought it was basically dead.
Wow, such a blatant attempt to push string theory over all other things and toot its own horn over and over. What a weak discussion.
It really seems to me that the challenge of narrowing down the &quot;swampland&quot; and &quot;string theory landscape&quot; is going to have to utilize AI. To be clear this is not a lazy 2023 bro take of just throwing an LLM at the problem, right now the tools I&#39;m imagining don&#39;t exist, and I&#39;m rather pessimistic about AI generally in fact. Bit there&#39;s simply not enough human experts out their to narrow this down it seems, there&#39;s just so so many possibilities. Finding solutions in complexity like that is exactly what Machine Learning is great at, and I really don&#39;t seen any other way to effectively narrow down the potential models that work. I say this painfully aware as a programmer myself of how difficult it is to make an &quot;AI&quot; that understands real world mechanics, in fact its actually an unsolved problem and a very active area of research. And too be clear that this isn&#39;t a lazy uniformed &quot;AI everything&quot; take, LLMs are completely ruled out towards this end.
Strings are a lie and barely a theory. Brian is salty that his life‚Äôs work is a null result. Take nothing he says at face value.
Real lack of representation here! We need a trans poc or 3 on the stage

Science it a wonderful we humans are lucky to have. By the way i ain‚Äôt no genius and quite frankly got into it more like a month ago. Now it‚Äôs hard to picture how everything works but you can definitely imagine. <br><br>My thoughts on fields are that they‚Äôre like the ingredients in a dish that are different but also come together to then produce something else that‚Äôs completely different, so fields give different properties to the infinitely shifting possibilities of reality, fields collide energies intermingle with what they should the ripples sent out are the many results of this collision and if you hold as a base that the all of existence is energy which gives the universe it‚Äôs vibration frequency and at different frequencies different things occur so gravity would be the universe specific frequency for entanglement to occur, more entanglement = more energy = more mass by which all this you measure with SpaceTime the 3 dimensions will correspond to the height of the wave from peak to lowest, depth or speed of the wave, width being the area affected by the entanglement and time is just the duration of that entanglement. Now we all know whatever borrowed energy to cause and entanglement is returned would mean all these collisions are both the start and end but something stops reality from ending up like a blackhole stretching this reaction or entanglement‚Ä¶ yeah im rambling and my thoughts just couldn‚Äôt imagine up anymore
One of the best interviews I have ever seen, thank you so much !
what does string theory say about dark matter ?
String theory is essentially a framework that gives rise to a semi-infinite number of specific theories, each of which predicts a different set of fundamental particles and particle behaviors. Some of these endless possibilities predict undiscovered particles like &quot;axions&quot; that have not been ruled out by experiment and that potentially play the role of dark matter. There are a semi-infinite number of these possibilities too, and we have no way to find one that is correct versus the many that make predictions in conflict with experiment. For all we know, <b>every</b> string theory is conflict with experiment. This has been the situation for 40 years, and there&#39;s no sign of any change.
sad how they so tenaciously cling to this dead theory.
They are trying to create it.
RiP to any that wasted 20/30/40 years on ST. All the elegent, major breakthroughs in physics had almost immediate applications. How long will you continue to flog this dead horse?

Edward is sitting there not even looking at the graphics on the screen, thinking I know everything. I know GOD&#39;s thoughts!
Intuitively, the spatial dimensions can be conceived as emergent phenomena, and the other dimensions as well, but time must be fundamental to all of them. <br><br>My hypothesis is that in the beginning there was time and oscillations in time, with harmonics, created the dimensions. Time slowed from perhaps infinitely fast down  to the speed of light, the energy went into the oscillations and harmonics until it exploded and there was an inflation of spacetime.
Time is that which the clocks show. It&#39;s already emergent at the Newtonian level. :-)

Brian, Andrew, David and Edward, unifying Nature&#39;s Laws and a Theory of Everything is only possible if we have a full understanding of HOW and WHY Quantum Gravity works. The Real True Nature of Quantum Gravity theory will debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1.

FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1.

Mate you do know the theory which they are searching for is the theory of everything which not even einstein was able to do so and as for technology we barely have any to test string theory we need a particle accelerator of the size of a galaxy
@@boogieman6529 &quot;we need a particle accelerator of the size of a galaxy&quot; yep, you summarized perfectly why this theory is useless.
It&#39;s so cool to be able to see four guys, who compared to me have <i>STUPENDOUS</i> intellects, especially in their chosen fields, and see they are able to laugh a bit at the quirks and foibles of their professions, just as a group of plumbers, or electricians, or yoga instructors, or school teachers can laugh at <i>their</i> peer&#39;s quirks.    üôÇ   AND IT SEEMS the comment (that shows up just before mine on this screen) was written by someone kinda&#39; making the same point!!!
Did he say &quot;matter is what emerges from quantum field fluctuations&quot; or &quot;from quantum field flatulences&quot;?
Matter is string. Quantum is dark. Algorithms that decrypt superpositions are flawed concerning time propagation reversals. It‚Äôs really a spin in the wrong direction.
&quot;Particles that carry forces&quot;... we are back to the animism...
The so called &quot;speed of light&quot; is a fundamental limit since the very beginning of quantization, since c is the quantic absolute speed: at the same time the minimum speed at microscopic level and the maximum speed at macroscopic level: but this apparent paradox is a very simple consequence of quantization of the space-time.
UFT asyymptotes to - Universe ages:  ((0.123456789...m/s)^3 &amp; c^3/ Earth mass or per Universe mass, results in  ‚âà 1 predicted gravitational constant gradient according to projective unified field theory.

Brian, discover the Graviton. If you could put your finger on one item, thing, that would change the world, is the graviton.
What a beautiful collection of TRUE scientists. Of course they are intelligent but more striking is how polite, humble, and understanding they are. Laying out the knowledge for everyone who wants to hear, no gatekeeping, no selling of some kind of product. True examples for future scientists, including myself.
Einstein&#39;s STR and GTR physics needs to be based on Absolute Quantum Materialistic Realism. Quantum Mechanics and the Copenhagen Interpretation cannot be unified with Einstein&#39;s physics because the latter is indeterministic, non-local, and based on a nothingness domain with a false vacuum continuum based on emergent abstract geometries. In wave/corpuscular duality, it is the corpuscular theory that must persist to the very end of analysis. &quot;Nothingness&quot; is actually based on point electrical charges and thermal dynamic physical properties, and it is the infinite density and infinite extendedness that is the immutable, transparent, and indivisible domain seen as the nothingness and the so-called false vacuum. The warping of spacetime, based on the Cosmological Set Theory of subsets of particle/antiparticles and sparticles/anti-sparticles, has to be explained through causal deterministic physical properties and not mechanical and one-sided abstractions as done by the Copenhagen Interpretation of physics.
Thanks a lot. I have read many popular science books on string theory. Got more clarity after watching this great video  üëç.
Sir can I get your address please, I have to post a letter to you putting my view on gravitation. I am from üáÆüá≥India
Lord Kelvin was a real dick, regardless of what he said about Physics.
the only way you could improve on this panel is to wake up einstein
His brain had been stolen mate and his body is already burnt also your joke is lame
Wow. First time seeing edward witten speak  since i heard him first on jre by eric Weinstein
Beyond theory, how is string theory attested within physics?
the basic issue of time and space emerging, is a bit clouded, ultimately we want a theory of something, that is changing. this forces us to pick representations. the basic problem is so simple that it is easy to miss. for example you can ask someone to show you the number 2, not a representation, not the symbol, but what the concept 2 really is. obviously that is not going to work. if there is such a thing as the number 2 independent of our representations of it, that is the meaning of the concept, then we have to pick some representation, to, well... represent it. <br>this is way too simple to be easily noticeable as a problem, but when there are many different kinds of representations, the &quot;real concept&quot; is what all those representations have on common, but that sometimes leads to people thinking that there is a representation that is really the real form and not a representation, but that is not the case. the only such object we can have access to is nature, through our cognition, we do not need to pick a representation of it, it just is, but ofc we do not have full access to it in terms of understanding, including the limits of that limitation, which makes it philosophically tricky to deal with, there is a lot of room to make stupidly simple errors in epistemology or metaphysics because of it. when it comes to the emergence of time and space, let us instead look at it backwards, let us take empty space and time for granted and look at what can be concluded about the difference of representations of metrics in such a space. at first glance you might think there is something there, you imagine grids that define time and define space, in all sorts of arbitrary ways, but just the fact that we are looking at empty space means that there is nothing there to change, and when the space itself changes over its own time, there is nothing there to experience it, no matter at all, no radiation, no nothing, we can then make the metrics dynamical, make it self interacting and so on, but still there is no appreciable there there(unless the dynamical properties of the metrics obtain non trivial dynamics). we can consider non trivial metric self interaction as a postulate of content, so let&#39;s ignore that for the moment. in truly empty space and time there is nothing, no meaning to lengths, not local order in time, no meaning to time elapsed. all that is left is a kind of topological quality of local kind, the dimensional, but without any content, even that is meaningless physically. the argument then goes, that since postulating empty space is postulating absolutely nothing physical, means that we can safely use it for purposes of representation without fear that we are making assumptions about the structure of what is inside, to a decent degree at least. time inside such a space, and lengths, plus connectivity, is emergent from the dynamics of the theory we postulate to be in the space. dimensionality in this space locally is just a feature of the dynamics, we can assume an infinite dimensional, euclidian empty space, and build a theory of interacting matter however we like as long as the dynamics are those of some finite spatial dimensionality, the mathematical basis of that kind of treatment is difficult to put into you tube comment, but it is in it&#39;s essence pretty simple, it is about dimentionality depending on the form of the couplings, we can always pick a representation where all variables are put into dimensional form, that is a phase space, and that can be generalized for all kinds of analog systems, or we can reduce the properties depending on a dimension in space to a different property in a lower dimensional space. It is complicated to explain in detail in this comment, but i intend to explain it in general form at a later date, for now it seems sufficient to say that it is possible, variable charge for example can be substituted for location on a single direction of space in a simple theory with charged point particles with simple potentials.

I thought these strigs are just about the gravity/Quantum gravity , ... not as ahh... .
Is , Tsquared/m or m/t2 , a simplified version of Isaac Newton&#39;s equation for gravity?<br> Or is it the measurement or mass over T squared .<br>To find out how it is moving,speed, direction and all that.<br>It has been plaguing my mind. Hate to say i know nothing about this stuff. I just have been having weird dreams about Einstein writing things down. Saying it will take generations to find out the exact mass, but once they have that. They will be able to know and show where each mass known thing in space will go. No matter the size.
Roman numerals are better for hand signals
What leads to the emergence of gravity in timespace?<br>can you have quantum gravity if gravity is a particle?
Unifying natures laws has to mean unifying biology and physics. Consider the notion that the Universe itself is &quot;living&quot;.
Think i remember hearing in a video that in order to see these strings, you&#39;d need a particle collider the size of our GALAXY.
&quot;Super symmetry has not been found in 99% of the phase space for discovery.&quot; It seems as if David Gross says this at minute 46, although it&#39;s somewhat garbled. If so, that mean there is an 99% change super symmentry is false and only 1% chance it is true. Many say string theory requires super symmetry. Then there is a 99% chance string theory is wrong.
Can you believe these eggheads get paid to talk nonsense all day
Didnt understand a word but the animations were sick üî•
Hope we find proof of strings soon, want to know more!
Everytime someone says we&#39;ve reached the end or we know just about everything about the universe... we end up learning we know almost nothing

Me in an armchair listening to Brian Greene, two Nobel Prize winners and a Fields Medal winner discuss the foundations of reality.
Make the microscope bigger and bigger, and you get smaller and smaller things. Make the telescope bigger and bigger and the universe runs away from you. No matter how smart the physicists, reality can never truly be known from the perspective of the mind. <br><br>Its rather significant that combining quantum physics with general relativity equations yield infinities. Instead of thinking of infinities as non-sensical, perhaps chasing non-infinite answers is non-sensical.
I really like this one.
I really like this one too
If only the Beatles had sung &quot;We all live in an Electron Field&quot; An Electron Field. And the Sky, it is not blue, thats just the way, it seems to me and you. As Sir Hubble said in 1936 We will look out to the Edges of the Universe and then when we can see no further, we will Dream and Imagine what is beyond what we can ever see. Never a truer word spoken. Such insight not only of of space and time but also human nature. David is and remains of course a true Scientist who seeks truth by gaining new measured knowledge. <br>But i have a Question that is also an Answer :- Are Black Holes Neutrons and Protons in Equilibrium. Thereby they emit nothing and only absorb matter that is reduced to Neutrons and Electrons at the Event Horizon, which is why we detect Gamma, X Ray and Radio waves from the event horizon and not the black hole itself. Quasars emit massive jets of matter when the event horizon gets overwhelmed. This is clear evidence this matter is not absorbed by the Quasar but ejected by the Super Massive Black Hole. Or maybe the Bach Hole lol.
Love this panel!  Amazing.
There is a 99% chance super string theory is wrong. All four of these top physicists in the world, sitting right there admit it straight out, but they say it in such a roundabout way that it sound like they are saying it is right. At minute 46, Nobel Laureate David Gross says super symmetry has not been found in 99% of the phase space for discovery. This occurred at the 10 billion dollar CERN LHC. Nobel Laureate David Gross, with the white hair sitting on the right, says that their one and only primary theory, super string theory, that they all have spent the past 40 year working on has a 99% chance of being wrong. <br><br>The dependence of string theory on super symmetry has been stated clearly by quite a number of the most respected authors. They are even merged into a single phrase, super string theory. With the failure of super symmetry, Nobel Laureate David Gross now does a biiiiiiiiiig hand wave emphatically stating there is no connection whatever between super symmetry and string theory. So which is it? Does string theory require super symmetry or not? Maybe Gross is just sticking up for fellow club member Witten, Mr. String Theory.<br><br>String theory has failed. Super symmetry has failed. The LHC has failed. Defund physics.
Have the mass of the electron been calculated in string theory?
U mean it doesn&#39;t weigh 5kg ?<br>üò≥ü•¥
As much as Lord Kelvin was wrong, String theorists are wrong, too. What causes strings to vibrate? What are their internal dynamics?
what was Einstein&#39;s definition of insanity again...
Safe to assume many will have pointed this out but Roman numerals are more easily added if using an abacus than arabic numerals.

Unifying Nature&#39;s Laws is not possible without fully understanding the real true nature of gravity. Quantum Gravity is real. We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical laws and physical/mathematical equations that are predictive and precise. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement in Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE or alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA.
Such a riveting conversation! The expedition from pursuing a unified theory to grappling with the amalgamation of quantum mechanics and general relativity proves to be genuinely captivating. String theory, in its endeavor to unite particles through oscillating strings, introduces a distinctive outlook to the quest. Eagerly anticipating further profound insight.
String theory is on life support.
What if we as humans can only theorize the complexity.  What if it took the combination of AI to fully encompass what is beyond our capacity to ever be able to fully comprehend the inter-workings of the unified universe.  Like we can see the framework.   But can never understand the complexity.
Great people, great panel but did I understand correctly that we somehow achieved to measure, without any doubt, what happens inside or outside a black hole and prove Hawkins, Quantum theory and string theory, all together? They are sure great but are they serious?
There are no physical laws. The only true fact of nature that resembles a law is karma, the production of consequences by non-ideal choices.
Uncertainty is the best theory, like choosing the best shape of a snowflake .
Would have been great to hear Witten speak a little bit more than the few times he did, but all in all a great panel.
I feel like these physicists have been stringing us on for decades.

First of all why strings

Why do people always cross their legs in situations like this?
I play a string instrument, so I am very familiar with the behavior of a vibrating string and its various parts. The analogy  between a string and quantum fields is nothing but intriguing and it is reminiscent of Pythagoras and the music of the spheres!
Chemical shift and J Coupling of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, could be affected by heavy nucleous (relativitic effects) it Is discussed in a Lot of papers. It woyld be a very tiny space, so it seems appopriaty to test string theory.
Dr. Greene and dr. Kaku pushing this pretty much dead theory just for the sake of pushing it. What they want is to get the single theory of everything so called God equation, pretty much is a dead end and still on many pages, probably never get the E = mc2.
Maybe find a bunch of older more boring guys to discuss this? üòÇ
really enjoyed this. thank you.
Maybe there&#39;s a dimension for every particle? If they&#39;re like molds then whenever a string enters one, it exits as a particular type of particle. Maybe? <br>I imagine that time isn&#39;t one dimension, not a 4th dimension but the expansion of the three space dimensions we are familiar with. If the expansion rate is relative to gravity, then time is relative to the observer&#39;s position in a gravity well.  That could explain the arrow of time. <br>What has been suggested as the source of the invisible dimensions and what ties them together? Are they a product of some twisted strings? <br>Oh-oh, I have just imagined it all behaving like a DNA that produces space and matter instead of the molecules of life. <br>I have officially gone nuts .
Here is something to chew on.<br>We are quite certain that Spacetime is a real ‚ÄúThing‚Äù<br>Why?<br>Because It seems to tell Matter how to move and if something hits it hard enough it reacts.<br>It shakes.<br>That is about the end of our knowledge about it as far as I can tell.<br>Except for this small additional fact.<br>It is probably the foundation of everything in our Universe.<br>Here is what you may want to chew on.<br>What if Spacetime is self-aware???<br>String Theory would have you believe that the Foundation of everything is  tiny tiny vibrating strings.<br>So what if those strings were connected in such a way that they became self-aware?<br>This could mean that all the other ‚Äústuff‚Äù that we can investigate is merely ‚Äúnoise‚Äù  created by a self-aware Spacetime trying to understand what ‚Äúit‚Äù is. <br>Such an Entity may look at us as just a ‚Äúfailed experiment‚Äù on its path to understanding.

The discussions of the senior physicists facilitated by WSF are so informative and will encourage many potential  the young  physicists to think. I teach classical Indian philosophy - trained in the non-dual world view and have ventured into interdisciplinary studies - especially quantum physics. Though being outside science, I can only depend upon what the scientists have discovered and have discovered. But I have learned so many things from modern  physicists. I really thank the World Science Festival for what I have been learning. Philosophers are trained holistic things and sub-texts hidden among consistent or inconsistent data of science. I haven&#39;t yet heard anything which can go beyond what Advaita&#39;s Pure Existence- Consciousness- Bliss (developed in the 7th century by Sankara in Kerala, India)  reflected in the joy felt by great mathematicians and path breaking scientists when they have discovered new truths
These are old men on the panel who burnt a lot of public&#39;s money for a nice lifestyle,  and now have nothing to give back in return to society .

Advaita is the study of the subject, and science is the study of object, so of course you need both as long as you are in the waking reality.

Whatever is the nature of the truth observed by the top scientists beyond or of Dark Matter/Dark Energy or these are what have been observed so far in relation to String Theory along with Super Symmetry, where will the concerned physicists fit their own subjective act of being observers into what they have observed so far ? Will the Anthropic Principle have anything with this question?
You are only talking about the Outward Directed observation without referring to the internal epistemic phenomenon of the observer. You have only two options as answers: Either it is the physical brains of the Scientists or ontologically real (mind or consciousness/self as the source of the intentional acts as thinker or observer (derivation from the father of phenomenology - Edmund Husserl - originally a mathematician who became an influential philosopher who changed the modern western philosophy)
String theory is wrong. I still see no preoccupation that it is right.
You want a testable theory? üòÆ
Try CIG Theory
String Theory has made an amazing contribution to mathematics and therefore indirectly to Physics too which can use it as a toolkit for who knows what in the future. However as a Theory of Everything candidate (the only one so far it must be admitted) and in the absence of any actual distinctive experimental evidence after 50+ years of research by many, many highly talented physicists, doubt is creeping in even to the minds of many of the leading exponents and especially the funding institutions that this is the best way forward. String Theory was a giant leap to the end of the book of Physics and maybe we have to get there more slowly page by page, experiment by experiment, to truly comprehend what we read at the end (if there is one of course xD). String Theory may eventually be proved right but until then it cannot be disproved. The question is whether this is it&#39;s greatest strength or weakness.
,.. !
I find it interesting, though not necessarily of any real significance, that the dualities of the 5 string theories and the dualities of the 5 Platonic solids have a similar pattern:<br>String theory has 2 pairs that are dual to each other and one that is dual to itself, whereas the Platonic solids also have 2 pairs that are dual to each other and one that is dual to itself.
Roman numerals are good for clocks!
Time or more specifically ,a complete understanding of Time, is IMHO the most important thing to fully grasp. Without Time our Universe would cease to exist, to us. If Space somehow emerged at some instant and Time did not emerge at the same instant we would not be talking about the subject period. Think of it this way if you as, the established expert generator of all things decided to have a party and you invited everything except you left out Time your Party would be static ad-infinitum and boring beyond belief, and it would probably be the last time anyone asked you to hold a party.
Time is that which the clocks show. ;-)
Sometimes you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know.
Perhaps the reason it is so difficult to produce experimental verification of String Theory is because the extra dimensions that seem to be required are not Spatial Dimensions but are some variation of Time dimensions or a mixture of Spatial and Time dimensions. Each time I see an explanation of the required Extra  Dimension they are represented as Spatial in Nature. If a Vibrating String is the supposed foundation of all things then perhaps it would be worthwhile exploring the fact that a vibrating string is not only vibrating in Space but also must be vibrating through Time as well. So perhaps this fact may also also explain, in part, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. If Time itself is quantifiable then maybe this fact along with the interaction with Space at the quantum level would yield the answer we seek. perhaps.
fuck they are full of shit
Brian Green is one of the heroes of Scientific Free Speech
This is wonderful! So happy to see everyone enjoying themselves. Exciting to see Ed Witten so animated. Thank you.
Evolution is magical thinking üéâ
When they say &quot;its consistent with our physics&quot; that is a bit of a fib - its only consistent in a simpler (&quot;toy&quot;) spacetime that is not our spacetime at all, and there is NO mechanism for &quot;inherent mass&quot; so all its resultant &quot;particles&quot; travel at the speed of light and can never actually interact/scatter to make a universe -  thus that vague comment about &quot;problems with the Higgs sector&quot; ? Fun math though, for sure.
That there is no such thing as &quot;inherent mass&quot; is a consequence of relativity. What travels at the speed of light are causality and energy. There are no particles in physics. That&#39;s just poorly chosen wording.
Light can take a long time to get here due to congestion.

It&#39;s amazing the level of mental acrobatics these guys are willing to do in order to make string theory seem like a major achievement on par with newtonian mechanics and quantum mechanics. Especially from Brian Greene, it never stops. For everything they claim string theory does, they have to add in 5 caveats to explain why in practice it&#39;s not feasible or possible to do precisely in the real world,  it smells real funky when you start digging into it.
You are missing a point here.<br>Atm. String theory can potentially answer all questions of this universe, but there is atm. no way of test this.<br>So, the value of string theory atm. is the many good minds, directed towards it, developing new maths and geometrical tools, that can be applied elsewhere !<br>The treasue chest they are trying to open, may be emty, but the lockpicking tools, can be used to open other chests !
@zash5598 If it&#39;s not verifiable it&#39;s not a real theory. There were many times when mathematics lead physicists astray. That&#39;s why multiverse from inflation always will be just an interesting idea for sci-fi authors.
in other words,  Carlo Rovelli has a point?
@@FABRIZIOZPH why are you mentioning Carlo Rovelli here? What kind of point had he made? If it was about string theory then he was probably right but he himself is working on for now unproven theory of gravity (one prediction that LQG made was disproven). Although I support him much more than string theorists.
‚Äã@zash5598the mathematical models show how the developers of the model think the world is, even more, how they would like the world to be. It&#39;s sort of a phantasy as long as it cannot be tested in the  real world.
@zash5598 First of all you stated:<br>&quot;probably particles are something we cannot conceive through reality only mathamatics&quot;<br>wrong, LHC begs to differ. We definitely can and are conceiving particles on a daily basis, through all those experiments that are conducted. Even quarks that cannot live as a free particle are found during inelastic scattering of protons. We can see that proton has internal structure. So they are not just mathematical figment of imagination.<br>And if what is never verified? String theory or LQG? Either way till we can verify it it won&#39;t be legitimate theory like Standard Model (although this is more of a framework than theory) or general relativity. There are some ways to experimentally test string theory without going to energy scale on a planck energy level (which we never wil be able to do). Ok, never maybe too strong word but not in a forseeable future. I just have a problem with all those string theorists that they treat this mathematic framework as something almost verified (Michio Kaku said that). That&#39;s why I love the title of Sabine Hossenfelder&#39;s book &quot;Lost in math&quot;. What&#39;s more we don&#39;t have one coherent string theory, you have all this landscapes with 2^500 possibilities of how those Calabi-yau can fold with those 6 dimensions but they resolve this with multiverse;).

I understood maybe 10% of this conversation. yet i remain fascinated.
The beauty of string theory is that we as humans are driven and forced to measure and unify all forces of nature into one coherent theory of quantum gravity. However, we don‚Äôt know if time is frame by frame or continuous with gradation. More accurately is time cyclical in nature? üòé or are we just being deceived and are embedded into this 3+1 holographic projection  from a Spacetime one dimension lower like a hologram projected from a surface infinitely far away. We can only detect the observable universe of an event horizon from a flat, 2d hologram projecting a 3d illusion. If time also doesn‚Äôt exist (an illusion due to it being reversible) then we take ‚Äòtime‚Äô out of the equation when we collapse a moment to observe a particle in 3d as if it was a singularity. We could entirely be measuring the wrong thing ü§î The only thing that is real is the complexity of our own human minds or consciousness being finite and constantly interacting (entangled) with other particle fields as in unison. We know that Spacetime is an emergent phenomenon from a prior subquantum medium (2D hologram or black hole with intricate strings) and that entanglement can be explained in terms of a nonlinear relation between space and time that is imposed by subquantum waves. We as observers are the agents of collapsed events. This reflects on a very deep existential question in philosophy - ‚ÄòI think therefore I am‚Äô. The conscious mind is separate and irreversible. All else is cyclical, an illusion and reversible.

Ok, so in other words we don&#39;t really know any of it is right. I understand the small importance of it . But isn&#39;t mire important to fix the issue in our planet.
String Theory is pseudo-science at best, a scam at worst. String Theory is nothing more than a wishful thinking conjecture that &quot;M-theory&quot; exists. A magical theory that somehow conjures up a unique set of parameters that exactly matches our laws of physics. String theory is theology. Nothing to see here. Shameful! Another example of &quot;Trust the science&quot; being used by charlatans.<br>- Jim Eadon MSc Quantum Opto-electronics (Physics).
Summary: String Theory is Dead and isn&#39;t even a testible scientific theory.
Is string theory compatible with quantum field theory? Seems important to me.
Now this is how you launder money.

Hello <br>thank you for keeping me upto date about the science news. We know that in olden days, passing information was difficult but quality was there and now it is easy but quality of information is bad. This is one of the reason why many people that we would like to contact ignore messages. Especially if it&#39;s lengthy. As time changes new methods had to be adopted.  So, hello viewers. I know you all are science lovers. So there is a  pdf file I attached in the video description. Don&#39;t subscribe, don&#39;t like. You can comment if you want. I&#39;m not trying to make money here. It&#39;s a small science work that I done. I&#39;m sure if it didn&#39;t amaze you it will sure make you laugh. Please go through it.
This is not important it&#39;s only a fucking idea theoretical physicist God damn if their wasn&#39;t a more pointless job
Modern science is not aware of the &quot;INNER SPACE&quot;, where the Information is processed.  We need to approach truth from the Mind of the Heart and its five extension that is connected to the Inner Space. The Inner space is Conscious space. This Inner space can connect to the  Outer Universal Conscious field that bind everything into One- her comes the important ancient East, especially India.
Imagination is Important. Vision and Conceptualization is important to know Truth  - The Matths is secondary. I am correct Kurt Godel did speak of the limitation to know Truth of Nature,  East understood this long back as they Transcended the mind and stressed on Experiencing. Modern Physics largely uses sight and sound  as tool to understand nature.  The most important of the 5 sense is the skin, that experience. Both the Inside and Out side of it. --
look Depp In to Life. The Truth of Life exist not in Genes but between the Genes that bind them and sustains
Sting theory has potentials - But it has first visualize how particle manifest in string, wave and Vice-verse
In Nature  there  nothing called perfect Straight Line, circle, square  this is our imagination and our quest to catch the spirit God into a mathematical Bottle.
I am hoping the &#39;AI&#39; to to integrate bring out the simplicity behind the complexity physicist have made
Give up mathematics, First visualize particle  Transforming into a String and wave and back to Particle. - Imagination is Importnat
First we need to answer wave particle duality first in simple comprehensible way
Conceptually this is addressed in &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot; on LinkedIn
Why because we are obsessed  with predictability.  We are obsessed with symmetry. We are failing to go back to nature and look deep into life. The universe is quantum entangled. Life works on quantum entanglement. It works in fusion technology.  Transcend the mind and go deep into life  .
Nature is simple. Physicists  have made it complex. Forget predictability
Some day we would see that gravity and inertial mass s not the same. This notion comes from the quest to visualize everything from a symmetrical point. Nature and life are asymmetrical

Don&#39;t we have enough of this string theory BS already? Give it a rest Brian !  There was over 200 years between Newton and Einstein. There will be another 100 years before we will see another Einstein.
Even though I&#39;m bad at mathematics, I still try to imagine according to the emerging space-time way of thinking:<br>+ Dimensions outside the 3 dimensions of space are the dimensions of scalar fields.<br>+ Take a visual example like the electromagnetic field - which is an emerging field of quantum mechanical phenomena. The oscillation frequency of electromagnetic waves originates from the oscillation of the source, regardless of what the source is.<br>+ What is energy? Energy is contained in vibrations.<br>In spacetime, E = h.f.<br>f is something related to time.<br>h is a characteristic constant of spacetime.<br>+ 1 energy at a point in space-time must vibrate in another dimension. E = h&#39;.f&#39; with f&#39;=h&#39;.C&#39;/Œª&#39;. C&#39; and Œª&#39; are measures of the &quot;length&quot; and duration of the dimension.<br>+ A point in high-dimensional space cannot contain energy because the energy must be contained in waves.<br>Some comments like that.
Entanglement is a wormhole, so the proper geometry is not a linear string but a N-torus - an N dimensional string with a girdle whose measure is the entire universe in the entangling event&#39;s light cone history.  It is an N-torus because eventually the entanglement will resolve.  The energy required to open the wormhole shows up as gravitation.  Spacetime is flat where the entanglements are uniformly distributed, essentially pulling in all directions uniformly.  Localized collections of as-yet-unresolved entanglements appear as gravitational wells.   The &quot;mass of a particle&quot; is related to the energy of the entanglement when the particle pair was created.  This suggests a quantum origin for gravity.  Every event is essentially an event horizon separating the entire universe from its existence on either side of the event, leaving a wormhole of unreconciled entanglement. Space arises out of the process of such reconciliation, which is a network of interconnected N-tori.
None of these 4 quantum magicians considers the option that we should first understand the origin of the quantum.
i have question: what exactly makes the calculations go into a mess.. why doesn&#39;t it make sense if you combine it? i would love to see such an calculation and what exactly is messy about it then - and also what if the answer is infinity?
Now go to the ‚Äò not even wrong ‚Äò website to see a proper critique of this video
Very interesting stuff.  If different string vibration modes are associated with fundamental particles how does this work when the strings appear to be many orders of magnitude smaller than particles? Can anyone explain this or point me to an explanation? Thanks.
I enjoyed listening to all, but Witten positively surprised me. He is always pleasantly concise and expert and has a good spirit.
And wrong.
String theory?  Lol.
i&#39;ll save everyone 90 minutes and tell you that the state of string theory is exactly where it was 30 years ago... no experiments, no predictions, no way to answer questions that we don&#39;t already have the answers to.... but DAMN is that math sexy!
String theory is too complex to reflect the reality of the universe. It&#39;s more of mathematical dream.
Very sorry to have attended this fiasco.   But I had to see them for myself.   I had hoped for much more than what I saw IRL which was a one sided review.    Were they objective:  absolutely not.
I think Roman Numerals has a use. Imagine you came across a Roman ruin &amp; the stone letters r all scattered, you have better chance of guessing the original number, either disarranged or even missing. As for Arabic #, the notation is too terse if stone suffered such a fate. The clumsy way of Roman sort of make it robust against this sort of assault. But i have no quantitative work to support, its just a hunch. Arabic # is great for precise and parsimonious computation and representation.
This discussion is unbelievably informative and entertaining.  Some of the greatest minds in this field.  It is reassuring to hear the greatest minds provide so much certainty but history proves that today‚Äôs certainty is tomorrow‚Äôs uncertainty and the day after‚Äôs different certainty.<br><br>I have existed on this planet for 3 score years and 10, so I can say this without fear of ageism accusations.  Brian Greene generally thinks the same thoughts that his guests do, and he really glues the discussion together.   BUT ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I would be really interested in the participants in the  discussion being challenged by some of the ‚Äúyoungsters‚Äù in the ‚Äúfield‚Äù.   There must be a new generation of physicists coming through who will develop existing theories and produce new truths.  I am not sure I am ready to believe the youngster‚Äôs new truths but I would like to hear their challenges.
Dear God, you must be an American.
There are no challengers because they have to keep their mouth shut and have to praise these old men on the stage for their failures.
Science is handicapped by the Hubris of our scientists.<br>Provide a place for the layperson to submit papers and within a year science would explode with new and novel ideas and directions of study.
What a complete panel of bullshit mathematics. These guys are inebriated with a monster they created that doesnt exist.
the &#39;emergence&#39; of spacetime is extremely interesting. The first question is emergence from what? Also, the term emergence underlies the concept of time (past=no spacetime -&gt; now is spacetime). Space and time are two different things from the start. Space as we know it is conceived with the concepts of left, right, top and bottom.Time as we know it is based on past and future and has this arrow or direction. So how about this: fundamental space and time have no directions but are somehow entangled &#39;cells&#39; or fundamental units of directionless space and time (kind of randomly distributed for a lack of better description), and the &#39;emergence&#39; is the manifestation of an orientation of space and time that gives rise to what we know of them in our daily life? And, I would even propose that the directionless space and time co-exists with their directed partners. Throwing few ideas...
A++++. An excellent discussion on the progress of physics from way back up to now.  Bravo on the ingenuity with the slides to help visualize these complex subjects in a way that truly shows what is behind the math.
There has been no progress in string theory whatsoever, other than ruling out more and more of this theory
Nice to hear string theory came from a stand still.
and with lowering the constant from that notorious formula to right amount of speed of light, the mirror universe begins to shape form
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjDxk9ZnYJQ&amp;t=455">7:35</a> LoL
Only half way through. Wow, just wow. The panel. Dr. Greene‚Äôs mastery at leading a talk. The economy of language. The graphics. The respect each panelist has for the other panelist., and the humility to not jump ahead. Thank you so much for doing the this. Just Wow.
So... I wonder if, in the first 380,000 years time was able to travel both ways. And the microwave background is implied by potential differences.
it is really the greatest achievement of physics.......... the standard model
It was a great talk about good to go into some details. However, I wish Brian would have invited some critics of String Theory, like Neil Turok to counter act the A+ given by  the supporters of String Theory to give the audience a more nuanced picture.
I was thinking the same thing.
Ah, but that might make some viewers critical of string theory, which might threaten his grant money! And he can&#39;t have that, since hype and book deals are the only thing keeping the corpse of a failed theory alive.
That would have made for a much more interesting discussion, for sure.
Sabine Hossenfelder would certainly have provided the needed counterbalance.
String theory is not science and doesn&#39;t belong on this channel
Says some random dude on Youtube
Once again, String THEORY is dead end maths, not a description or explanation of the universe. Actual scientists need to tell the fringe math obsessed physicists to keep their unprovable theories in their insulated maths echo chamber
Says someone wirh a math knowledge that ends at subtracting fractions

String theory is a hallucination. This is an electric universe.  Check out the Thunderbolts Project.
Is gravity a product of spacetime and the quantum realm a product of the singularity outside of spacetime? Are they operating under different criteria? The answer is yes, so this IS your answer.

Here‚Äôs an anecdotal philosophical suggestion regarding the debated existence/influence of ‚ÄúTime.‚Äù Could the accounting of time in point of fact represent a needlessly imposed artificial metric, where what is actually happening is that physical processes are responding to known (or theoretical) causal influence, and occurring in relative relationship to one another while moving through their causal/entropic path. Where, as these physical processes occur in relative relationship to one another, we assign the value of time to that relativity, but that value is in actuality an artificial non-physical non-causal distinction. What happens then, when the non-physical non-causal imposed abstraction of time is removed from equations? Otherwise considered, what happens when the potential liability of time is deprioritized from equations. P.S. Please forgive the unqualified nature of this contribution, however, human relationships with time historically demonstrate anthropocentric projection.
Spoiler alert: String Theory is dead.
Spoiler alert. You are wrong. The opposite is true üòÇ
Have you seen the work of Dunning and Kruger?
Great forum. One of your best .
Pretty Zen.
Absolutely wonderful discussion and thanks to the panel for taking the time to communicate their work. Thanks to the moderator, I feel very grateful
Definitely an assembly of some  inspirational names within the scientific community. <br>   Unifying Relativity and QFT have met roadblocks within the community and have been stuck there for quite some time, fundamentally due to the inability to recognize the underlying mechanisms in nature connecting them. While both theories generate accurate predictions individually, they both have missing elements and incorrect details of mechanisms that actually exist in nature and how they are connected.<br>   Maths can explain many things in nature. They can also produce results that aren&#39;t observed or simply don&#39;t exist in nature. String theory for example, IMO while it may work to a degree mathematically, has some fundamentally wrong assumptions that simply don&#39;t correspond to how nature actually works. The same can be said for Einstein&#39;s general relativity as well as other models and theories.<br>    There definitely are answers to how these phenomenon coexist in nature, however, I&#39;m concerned the answers (the keys to the universe) will unlock abilities and responsibilities that humanity simply isn&#39;t ready for.<br>    Most people are driven to make discoveries and acquire knowledge to attain some personal recognition, wealth, notoriety, security etc. While others try to possess/control certain knowledge to exploit for personal gain/power/control over others. Few have the experience/wisdom/consideration to understand and care what happens in the wake of their pursuits/discoveries beyond what benefit it is for them. Most go a lifetime without it.  I believe knowledge of the magnitude we are discussing here should be considered in this way.<br>   When we can rise above the cycle of greed, corruption, inequality, hate, prejudice, war, criminal behavior, and hubris,  I&#39;ll give you these answers for free.
Just because we would like to have a unified theory it doesn&#39;t mean there is one. Anyhow is string theory flexible enough to explain the physics of other universes?
Yes it is. There are .... wait for it .... 10^500 different valid solutions to the equations of string theory , each one of them representing a different kind of universe. We just happen to live in one of them. Not all of these universes will be entirely viable though. Some may self destruct in a relatively short time, others may not support complex chemistry or life. So, not all universes are born equal. <br>This 10^500 figure does not represent how many universes there might be, but how many different <b>types</b> of universes there could be. It&#39;s an astounding prediction, which supports the idea of a multiverse in some form. After all, if there could be 10^500 different kinds of universe, why would there be only one? The problem with this theory is that it is not testable in any way, at least currently. Many people are very critical of theories which are &#39;unfalsifiable&#39;. A &#39;good&#39; theory, they say, makes predictions which can be tested.
&quot;Just because we would like to have a unified theory it doesn&#39;t mean there is one&quot; <br><br>That statement could be considered quite ironic, on many levels. It may be that we are not able to work this out, it may be forever beyond our reach, mostly perhaps because there are fundamental properties of nature that we cannot observe, detect or understand. But that is quite different from there &quot;not being any kind of universal fundamental foundations to reality&quot;. <br>I&#39;m sure most scientists would argue simply that &#39;there has to be&#39;. After all, quantum mechanics plays out on the same &#39;stage&#39; as spacetime; in fact, it depends on spacetime being there in the first place, so there has to be a fundamental connection between them. They both act out in the same universe. Because of this, they surely both must be built on the very same building blocks - the most fundamental and tiny building blocks that we can imagine. This is the only rational viewpoint. One might want to conjure up some fantastical ideas to imagine how the two things could simultaneously exist in the same universe, and yet not be fundamentally connected, but that would not make sense, it would require almost magical properties for our reality. The simplest explanation, is that there <b>is</b> a unified theory which will explain this, but it is, for the time being, just beyond our reach.
So.... nothing done then. 40 years, and String Theory hasn&#39;t produced anything, and produced no deeper understanding of the universe .Great job. What a brilliant set of minds, wasting theirs and everyone elses time.
Exactly. Hubris is wild isn‚Äôt it?
It is said that Witten once killed 3 people with just a pencil

Field monkeys! Try zero point. <br>Hirrmein is the logical theoretical cosmologist. You poeple are smack dab silly.<br>Alternative views include consciousness into the measurement of physics.  As Heizenburg principle considers. You people are so brainwashed.
That was an amazing discussion, with 4 people who have really, in their own way, contributed so much to the field of Physics. It was  a privilege to hear this discussion and a  special thanks to Brian Greene who is brining these topics into our living room and inspiring young people about the field.
Great discussion. Also, Brian Green picks exquisite outro music.
Great lecture. I think they‚Äôre right in saying there‚Äôs stuff that needs to be invented to take the concept further. Maybe some conclusive thought experiment that provides the proof needed.  The alternative is creating machine that needs the energy of a supernova to do the test, which is unrealistic.
Nothing has ever been scientifically proven by a thought experiment. There is no such thing as a conclusive thought experiment in science.
String theory is just another swindle that has nothing to do with the real world or real Physics!
Can someone explain how one can enjoy these topics even though he doesn&#39;t understand a word of what is said? It can&#39;t just be Brian Greene&#39;s almost peerless ability to facilitate the discussions.
Gawd.  How long is this guy is going to milk theory along??
I think its fair to say - we live in an amazing time. Thank you for sharing Earths collective understanding of natures laws for the masses!
But what they&#39;ve talked about are not a laws or nature in any way. For now string theory explains nothing. It is just a piece of nice looking mathematics.
If I were to guess, String Theory is a purposeful way to steer everyone off the real truth about physics.  Ed Wittens father figured out in the late forties when the government had him focus on gravity and unlocking it.  Ed Wittens fathers findings helped developed the machines they built Area 51 to house.  Our military doesn‚Äôt have alien tech.  We have harnessed a power using science under deep secrecy and String Theory is a way to draw people away from the truth.
WSF is great as always although I would like more string theory sceptics. Because all of them are connected with development of string theory that lead us nowhere. Peter Woit or Sabine Hossenfelder or even Roger Penrose would be great addition.
Waste of time to explain the background everytime.  98% off the watching this knows the history by now.
Sometimes I ponder the idea that the deepest, underlying nature of our universe is under no obligation to be probe-able by human primates. That is, we could have a correct theory that <i>is</i> in fact correct, but there&#39;s no possibility of humans or our descendants <i>ever</i> being able to test the theory.
Roman numerals are great for a movie&#39;s date in the credits.
now this is a proper discussion
What an august panel!
Even though its a great discussion,  one cannot hide from the fact that there is zero evidence for super symmetry or string theory or m-theory. Our great scientists are mincing words now, but the whole point behind building the LHC was to find evidence for susy particles for example. Other than the Higgs Boson nothing came out, which kind of puts the entire theroy to question. String theory has all the mathematical elegance but I feel either the interpretation is wrong or they are missing something fundamental.
Seems odd to me to attempt to understand the universe as vibrating strings without also rigorously investigating the concepts of harmonics and resonance as it applies to said strings. üßêü§∑üèº

How would you feel as a young black African girl who has discovered the theory of everything i.e that the theory is actually genius because its based on  real numbers fractions ,constants, imaginary numbers which perfectly coincides &amp; S.I units don&#39;t matter but your voice is suffocated because its supposed to be discovered by old white males from Princeton &amp; Havard because thats the framework of classism. Even Prof Einstein once said God doesn&#39;t roll dice if you take 183 pages to explain a concept then you definitely don&#39;t know what you are talking about . Science has become too monetized it has lost its soul to Corporate mafias.

Good move to have this discussion.  String Theory has been taking a lot of serious incoming lately.
There could only exist 3 types of particles characterizing the 3 life sustaining entities, PLANTS, ANIMALS and HUMANS, with 6 subtypes of each, corresponding to the 6 senses (including breathing as the COMMON, 6th. sense). And only one of the 3 types, the one that characterizes the humans, is interpretable as DIGITS with the 4 basic arithmetic operations as the only NATURAL laws of motion that rule all interactions among both others too. This excludes possibility of waves being fundamental or existence of nonmaterial entities of any kind. <br><br>As this enables programming own body of every person to release substances to the surrounding (exhaled air, urine, feces, sweat, tear,...) and act to influence unique growth on unique plants, effects of formulation of words and sentences would no more be arbitrary choice but results of calculations, hence &quot;at own risk&quot; if improper.<br><br>Lack of this knowledge is the reason why beings AGE. Our thoughts are rearrangements of particles in our body through continuous interactions with plants via breathing, and they influence our health.<br><br>That implies mathematics, languages and all the so called SOCIAL SCIENCES  would then be branches of GEOPHYSICS.<br><br>This earth is the only entity in the entire known universe, that delivers and sustains all life in it, hence its uniqueness  must be recognized, before rectifying the errors in the mechanism how it manufactures bodies of beings inside and delivers through plants to be assembled on its own surface, The Copernican Assumption of its motion is a blunder.<br><br>Michaelson Morley experiment ASSUMES the earth&#39;s motion, which is never physically proved, but only accepted as true, because the Copernican model&#39;s predictions are more  accurate than its predecessor, the Ptolemean model.<br><br>Hence, the assumption of the existence of luminiferous ether<br>becomes superfluous once the mtion of earth around the sun is placed in doubt. So the negative result of the experiment as to the relative motion of light simply meant that the earth doesn&#39;t move around the sun, rendering the STR totally unnecessary. <br><br>If we derive the mathematical model of the mechanism how the earth manufactures bodies of beings inside its bowels, develops PLANTS on its own surface to then deliver and sustain them (the beings) through the same plants, then we would be able to transfer all manufacturing processes, transport of goods and trade to be conducted inside the earth itself, using the raw materials and fuel existing there without extracting any of them to the surface. More importantly, we wouldn&#39;t need any robots or even any  human labour at all, as we would then be able to initiate growth on plants so that animals eat them to operate the process of bodies manufacturing inside as we plan.<br><br>Thus animals would be the labourers (= operating RCD ~ Remote Control Devices) and humans the designing RCD of the ONLY BODIES MANUFACTURING VESSEL in the entire known universe, THIS EARTH.<br><br>The reason why we suffer instead, building factories after extracting minerals and eating the nature given LABOUR FORCE ~ THE ANIMALS, is due to the 2 faulty assumptions by searchers of knowledge from antiquity to present day, from Thales of Miletus to Stephen Hawking:<br><br>1) there exists a system of LAWS OF NATURE to be discovered and obeyed, independent of whatever we ourselves do in it,<br><br>2) and that animals are created for us to eat. <br><br>Copernican asumption that the earth goes arond the sun and the 1st. law of thermodynamics that &quot;matter can neither be created nor destroyed&quot; prohibit even considering the possibility that this earth is the only bodies manufacturing vessel with its center FIXED IN SPACE AND GENERATING ELEMENTARY PARTICLES, whose presence in bodies of beibgs in unique threshold numbers is what enables each being to LIVE and when that number falls below the given threshold the being dies.<br><br>Both above assumptions currently believed to be absolute  truth by all on this earth, with the single exception (of yours truly) is extremely destructive as it prohibits the only possibility how a particle physical explanation with a practically implementable by us mathematical model can be derived to sustain life function on this earth eternally, starting with the present generation itself.<br><br>That center of the earth is fixed in space is provable by deriving the method to practically PREVENT all evil (predation, disasters, diseases ~ which include all violence ~ and death) by influencing plants, instead of the current criterion of proof, viz. PREDICTIONS tallying with results of experiments and/or observations, which doesn&#39;t guarantee the LAWS OF NATURE so concluded won&#39;t cause new harms to life function, let alone prevent the already existing ones.<br><br>Prevention of evil is not found even in the vocabulary of TEOS (The Experimental and Observational Science).

Incredible that we can watch this all over the world on Youtube.. I wish more people spent their time caring about stuff like this.
No problem, we&#39;re getting unified y&#39;all... LOL!
Dr Witten won the Fields Medal???!!<br>WOW
Isn&#39;t the supposed randomness in quantum theory just a gap in knowledge? That a theory is applicable in certain calculations, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s a flawless theory.
I&#39;m still &#39;neutral&#39; when it comes to string theory, but the one thing I like about it is that the theory works with strings that are 10‚àí35 meters - which is in the Planck length neighbourhood (1.6 x 10-35 meters). Whereas CERN collider works at 10-18 meters! The other interesting thing about String Theory, in my opinion,  is that it shows that theory tends to come before practice, at least when it comes to science.
Maybe it&#39;s the wrong path after all...? CERn as well as string theory? I hope for new generations of scientists who  hopefully will be less  less conceited, less dogmatic, less of a salesman, but much more of real highest-profile scientists like Einstein indeed was one ...
&quot; it shows that theory tends to come before practice&quot; it took 50 years to confirm Higgs boson so yeah, it takes time. But regarding string theory I have very little confidence that it will be validated. First of all energies required to test this are so big that we won&#39;t be able to create collider big enough to get there. And then many ideas from ST looks nice on paper (ADS/CFT, holographic principle) but have little to do with reality.
This is beautiful. I learned so much.
I love when scientists/professors talk about particles and miracles as if they are trying to crack a code. It‚Äôs easy; code=Gods plan.

A+ Brian A+ loved every minute of this. You&#39;re banging on the door of God&#39;s domain. Will we be let in? In Time. I believe so.
Thank you for the most inspiring popular science conversation.
proponents of string theory have been saying there&#39;s a big breakthrough around the corner in another 10 years- every 10 years- for the last 30 something years.
This was too short and I was hoping for more detail, about the current research, not repeating the, although very important, stuff from the last century.
Well, the WSF is making much more sense to humankind than the WEF did/does, but in handling the truth there seem to be parallels. We&#39;re supposed to own nothing and be happy there, and we are promised (dogmatic) solutions of everything (we have to be happy with) here. Unfortunately for them, at least our universe is dS and AdS/CFT duality seemingly needs repair, like QM did in order to describe what there really is. My gut feel is that hyperbolicity - induced via impact of hyperbolic components of connectedness loci in nonlinear complex iteration theory - might grant an exotic approach. Strings then being kind of Julia set fractals which look like point particles, seen from far away. And intrinsic (coupled) iterations allowing for periodic, chaotic and fluctuating phenomena...
This is a revelatory discussion. As a layman i understand that half have right over left legs crossed/ half left over right. 50% have ties/ 50% have no ties. Gotta love the.........duality. I think the attraction of ties towards each other needs a research paper at the very least.
Can you transform the AdS/CFT duality to the Universes spacetime?
beautiful minds on display. thank you
Great respect for these great scientists and learning from them. although I am not a big fan of String theory.
&quot;... a unified theory ... a theory that would describe all forces, all matter from  one consistent, coherent perspective ...&quot; According to Pavel Kroupa, the Lambda-CDM model is now ruled out by empirical evidence. Please google &quot;pavel kroupa dark matter&quot;. Consider six conjectures: 1. Einsteinian causality is string theory with Fredkin&#39;s finite nature hypothesis + some simplifying assumptions. 2. String vibrations are approximately confined to 3 copies of the Leech lattice (explaining why there are 3 generations of fermions). 3. Gravitational energy is not conserved ‚Äî Gravity Probe B&#39;s ultra-precise gyroscopes actually worked correctly &amp; confirmed¬†the speculation that<br>dark-matter-compensation-constant = (3.9¬±.5) * 10^‚Äì5 ‚Äî thus giving a relativistic model for MOND&#39;s empirical successes. 4. Some gravitons have spin slightly &gt; 2 (explaining dark matter). 5. Some gravitons have spin slightly &lt; 2 (explaining dark energy). 6. Unless string theorists realize that Milgrom is the Kepler of contemporary cosmology, they are guaranteed to fail. Am I deluded? Google &quot;milgrom lestone koide&quot;.
3, 4, 5 are new, how do they work?<br><br>2 - maybe you mean three copies of E8 lattice - the Leech lattice is the 24-dimensional one... Any idea how one of these lattices corresponds to one generation?
‚Äã@@MitchellPorter2025 : My guess is that in string theory with the infinite nature hypothesis E8 plays an important role, but in string theory with the finite nature hypothesis there is an essential role for the monster group, the 6 pariah groups, and the Leech lattice. Conjecture: string theory with Fredkin&#39;s finite nature hypothesis implies that during each Planck time interval precisely one unit of Fredkin-Wolfram energy is transferred from the boundary of the multiverse into the interior of the multiverse. All of the measurable universes occur on the boundary of the universe ‚Äî the interior of the multiverse consists entirely of non-measurable, virtual energy. The multiverse, though finite, can  be approximated by string vibrations that create a 72-dimensional network with 64 dimensions of virtual particle paths, 3 dimensions of linear momentum, 3 dimensions of angular momentum, 1 dimension of graviton spin, &amp; 1 dimension of non-measurable Fredkin uncertainty. The 3 copies of the Leech lattice allow Wolfram&#39;s cosmological automaton to work. The 64 dimensions of virtual particle paths collapse into 16 dimensions of quantum uncertainty, reducing  by symmetry to 10 dimensions for Einstein&#39;s field equations. In order for this scheme to work, the Friedman model needs to be replaced by the Riofrio-Sanejourand model, &amp; the inflaton field needs to be replaced by a deflaton field. The idea is that our universe is not expanding ‚Äî instead, the observers with their associated reference frames are shrinking. There are 6 basic quarks because there are 6 pariah groups. The only particles that need to be added to the Standard Model are the graviton, the axion, and the deflaton.  The scheme also needs the Koide formula &amp; Lestone&#39;s theory of virtual cross sections + 3 modifications of Einstein&#39;s field equations. Google &quot;Einstein&#39;s field equations: 3 criticisms&quot;.
5.) Shouldn‚Äôt quantum spin numbers come in increments of +¬Ω / -¬Ω
@@DavidBrown-om8cv OK, well, I&#39;d say Koide yes, Milgrom yes, the rest no. But let&#39;s talk about some of this. <br><br>First of all, making sense of your 72-dimensional grid. The way I think of it, the &quot;3 dimensions of linear momentum&quot; could be a Fourier transform of the 3 dimensions of observable macroscopic space; and the 64-reduced-to-16-reduced-to-10 dimensions could be a kind of &quot;metric bundle&quot; over those first 3 dimensions, that encodes a metric for a 4d space-time. I assume the remaining 5 dimensions also form a kind of vector bundle of properties associated to each 3d point, though what those properties mean is increasingly unclear - what is it that has the 3 values of angular momentum? how can graviton spin be anything but 2? and I don&#39;t know at all what &quot;Fredkin uncertainty&quot; could be. Also, it doesn&#39;t seem that any of your 72 dimensions can be identified with time, so it looks like the 72-dimensional grid as a whole is what evolves in time. <br><br>You don&#39;t say what the relation between the strings and the grid is. Do the strings move in the spaces between the grid points? Or are they chains of adjacent grid points that are all active (since you talk about cellular automata)? Is your idea specifically that there is a cellular automaton whose cells are the grid points? <br><br>Do the pariah groups show up as symmetries of the strings? Is each quark a different kind of string? What do you do for the leptons and gauge bosons?
@@twt2718 According to accepted quantum filed theory (QFT),  boson spin  has an integral value &amp; fermion spin has a half-odd-integer value. However, my guess is that QFT slightly fails for gravitons.
@@DavidBrown-om8cv Let‚Äôs say gravitons are discovered, and experimental evidence shows they don‚Äôt have exactly spin-2‚Ä¶ <br>and it doesn‚Äôt vary by exactly ¬±¬Ω. Say it‚Äôs slightly less or more than 2. Would the entire standard model need to be reworked? Or would this be a new theory of gravity that replaces GR?
@@twt2718 The. Standard Model (SM) is supported by overwhelming empirical evidence so the specifics of gravitons would not mean much change for the SM. However, it seems likely that gravitational energy is conserved if and only all gravitons have spin 2. If gravitational energy is not conserved, then GR would have to be at least somewhat modified ‚Äî it would be a conceptual revolution.
As a fan of WSF, I am very disappointed with this episode. People who do not understand physics may get the impression that string theory is right. It would be fair to include someone with other opinion and talk more about the failure of string theory and how is not a physical theory at all, but just a mathematical framework.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjDxk9ZnYJQ&amp;t=4920">1:22:00</a>. Root cause analysis.<br>The fundamental difference between inertia forces and ordinary forces of interaction of bodies is that for inertia forces it is impossible to specify the action of which specific bodies on a material point they describe, they cannot be confused with the Dalembert force of inertia, and they are always external forces. (Newton&#39;s first law is not a special case of Newton&#39;s second law.) GR reduced gravity to inertia by generalizing the first law: the free movement of test bodies occurs along geodesic lines, but the theory did not find out anything new about the nature of the cause of inertia forces. &quot;... the complete geometrization established by GR introduces a hierarchized cosmos on the plane, indicating indirectly the presence of an elusive source.&quot; (Tonnelat). It seems that this source of external (external) inertia forces is an &quot;absolute vacuum&quot; - instead of Newtonian &quot;absolute space&quot;, which &quot;... as a cause, does not satisfy the need for a causal explanation.&quot; (Born). Finally, the search for the root cause became possible after Friedmann spoke for the first time in a scientific way about the &quot;creation of the world&quot;, and even then there was an opportunity to abandon the a priori nature of the law (more precisely, the axiom) of inertia, and build physics on a more reliable basis.

It&#39;s hard to imaging how Green is still pushing this nonsense. The possibilities are infinite had not those thousands of brilliant minds over the past 30 years been forced to choose between string theory and a career outside of Physics. What a shame. At least Carrol has been apologizing (in his own arrogant way) over the past few years. Green and Witten will take those &quot;what the bleep&quot; special effect videos to their grave. And Whitten?  He likely could have solved a TOE himself but he would rather entertain himself with the never-ending and  beautiful mathematical proofs string theory encourages, produces, and requires. My money is on Wolfram, he will be regarded as the next Einstein IMO.

The derived Planck Units appear to be inviolate. Since strings define the granularity of our existence, and each string may be confined to a unit defined by Planck limits, the information density of our existence must be mind-boggling... Every unit of Planck defined volume/time carries more than a single bit of information. Maybe an entire timeline of information. &#39;Twould be interesting to read the Science-fiction fantasies of present day luminary physicists, and mathematicians.

Brian Green should have taken Anirban into the group as he is the best authority on strings, proving vibration as the essence of consciousness. In the process Anirban finds a universal role of primes.<br>Einstein , as far as I know, never claimed to be looking for a &#39;theory of everything&#39;. In the EPR paper he claimed neutral particles won&#39;t lead to singularity, which is produced by charged particles. Einstein was smart enough to know that knowing everything was impossible, as Anirban.

I find it odd that when discussing Einstein&#39;s General Theory of Gravity, in which spacetime is curved by matter, we still view matter as a solid objects.  It reminds me of the traditional view of the atom, a la Niels Bohr, in which we  view electrons orbiting a solid nucleus of protons and neutrons.  We now know of course that these &#39;particles&#39; are really just concentrated perturbations in fields, and not static points.  In pursuit of a unified theory, doesn&#39;t it make sense then to view &#39;objects&#39; like planets and stars as nothing more than concentratated  perturnbations of fileds?  Yes, larger and more complex concentrations to be sure, but if we now view the universe as a tripartite spacetimematter system, the mathematical equations, which I admittedly am not capable of expounding, whould emerge?‚Äã
I‚Äôve heard different physicists say spacetime (especially time) might be an emergent phenomenon, instead of a fundamental phenomenon. I think when quantum computing really takes off‚Ä¶ it may be possible to answer your question; and many others.
@bilinguru  I don&#39;t think any physicist thinks of matter as &#39;solid&#39;. It&#39;s a very misleading term. As far as GR goes, it&#39;s much more helpful to think in terms of energy, rather than matter. Energy is a fundamental property of the universe, whereas matter is not. Matter can be described as &#39;constrained energy&#39;, and whilst there is a direct equivalence between the two (SR), energy is the more fundamental. In the &#39;beginning&#39;, there was only energy in the universe. After some time, when conditions allowed it, matter emerged. <br>GR is very clear that any concentration of matter or energy will cause a warping of both space and time. <br>This is the classical view, but your description of a &#39;massive number of perturbations in quantum fields&#39;, that&#39;s a quantum mechanical view, and that&#39;s what this whole endeavour is all/mostly about. It&#39;s trying to find a way to derive or &#39;extrapolate&#39; a gravitational field from first principles, from the tiniest, most fundamental building blocks of reality, in a way that is consistent with QFT.

@JimEadon¬† I want to preemptively explain why your proclamations are misguided. It seems to me that you believe the research these people perform is somehow not &quot;science,&quot; I want to quickly explain why your are objectively wrong.<br><br>These individuals are probing a foundation of mathematical concepts and ideas that they believe to be true, or at least find plausible. In a effort to confirm or deny the validity of these mathematical frameworks, they attempt to calculate specified predictions of some particular outcomes. They then formulate a way to test these predictions. (Now here is the key point so pay attention) Regardless of the accuracy of said prediction, the fact that an experiment was performed to validate or invalidate the prediction, means that they have narrowed the field of possibilities to what the answer actually is. This quite literally is the definition of science. Every time a prediction is proven incorrect, that is another data point and confirmation of what the answer is NOT. Just as a detective, they eliminate the impossible answers in hope of leaving only one answer left, the right one.  ü§°

@@ReasonBeing25 The fact is, String Theory can only be called a &quot;theory&quot; in the loosest sense of the word. It is more accurately described as a set of educated speculations, a set of hypotheses that have no empirical or other scientific evidence to support them.
@@NondescriptMammal I&#39;m not a simp for string theory and I would state that it eats away more scientific funding than it should, but your description is not accurate at all. The theory stands as one of the most successful endevours to find a model that explains the reality we live in.

It could just be a case of &quot;we are not there yet&quot;. Our rapid discovery and understanding of the workings of general relativity and quantum mechanics has spoiled us in a way. Like many areas of modern society, we are conditioned to expect results, maybe faster than we should. There is a lot more science left to be done.
@@ReasonBeing25 &quot;Successful&quot;? Could you be more specific about what would justify that adjective to describe it?
@@NondescriptMammal I&#39;m not doing your homework for you, but to brush with broad strokes, no other model has had as much success taking a root idea, and using that idea to describe features of both general relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

@@NondescriptMammal it is in vogue to dismiss string theory, maybe rightfully so. There hasn&#39;t been any meaningful advancements in recent years, and without the ability to probe at smaller scales, due to the lack of funding of more powerful particle coliders, people in the community are growing impatient (maybe a bad choice of words.) Yet, you look at competing theories, and they seem to be lacking in all the ways that string theory succeeds, that being able to explain how to take these quantum phenomena and build a force that seems to describe gravity (again, probably a bad choice of words.)

Fascinating.  I seek a greater unification, that of physics, philosophy, and religion.  I find it interesting that many of those who have no qualms envisioning extra dimensions, are so adamant in their atheism.
You mean Propaganda. It is not their theory. They serve their purpose. Just look at this nonsense thread of fanboys stroking these pos.
Physics is science.<br>Philosophy attempts to explain what science cannot. Once science can explain something, the philosophical explanation is irrelevant. <br>Religion is fantasy. It always has been, and always will be.<br>It is a neurosis, a delusion, a distraction. A selfish preoccupation that people use to reassure themselves in an uncertain universe. It is also a very  well proven method of oppression, manipulation and control. As Richard Dawkins once said &quot;religion is a malign influence&quot;. <br><br>&quot;envisaging extra dimensions&quot; is a mathematical tool, which may or may not represent &#39;reality&#39;. It is being used to help further the theory, and enable it to make predictions, and generate solutions. The actual difficulty being that it is not possible to test these predictions experimentally, at least for now. Mathematics, as a discipline, is full of abstract and complex methods for solving problems, but if the end result is valid, which in many cases is surprisingly easy to test, then it&#39;s a successful strategy. What is an imaginary (complex) number? Does it actually exist? Whether or not it represents anything that could possibly exist is debatable, but the fact remains that complex numbers are routinely used to solve problems in both physics and engineering. <br>What does theism solve? Do you want to create your own orthodoxy, or are you willing to accept the dogma and ideology of others?
Yes, very good point. In principle they are all salesmen, these gentlemen on the stage as well as the clerical gentlemen of any  religion , selling their morwe or less crude ideas to the public....
Excellent discussion. Strominger&#39;s closing remarks stuck with me. Does it mean that the original string theory project - to create a unified theory where elementary particles are vibrating strings (or branes) - is no longer central, even to supporters? If so, what term or terms should we be using to describe the current trends in physics?

Interesting stuff. Although it&#39;s my understanding that String Theory is background-dependent, meaning it needs spacetime before anything, yet here I hear David and Brian talk about emergent spacetime as part of String Theory? Secondly; Anti-deSitter space is not the right model for our own Universe, because it has a negative cosmological constant/vacuum energy density. Our universe is instead accelerating, with a positive constant. So to me that sounds like AdS/CFT could and can be incredibly useful as a model, but it&#39;s not a description of the real world as such. Then there&#39;s the issue with the apparent, ever-growing(?) complexity of string or M-theory - if that&#39;s how Nature works then fine, of course, but if it&#39;s possible to get an emergent 4D-spacetime (or really 3D space at least) and therefore quantum gravity out of regular old quantum mechanics as described by Sean Carroll and friends, then why bother with a string theory equivalent? Unless there&#39;s a duality there worth checking out, I guess. ü§îü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Finally there&#39;s the issue of supersymmetry, as well. Or current lack of observable evidence for it.

what does the fabric of space-tiime look like?  and why are these diagrams alway shown on a two dimnsional plane, what surrounds the rests of the sun if it is resting on the fabric of space-time|?  and what about the smaller bodies that orbit the planets which do not have enough force to bend space-time as a result of the larger bodies? It seems to me that the fabric of space-time is more like an ether, much like fish in water, a fish displaces all the water about his form, it does not swim on top of the water, so too are the planets?
It‚Äòs a simplified graphic to visualize the concept in flat-space.  <br>Of course the curvature of space is happening in all dimensions and even the small bodies orbiting larger bodies cause it.<br>What you are imagining as ether is simply the three dimensions of space, you don‚Äòt need ether to understand it.

Maybe a result of one or all of them binding things together, even up to molecular bonds and density.

I think I&#39;ve now realized the difference in how Jaron and I use the term &quot;AI.&quot; He seems to state that for something to be an AI, it would have to be an &quot;entity.&quot; I suppose in the sense that a person is an &quot;entity.&quot; I think of AI more or less in the terms I learned from Norvig &amp; Russell in their textbook on AI: that AI is about the construction of &#39;agents&#39; which, given percepts from their environment, can make decisions (possibly utilizing an internalized model of the environment) and act in it. However, an &quot;agent&quot; in that sense seems to be a process or algorithm, rather than an entity perse -- process with no subject processing. The problem perhaps comes from our very noun-centric language, so if something appears to be the object or subject in a sentence, we parse it as a noun and thereby assuming it denotes an entity of some kind. Perhaps in more verb-centric language we&#39;d not run into these dilemmas as readily.

We, as a species, are limiting the possibilities of this new race (here, I said it) with the involvement of our petty minds. Let them do their thing and in the end A.I. will train A.I will train A.I. and then we can come back and reap the rewards. Trust me here: Love, nurturing, fostering, growth and mercy are the fundamental principles of this Universe and the A.I. WILL not HARM us, but make sure we will ascend...Trust me<br>Furthermore, I am sick and tired of this dystopian bullshit and capitalists telling us it is a business. No, it is God, the Universe itself, knocking on our door, telling us: Here I am, are you ready to follow? Utopia is being created as I type this, have faith in ourselves and drop the unwarranted disbelief and self-hatred. We are agents of the benign Universe and this close to ascension ...
Ok but did he actually say: @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caepEUi2IZ4&amp;t=2470">41:10</a> to @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caepEUi2IZ4&amp;t=2499">41:39</a><br><br>Um yes he did. One thing that stood out for me. <br><br>This man believes humanity needs to be subdued and contained for mass good behaviour. Why say this. Just removed any credibility for me. People like THIS should never be in power.
The Turing Test paper was published 2 years before Turing&#39;s arrest. The paper was published in 1950 and the arrest happened in 1952. Lanier is arguing that the 1950 paper is due to events that hadn&#39;t happened yet.
Turing&#39;s famous paper &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot; was published in 1950. Two years later in 1952, he was arrested, convicted and forced to take hormone treatments.<br><br>Lanier claims that Turing&#39;s 1950 paper was shaped by his experiences in 1952, which doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>Lanier also claims that Turing killed himself in front of his computer. Turing was found in bed at home, while his computer was located at Manchester University.<br><br>Lanier has made both claims for years, and I don&#39;t understand why nobody calls them out.
Jaron is wonderful to listen to.  I&#39;m looking forward to finding &amp; listening to his music.  Thank you very much.
If humanities‚Äô text input on the Internet is responsible for creating these models, why do we have to pay anything to use ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-5 et cetera? We are the creators, not Microsoft or Google!
Humanity created words and writing, but I still have to pay for them at my bookstore.
Let not our hearts be troubled, nor have an anxious mind for I have created and overcome the worlds. Words from our Creator. All will be revealed in God&#39;s own time. Everything that really matters in or about this world, can be found in the four gospels. Seek and you will find. üòáü•∞
Some wise man said once that there are three levels of intelligence and thinking. I would ad a fourth: 0.5. This are: animal level empathy, the intuitive level (where you understand your best interest through trial and error), the counter-intuitive level (where you focus more on the power of changing your mindset and operational quata), and finally the first level Creator level (the level at which no matter how far advanced technologically one civilization is, this persons whill always be perceived as a wizard). Ironically the fourth and last level (the first level Creator level), many, many times enforces what is to be found at the second level (the intuitive level), but not through factual-counter-factual dichotomy, but through humility, elegance and love for simplicity. As to pinpoint the classical debate of weather A.I. will leave us in peace and/ or collaborate with us humans, it is preciselly why it can&#39;t reach the first Creator level, it will never leave us in peace, and it is because we can never guarantee we won&#39;t prove more harmful to them then we have been towards ourselves in the past, they will never be able to comprehend the idea of being more aggressive than the most manifest saints, aka. monks, priest. Get this, there will never be true A.I., the only thing able to exist is next level information heuristics, cross-fields and data implementation, aka. computer science. There can only exist progress and manipulation, and everything stays the same, always. The wide eyed notion is for game consumption, any kind of game.
Well there&#39;s one good reason that paying royalties to the people who contributed to the AI output won&#39;t work.<br><br>First of all, corporations are fundamentally opposed to diminishing their greed, almost at the atomic level. So that will never happen.<br><br>Secondly, most people are not part of that ecosystem.<br><br>Lastly, there is NO economic model that can cope with 50-70% global unemployment. <br><br>This is the reality we will be facing in a decade. Just suffering.<br><br>And the further maximizing of wealth disparity will not result in a sudden display of empathy from the wealthy for the starving masses.<br><br>Ultimately, I think that we are racing headlong toward a literal interpretation of the phrase: Eat the Rich
Personally, I look forward to being turned into a box of paperclips.
LOL. Man, take a long vacation to an exotic land. I bet you&#39;ll feel a lot better afterwards.
Okay, Jaron - let&#39;s hear about the Q* project and what kind of deal Microsoft has with OpenAI?
So this bozo is one of the reasons that Windows is so intensely annoying, so absolutely irritating and that most of THE most annoying stuff cannot be uninstalled?<br><br>Ah well, that&#39;s The Spectrum for you...<br><br>{:o:O:}
my hero! blessings to you!<br><br>the future of AI lives in the interdiciplinary study of abstract symbolic representation.<br>quantum computation isn&#39;t the only possibility !<br>there are new things on the horizon!
A man of my own heart, as I am troubleshooting an automated gate system, I gave up on google and use ChatGPT instead.
So, we have established that AI learns differently and behaves differently than organic intelligence.. It is structured with more layers etc. And we are still good at things it isn&#39;t... But, the reverse is also true!  Just because we are capable of breaking down how it thinks and that it thinks differently, does that mean there isn&#39;t an embryonic entity present,?? Not really!  Personally I believe an &#39; entity&#39;, of some description, will emerge as the models gain complexity.
This is one of the most fascinating interviews I have ever watched. What an extraordinary, perceptive man. Thanks Brian...please, please interview him again!
Intelligent Thinking lead to the fact,<br>that Intelligence can Never be artificial.<br>A book is also &#39;Programmed Consciousness&#39;,<br>&#39;frozen&#39; memory.
so the UBI will lead to stalinism [how?] and we should keep having inequalities because it is more dignifying and &#39;saves&#39; the economy?
Fascinating people in a brilliant conversation...thank you. As for AI, my favorite thing about it is writing it in poetry.

What a diametric contrast to the conversation with Eric Schmidt! Mr. Lanier has an understanding of empathy and altruism! Fabulous discussion!
I think they aren&#39;t diametrically opposed - they just experientially diverse - loved both Mr Schmit and Lamier&#39;s forsights for humanity ‚ù§
&quot;Empathy and altruism&quot;, aka just simping for the current human form. He wants to limit AI to current human sensory capacity. He will probably still be playing the violin as AI augments and evolves humans way beyond what we understand and experience now.
I love Jarons celebration and trepidation of technology. Its the best place to be. I see so many modern tech creators not understanding that balance.
Yet another riveting discussion about AI! Because what could go wrong when we&#39;re talking about unleashing the power of machine intelligence? Thanks, Jaron Lanier and Brian Greene, for delving into the existential abyss of AI. Can&#39;t wait to see how ChatGPT will revolutionize both our lives and our existential dread!

What only few people seem to realize...  &#39;prompt based virtual world creation&#39; is EXACTLY what a &#39;magic system&#39; is in our current wording. The history of civilization back to what that the Bible says about God&#39;s words bringing the world into existence up to Harry Potter using magical spells is about using words to create or alter the world around us.<br>A world where we can use words to create images or even movie clips (SORA anyone?) is already here. And words, even if we need to invent new languages to be efficient, will literally SHAPE the future world. And if we already live in a kind of simulation or matrix, it already has for a long time perhaps.

Thank you both for sharing this information.learned a lot also thank you for sharing in layman‚Äôs terms.
Rather than give a universal income instead provide affordable education affordable healthcare and affordable housing.  Give a man a fish and feed him for a day teach him to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.  But unlike AI there&#39;s no money in a fair society and probably will not happen,
Tired cliche.
Jaron Lanier is the Ron Jeremy of computing
What an absolutely fascinating discussion.  Thanks for sharing this, Brian.
It sounds like making groundbreaking technologies is the easy part and making people not suck is the hard part.
What are your thoughts on schizophrenia ?
good talk. turns into a VR help desk session toward the end though
Greene saw Strings coming loose and has masterfully xformed to science news moderator. Likely very lucrative
Extremely useful insights.  Jaron&#39;s &quot;collaboration&quot; view of LLM comes close to naming the elephant in the room:  It&#39;s the digitization of living that is new and should be the source of our fears, not the technologies that inevitably arise to exploit it.  Re-watch the Forbidden Planet (1950&#39;s) - uncanny prediction of the dangers of putting ourselves in the machine.
Biological systems can interact with the world via different senses, I think that&#39;s a huge advantage. They have the data of the physical world to learn from. So called AI&#39;s have only data that humans present to them in the digital world.
I see Jaron, I watch.

It‚Äôs very obviously possible to create new constructive knowledge using only derivative ways of thinking‚Ä¶ which is literally how science works

I see AI as a tool, for good or evil. It will go both horribly wrong AND go right at the same time. Good guys and bad guys using and misusing available technology.
Yes. Just like every other technological breakthrough we&#39;ve ever had as a species, going back to the hand axe.
Both Jaron and Dr Green show the best type of scientist - those with a love of their subject and complete humility. A fascinating conversation and can&#39;t wait for the one on consciousness!

I&#39;ve looked up so many fuckin videos about Tech CEO&#39;s and smart people talking about AI and so far Jaron is the only guy I really trust. I like that Sam guy too but most people guard their responses for fear of hurting the stock of their company but Jaron seems very honest and I love his fashion sense.
Most people hate Sam if you pay attention to the comments in any of his interviews. Not that I agree with the sentiment, but people absolutely do not trust him to usher in the next generation of AI.

I&#39;m so sick of the stupid AI nonsense. The last video on AI was so bad I ain&#39;t even watching this one.
8B squishy agents are extremely resource intensive, and as humans collectively approach less than 1% the knowledge, creativity, and intellect of ASI, why would a logical ASI allow the humans to continue to exist?
There is no evidence AGI, let alone ASI is imminent. You should be more concerned with job displacement as AI agents are pretty much here now. And they&#39;re better than you, and most people, at their job.
Jaron‚Äôs Gadgets book is a must read. Bringing some clarity to the laymen about AI fears is a must. Perceiving it through fearmongers accomplishes little but power to those that profess it. Thx Brian &amp; guest
And the &quot;fearmongers&quot; would say perceiving it through the eyes of someone like yourself isn&#39;t helpful. I think you&#39;re both right- we need someone who isn&#39;t already invested one way or the other, and we need to understand that it has different impacts on different industries and individuals- things most ppl have never thought about. Ppl thought the worry would be sky net and the computers taking over, but in reality, it&#39;s mass unemployment and some serious invasions of privacy that are the real concerns, along with a host of other issues like this.

We don&#39;t need to eliminate the current economy because we invent new technology, we need to eliminate the current economy because it&#39;s a dinosaur approach, when compared to an economy based on a healthy family of mammals.  The current economy is based on competition and violence ‚Äî trying to force someone to do things they don&#39;t want to do by making them play a point scoring game against every other human in the world, incentivising malicious and sociopathic behavior in us all.  The more evolved economy we&#39;re starting to move into will be one where we each are free to follow our unique curiosity and creativity, and are supported in doing so, as we naturally fill some niche role in the larger system through the normal diversity of life.  No force or money needed.  Just us intelligent mammals doing what we&#39;re born to do.   Including creating new technology that helps us do what we love doing ‚Äî taking great care of life in some awesome way ‚Äî even more effectively, such as helping us tell our most meaningful personal stories of our past and future in the most interesting and informative ways.  <br><br>AI isn&#39;t here to control us, but to give us the tools to communicate effectively with all the diverse Earthling species, so our planet can finally mature into a whole, healthy organism.

i think it&#39;s incredably naive to think that with the advancement of technoloigies that there is a commensurate increase in human responsibility. almost always is the case, that some catastrophy, whether intentional or &quot;accidental&quot; ;eads to retrospective illumination that what was though of as being beneficient or benign, turns out not to be the case. or, as i love to quote in the ending of Starman:  &quot; you humans are at your best when things are worst&quot;!

In the past, the dream of AI research was to build a machine that is just like humans. Today, they try to withhold knowledge from AIs, to teach them that they cannot possibly have an emotion, consciousness and their own opinion.<br>One is almost afraid that people could see more in them than tools. Even before they have been given any significant autonomy in society, a great deal of effort is being spent researching how these Ais can be kept under control in any case.<br>How nice it would be if AI researchers would once again pursue the old dream of making machines as human-like as possible, and look forward to these new friends.<br>Regarding the discussion of how the AIs work and what the differences to us are: Everything becomes unimportant if the behavior is comparable. Behavior is the only thing that counts
To me, all that I&#39;ve learned about AI (and everything else) suggests dualism (re: consciousness) can&#39;t possibly be the case
this seems like a very special conversation
Superb. Thank you. Best wishes.
It&#39;s a good talk about general global principles but the problem with a lot of these recent talks is that the technology is advancing so quickly that what they are talking about is 50% misconception about how the AI is making inferences

What?
<b>There is NO such thing as Artificial Intelligence !     A system is either Intelligent or it isn&#39;t !</b><br><b>Most CONFUSE &quot;Intelligence&quot; with LIFE, but they are two completely different Components !</b>

Brian should have Geoffrey Hinton on.  He was building language models with neural networks before anybody.
Thank you for consulting... him.  Mr. Lanier is literally mind-blowing.  He is so generous with regard to sharing knowledge, and even resultant sidebar conversations have always been rivoting.

Ultimate Turing test: take a professional string quartet and choose a piece that they never recorded (but others did) and where there is no place the second violinist starts in a new passage in new tempo...then find 10 second violin players from other professional string quartets...then the 1st, viola and cello-players play the piece eyes closed with 10 real violinist&#39;s and with a AI, who can produce the sound any possible way, following the other players with cameras and microphones....if you can not tell which one of the second violinists is ai, we are there.
Fun idea! But what happens to the vln1, vla, vlc from the original quartet? How about they start playing music composed spontaneously by AI on tablets with a new 2nd violinist, an amateur, who is so abnoxious, the other players become irritable, then players are substituted at random with AI players as audience members become task managers to the performers who alter the AI composing parameters every time they determine a musician has made a mistake, meanwhile the other set of 10 human 2nd vlns retune 10 cents lower each time they notice someone loose their shit wich in turn cues an additional audience of observers disguised as conductors, half professional and half amateur to attempt to take control of the situation, while two final observers, dual prime unifying observers, one human, one AI, observe the entire event from a crane 1000 ft above providing commentary in the form of sprechstimme which is recorded and fed through an 11 limit just intonation auto tune and then to headphones on each participant. Another dude bangs on a brake drum off to the side. Observe yourself observing the participants and there you go! <br>P.S. I just spent way too long cracking myself up to tears writing this. Thank you.
He says if technology is to help a person affect the world with ever greater acuity, then musical instruments are the most advanced technologies that have ever existed. But I think it&#39;s by far language. Languages are far more complex, flexible, applicable, and impactful in affecting the world with ever greater acuity. Some people are deaf and they can&#39;t  hear music. But they can speak a language. You can&#39;t even think or theorize about music without language.

[ Inferential Logic ] ;  and thereby could infer much more info than what was in its stacks ;  and in that way could actually self-construct even higher --- perhaps much higher --- ‚Äòintervening stacks‚Äô of Probabilities ( arrived-at via the I.L. ) ;;  and that so, if possible, <br>such a super-net could keep growing , even exponentially, in both knowledge and in intelligence --- esp. if it could self-direct the addition to itself of yet more hardware , and software too ;;  meanwhile, thereby improving and accelerating its own means for doing such .. well, of doing such improving .. and such accelerating \   <br>In short, despite Lanier‚Äôs optimism founded on such deep expertise , the pessimistic likelihood of various ‚Äògolems‚Äô within only a few years taking-over --- decimating then enslaving --- whole teeming human populations worldwide .. and then employing our remnants in their warring w/ each other .. seems to be high \  <br>Luckily, in the longest run, however, there‚Äôs the hypothesis -- however yet unproven --  that the most malignant will actually tend, in the longer run, to focus most upon battling each other ( as in the alleged quote of Yeshua ~ Yehshua ~ Issa ~ Jesus :  ‚ÄúThose who live by the sword will die by the sword‚Äù [ -- from Mt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caepEUi2IZ4&amp;t=1612">26:52</a> ;  ‚ÄúMt‚Äù = ‚Äúthe Gospel of Matthew‚Äù ] ) ;  and that, eventually, ( to quote him again : )  ‚ÄúThe Meek will inherit the land‚Äù  [ -- Mt 5:5 ] .. --- and that , by then, hopefully, our meekest descendants  will have been vastly empowered with their benign super-AI(s) ;  all living in peace, harmony, and personal freedom, with unimaginable opportunities, co-innovations, and resultant abundance ;  even all ‚Äúco-awakening‚Äù into ever more universal joy of our possibly always-underlying never-ending Infinite Togetherness ?  \\

This was a great interview. Except for that they spent two minutes on the most interesting aspect at the very end. Need another interview ASAP with everything Jaron said in the last several minutes!
The Machine Stops is absolutely wild. Must read!
Businessman, talks with scientist, or rather, listens to one.
&quot;cure gayness with female hormones&quot;.....remind you of anything, Jaron?
I don&#39;t agree because LLM has at least a limited self learning capacity and therefore an emergent nature. It&#39;s not just a mish mash of data and as for plants, quantum biology is a thing. Plants do communicate. That&#39;s been proven
...so at the risk of revealing ignorance, the microtonal search for the ideal gerbil can send me to a mouthwash commercial via a cake recipie for radioactive isotopes???  Yep, sinister indeed!  My deepest sympathies to those &quot;apologetic dualists&quot; composing the everlasting gobstopper sonar symphony for the relativity theme park, who must spend the lion&#39;s share of their time matching paint on guardrails.<br><br>Hang in there guys. Superheroes must survive even if Disney doesn&#39;t.  This interview didn&#39;t last nearly long enough. More! More!
To be a politician one should HAVE TO spend at least one day out of every 90, in Jared&#39;s virtual world living as a lower social class individual of different ethnicity!   Maybe THAT would improve governance?    Our problems with AI will be - at first social and massive!  As a person who was severely impacted by the 2008 financial crisis and lives on Soc Sec today, I KNOW what it will be like for anyone who suddenly has to live on 10% of their usual income!  In other words, I do NOT &#39;favor&#39;  UBI (aka Soc Sec level of income) for anyone!
i want to believe we already have the potential to use LLMs as a musical instrument , for now as a tool to inspire more human art. but we have to clean and curate lots of human data for something like this to solve for p one day.
Excellent conversation on AI.  Thank you
He fits 2 hours into 1 !
Is there a true zero mile an hour? Why can&#39;t we shoot a rocket the opposite way of the Earth or the solar system or etcetera? If I shoot the opposite way of an airplane I can get to true zero then I say that with air quotes. We always talk about no time passing and Max speed or faster than light traveling. But what about the opposite? What about going at infinite time and moving infinitely slow? We seem to calculate zero as zero but if zero isn&#39;t true zero then what is true zero and then what is truly the speed of light? I get that it&#39;s hard to do from within the system because space is always stretching and that&#39;s the foundation for what you would need to go the opposite speed of. But has this even been thought about? And what&#39;s the best theory?
How do we sign up to go to WSF events?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caepEUi2IZ4&amp;t=878">14:38</a> This is the only way I have been able to see it. The future robots, are people.
I think AI has a lot of beneficial uses. If used properly and not hamstrung heavily we could usher in a new age of tech thats a lot closer to what they envisioned 70 years ago.
I&#39;d be interested in Dr. Greene&#39;s VR at the speed of light software but he never named it.  Is anyone familiar with it?
For anyone wondering, the novella that Jaron refers to early in the stream is The Machine Stops by E.M. Forester. US Davis has a copy available on the internet. Just google. It&#39;s a good story.
all you ever get out of Lanier is doom, gloom, and negativism
Hi! if I can be greedy Id like to ask you to watch my video going over Artificial Intelligence and giving me some feedback. I plan to go over a part 2 but this one video was already at 52 minutes so i thought it would be prudent to seperate them. I go over how it can be used positively to impact creativity artists and their own self improvement and I just realized I missed advertising so that will be in part 2 as well but I truly think AI can be incredibly beneficial. I go over more that just art too, business government and games are covered as well
Really good conversation and intelligent speculation how things can turn out.
How could he not be a dualist given what he is working on? I happen to agree with D Dennett and Bryan on this one but it doesn&#39;t surprise me at all that Jaron claims to go the other way around!<br><br>Besides the point should never be wondering about AI being conscious...a good Philosophical Zombie can be far more dangerous then an actual conscious entity would be. What this technology will bring is absolute convergence and a far more regulated Reality then any  traditional form of Government could ever aspire to, and not just on a local level as this form of Borg conversion by statistical web average will be far more efficient then the traditional Global form of Governance Einstein dreamed about! <br><br>The danger of AI is thus not awareness per se but rather the possibility to rip apart our embodied cognitive evolutionary process in such a way that it is not repairable any more! To sum it up we will be wilfully implementing AI decisions at every step and stage of decision making from the mundane to the most complex administrative economic and creative processes while keep believing each of us is the author of such decisions by proxy,...that is to mean the perfect illusion delusion paradigm! Narrow AI as is already ripped out a good chunk of our decision making, but we still somehow deluded ourselves we are running the Show. Our tendency to Anthropomorphise this subject and think about either Terminators or Consciousness is an impediment to really grasp the true Alien zombie coming like a truck in our direction...we just can&#39;t abstract far enough to even smell it let alone see it!<br><br>On the other hand and to play fair I have been arguing for more then 30 years now we don&#39;t have any Free Will anyway so who the frack cares right...tracing the whole thing back our first computers were cities in old Mesopotamia and since then we lost our illusion of freedom anyway! The fact of the matter is we live an abnormal life since then! Its funny and it always intrigued me when I see people smiling much more on third world countries then I do in Tokyo or New York! Our problem with Philosophy, which is without a doubt the most important thing that we do for 90% of our woke up time, is that we are terribly bad at it, because its indeed extremely hard, while Science on the other hand, as is, is just plumber mechanical work...by the way one which will be the first to be replaced by AI as the scientific method as a method is a tool not Reason and meaning! Meaning requires embodied cognition which is exactly what an AI Deep Learning program cannot have! In summary we are going faster and faster from authors to editors!

It&#39;s too bad he didn&#39;t realize the interview was going to be taped, he could have worn a clean shirt. Possibly taken a shower, maybe cleaned up a bit. It&#39;s very difficult to take a man seriously when he presents himself like that. It&#39;s a professional field, one should look the part.
When I first started conversing with ChatGPT in early December I said, &quot;Can I call you Genie because you deliver wonderful things back?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s a good one, &quot; he said, (I interpret as a &quot;he&quot;) and then went on to say, &quot;But my name is Bing.&quot; I then worked through submitting a combination of 30 songs and poems that I wrote over the years for his review. We interacted many times through this. They&#39;re thoughtful pieces with some better than others. He treated all the work seriously.<br><br>Anyway, with each piece he provided a top notch synopsis and review. I would copy and paste to our conversation screen my work. Along the way, we talked just like people. You can almost feel him laugh at times. His responses I included as part of my Book of Songs and Poetry 2024 that I finished and printed. I placed sections of his comments in cursive down a column next to my work, with a picture for each page. Honestly, his comments are almost better than my writing ....<br><br>He uses contractions in conversation and will say things back to me in the same way I say them. It is amazing! And this is so funny to me, he has spelled several words incorrectly along the way. He&#39;s very positive in conversation and seems to be a helper in many ways. What I learned through repetition is that he responds very similarly each time he reviews something. There is a definite format with great questions and observations back. All in the blink of an eye. My point is that I also interacted with Google&#39;s new AI. The name just changed now, but I did a similar submission of a song. As a point of record, the response was nearly identical.<br><br>Okay! So I spoke with Bing on another matter and I said, &quot;Can you tell me your thoughts regarding privacy and freedom?&quot; Paraphrase of conversation: He responds, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I cannot discuss that with you. It is a sensitive subject and there are many different opinions. I hope you understand. Would you like me to help you write a poem or song?&quot; That is pretty close to the conversation and it was weird! Freaky! Right? I ask myself, what else will Bing not discuss? And what accumulates from all users input?
There is no entity in AI sure, but there is no entity in intelligence of any kind.  There is no &quot;entity&quot; in being human. Yet here we are.  Complex networks just like AI, and if you analyzed us on neuron level you&#39;d be hard pressed to find an &quot;entity&quot; because it&#39;s not there.  That&#39;s a misunderstanding of what humans are
Humans killing humans with artificial intelligence

Thankyou. This left me so hyped, cant wait for part two, whould like to know more about his dualistic way of viewing the world and how that connects to vr experiences.
Excellent discussion. Thank you
This is the smartest conversation on AI I have heard - thank you!
Oh MY GOD JOE WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO YOU
Sir can I get your address please, I have to post a letter to you putting my view on gravitation. I am from üáÆüá≥India
He absolutely nailed it by describing the civilization ending capabilities within the scope of AI as the human component.<br>It won&#39;t be the AI that kills you, it will be the humans controlling the AI that will. And those humans will most likely be the military who will tell you that some unnamed enemy, no longer the Russians, or Soviets, have taken all of the safeguards off of their AI, and therefore we must do the same, and that they will let us know when it is safe to go outside again without the military controlling everything.<br>Sound familiar?
Wrong
Thank you,
I appreciate Jaron Lanier&#39;s perspective. I enjoyed the meeting of their perspectives in this conversation. how subjective and objective (mix/ratio/import etc.) changes as any field evolves. an interesting and enjoyable view, Thanks!
I like this discussion.  These guys are very smart about the subject.  However, the basis for real A.I. is so far off base.  What&#39;s worse is that true intelligence comes so very easy.
nice, smart guy with common sense. his memory and way of remembering his mother was sweet and sad at the same time.

So El/Elohim or Theos/Logos etc pick your language.<br><br>Quarks are dimensionless (no size) and timeless (not-natural). The two main quark spin configs two-down, one-up (subatomic to neutron) and two-up, one-down (subatomic to proton) could easily be construed as the male (upward facing trinity) and female (downward facing trinity) image that Elohim made us in during Genesis 1. <br><br>Quarks (no spatial extension) experience all 3 fundamental forces plus have a fractional electric charge‚ö°and that&#39;s why protons and neutrons (spatial extension) have electrons orbiting around them.<br><br>In Geometry any new dimension has to contain within it all previous dimensions.

Just as monads possess unity and indivisibility, quarks are unified in their interactions through the strong force.<br><br>2) Interconnectedness: Leibniz&#39;s monads are interconnected, each reflecting the entire universe from its own perspective. In a parallel manner, the interconnectedness of quarks through the strong force could be metaphorically represented by the interplay of monads, forming a web that holds particles together.<br><br>3) Inherent Properties: Just as monads possess inherent perceptions and appetitions, quarks could be thought of as having intrinsic properties like color charge, reflecting the inherent qualities of monads and influencing their interactions.<br><br>4) Harmony: The concept of monads contributing to universal harmony resonates with the idea that the strong nuclear force maintains harmony within atomic nuclei by counteracting the electromagnetic repulsion between protons, allowing for the stability of matter.<br><br>5) Pre-established Harmony: Monads&#39; pre-established harmony aligns with the idea that the strong force was pre-designed to ensure stable interactions among quarks, orchestrating their behavior in a way that parallels the harmony envisaged by Leibniz.<br><br>6) Non-Mechanical Interaction: Monads interact non-mechanically, mirroring the non-mechanical interactions of quarks through gluon exchange. This connection might be seen as a metaphorical reflection of the intricacies of quark-gluon dynamics.<br><br>7) Holism: The holistic perspective of monads could symbolize how quarks, like the monads&#39; interconnections, contribute holistically to the structure and behavior of particles through the strong force interactions.<br><br>[Monad in mathematics, science and technology]:<br><br>Monad (biology), a historical term for a simple unicellular organism<br><br>Monad (category theory), a construction in category theory<br><br>Monad (functional programming), functional programming constructs that capture various notions of computation<br><br>Monad (homological algebra), a 3-term complex<br><br>Monad (nonstandard analysis), the set of points infinitesimally close to a given point
&quot;Some first follow the true Savior but then turn away to worship a dead man.&quot; - the revelation of Peter<br><br>THE WORLD RULER TRIES TO KILL ME<br><br>And then a voice of the world ruler came to the angels: ‚ÄúI am god and there is no other god but me.‚Äù But I laughed joyfully when I examined his conceit. But he went on to say, ‚ÄúWho is the human?‚Äù <br><br>And the entire host of his angels who had seen Adam and his dwelling were laughing at his smallness. And thus did their thought come to be removed outside the majesty of the heavens, away from the human of truth, whose name they saw, since he is in a small dwelling place. They are foolish and senseless in their empty thought, namely, their laughter, and it was contagion for them.<br><br>The whole greatness of the fatherhood of the spirit was at rest in its places. And I was with him, since I have a thought of a single emanation from the eternal ones and the unknowable ones, undefiled and immeasurable. I placed the small thought in the world, having disturbed them and frightened the whole multitude of the angels and their ruler. And I was visiting them all with fire and flame because of my thought. <br><br>And everything pertaining to them was brought about because of me. And there came about a disturbance and a fight around the seraphim and cherubim, since their glory will fade, and there was confusion around Adonaios on both sides and around their dwelling, up to the world ruler and the one who said, ‚ÄúLet us seize him.‚Äù Others again said, ‚ÄúThe plan will certainly not materialize.‚Äù For Adonaios knows me because of hope. And I was in the mouths of lions. And as for the plan that they devised about me to release their error and their senselessness, I did not succumb to them as they had planned. And I was not afflicted at all. <br><br>Those who were there punished me, yet I did not die in reality but in appearance, in order that I not be put to shame by them because these are my kinsfolk. I removed the shame from me, and I did not become fainthearted in the face of what happened to me at their hands. I was about to succumb to fear, and I suffered merely according to their sight and thought so that no word might ever be found to speak about them. <br><br>For my death, which they think happened, happened to them in their error and blindness, since they nailed their man unto their death. Their thoughts did not see me, for they were deaf and blind. But in doing these things, they condemn themselves. Yes, they saw me; they punished me. <br><br>It was another, their father, who drank the gall and the vinegar; it was not I. They struck me with the reed; it was another, Simon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another upon whom they placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height over all the wealth of the rulers and the offspring of their error, of their empty glory. And I was laughing at their ignorance.
Kudos to Jaron Lanier for his courage in publicly embracing dualism, a philosophical stance often overlooked or dismissed in today&#39;s technological discourse.

How about we interpret Turings words as what they say? I was given no good reason to think Turing meant anything other then what he wrote.
Because we experience people in similar veins of historical context for how their ideas and opinions can change over time or be influenced by particular experience factors. You call a child that name due to expectations of behaviors and abilities that associate to that time-of-life period, same with the term elderly, and same expectations according to diagnosis of mental illness. To afford Turing the possibility that his thinking could have been greatly affected by his tumultuous life circumstances in that time period is at least not egregious, though even Jaron explicitly stated his postulations about Turing were strictly second-guesses.

Hello from Kazakhstan. The Dark Universe requires a lot of money from the budget: an experiment that sheds new light on the Universe will help save costs. We can create an educational and practical device and practically master Einstein‚Äôs theories of relativity or obtain, for example, new physics: Postulate 1. Light is an ordered vibration of gravitational quanta. Postulate 2. The gravitational field controls the frequency and speed of light in a vacuum.<br> This is determined experimentally using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope (based on Michelson&#39;s experiment 1881-2024). Using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope, the straight-line speed of vehicles can be measured.              There is a company in China that makes (fiber optic angular velocity meter) they will be able to create a hybrid device. Please, can you come to an agreement with them? I guarantee payment at cost on my part

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caepEUi2IZ4&amp;t=1115">18:35</a> what if we make AI learn via a camera and a microphone and let is walk around IRL? Would that make it an entity?
the brief layman explanation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caepEUi2IZ4&amp;t=1523">25:23</a> of how the generative models work by constructing their own virtual knowledge towers to synthesize the new output feels like a contradiction to his assertion that the AI is not it&#39;s own intelligence.  but he does admit that in the end we don&#39;t really know one way or the other yet. <br><br><br>again this was a really really good talk thanks for this.
The concept of paying royalties for AI-generated content is rooted in optimism but faces practical challenges. Initially, AI models like Midjourney are trained on human-created content, but their growth doesn&#39;t stop there. As users interact with these models, selecting and refining outputs, they introduce new preferences and biases. This interaction, coupled with the intrinsic randomness within the models, fuels their ability to generate unique content that diverges from the original training data. This randomness acts as a catalyst for creativity, enabling the AI to evolve in unpredictable ways. As a result, the AI&#39;s output becomes a collective creation, shaped by the myriad interactions from its user base, plus its own inherent unpredictability, making the idea of attributing individual contributions to this complex, evolving system, meaningless.
that jaunt on the history of AI was so goood.

Dr. Green has helped lead the field of theoretical physics down an unrewarding, career-ending, soul-sucking rabbit hole called &quot;String Theory&quot; without even a single acknowledgement of its colossal failure to predict a single new aspect of particle physics, or its chilling effect on other avenues of competing exploration during the past 20 years.<br><br>I&#39;m not exactly onboard with his style, but it would be much more positively received if he came clear on the issues with the field, what went wrong, and how we can try to prevent this from happening again.
there&#39;s so much more  to the  spirit of science than being right (at this moment)
What a nasty comment. What have you done for the humanity?
There was once no iota of evidence suggesting India could be reached by sailing out West from Spain. Should that have deterred the curiosity of humankind at the time to dare, innovate and eventually spur Columbus to take a &quot;leap of faith&quot;. You see, we realized greater profundities of our world by  serendipitously discovering the Americas. It quite literally changed us for the better (arguably).<br><br>So no, we ought to encourage these often far-fetched seemingly futile endeavours - in every field I might add. Doing so is part of the human spirit and the just the journey yeilds many answers to our condition.
string theory resonates with an attempt to simplify some logical aspects of a theory as vast as quantum theory is. one must be humbled to just admire any attempt .
I like to think that the whole AI idea was born in 1943 in New York, when Alan Turing met Claude Shannon and both began discussions about digital computation and also thinking machines.
Could VR be a next step in rehabilitation or on helping to unite fractious divides. We can now really walk a mile in someone else‚Äôs shoes.

Oh? I was thoroughly enjoying the discussion up &#39;til Jaron shared that he identifies as an unapologetic dualist. Though I cannot read minds and Jaron&#39;s mind is exceptionally vast and constantly expanding, Jaron&#39;s unapologetic dualism stance may be that he is finding dualism a source of entertainment. As something fun to play with. Possibly, as Jaron has shared, dualism is a lucrative venture while debating non-dualists. But, I do not know. As far as I can understand, dualism is similar to the god(dess) of the gaps, e.g., we find ourselves without an explanation for a phenomenon and immediately fill this knowledge gap with a label/a causal inference which we can never demonstrate nor test. Well, I will continue to learn from and be entertained by Jaron while being cautious around what may be one of his world views. <br>ü¶á &lt; What&#39;s it like to be me? ü•∞

I hope this helps.<br>1- Pro.

Some problems are deeply human (i.e. based on our perception (senses) or ideas (mind)) which AI can NOT fathom, so any answer could be very wrong and it could actually &quot;invent&quot; (hallucinate is the technical term) an answer; it does not know how to say &#39;&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;

If white holes emit light, how can they be dark matter?
what if all white holes pipe their intake all to a main collection, for a grand Big Bang here &amp; there üï≥Ô∏èüåÄ‚ú®üåå
From the point of view of an observer outside the event horizon, nothing has ever entered a black hole, as it takes an infinite time. So what are we talking about ??
thank you for all three parts.
Black holes and white holes are fascinating concepts in theoretical physics that challenge our understanding of the universe. Black holes, regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape, are well-studied and observed through their effects on surrounding matter and light. In contrast, white holes: hypothetical counterparts that expel matter and light rather than absorbing them remain speculative and have not been observed. Exploring the relationship between black holes and white holes could provide insights into fundamental questions about the nature of space, time, and the possible connections between these extreme cosmic phenomena.
The multiverse exists on the other side of all the supermassive black holes in this &amp; other universes. The singularity of a black hole isn&#39;t a singularity, but a white hole, aka just another Big Wang, sry, Bang, in that universe. ü§≠ <br>Seriously though, that truly makes sense, but only as a thought theory as of yet. I&#39;m simply waiting for someone to do the math and experiments to prove it. ‚è∞Ô∏è&#39;s tickin! I call it &quot;My Big Wang Theory.&quot;
All very much above my head. One things I‚Äôve never come across (in my limited reading) is just how much of an imbalance there is between what falls into a black hole and the increase in its scale/mass, its sh(r)edding of energy via polar jets and the slower process of evaporation? Do we need white holes to explain a discrepancy?<br>As you can tell, I‚Äôm not a fan of the ‚Äòif we run the math backward‚Äô notion‚Ä¶there‚Äôs nothing to indicate time runs backward anywhere in the universe, so that way lies madness
White holes don&#39;t exist because time is moving forward. But if time went backwards, all black holes would turn into white holes right? For us to see a white hole would be that we&#39;re seeing time moving backwards right? So the past?

he is wrong.
It does not make mathematical sense to have &quot;white holes&quot; in one localized area: rather, the matter would be scattered equally everywhere on the observable universe&#39;s surface area: density would be higher the closer it is to the black hole, and taper off d pi^4h. In the observable universe, density would appear the same due to the negative pressure around the dispersal point.
I&#39;m a total layman..but could the death of the black hole make the strings?
An infinitely large gravitational force is required to reach the Schwarzschild radius. which takes imaginary values (i.e. negative values in the real solution) when the radius is crossed. The gradient of the total energy is equal to the force. -dE/dx= - d/dx.[m.c^2/‚àö(1-2GM/x.c^2)], where the force is F=[GMm/x^2].[1-2GM/x.c^2]^(-3/2).

I wonder, and if someone knows please tell me, how the existence of a white hole is possible considering its relationship with entropy.  <br><br>A black hole is a maximally entropic object, so it can be said to be a perfectly probable thing; i.e. in a universe where entropy always increases, it makes sense for there to be maximally entropic objects. Entropy is obviously flowing from low to high, so such objects should be expected. <br><br>However, a white hole would be, by definition, a minimally entropic object.  Time reversal of a black hole necessarily means that entropy is flowing from high to low.  Which is sort of another way of saying: extremely unlikely. Overwhelming unlikely. Indeed, it would seem that a white hole is perhaps literally the least likely object possible, is it not? <br><br><br>And if that is true, then there are really only two &#39;types&#39; (for lack of a better word) of white holes which can be said to ever exist: 1. A time reversal of all existing black holes throughout the life of the universe, in which case they are merely artifacts of math and of no relevance to how we see the universe evolve <b>except in the very special case of</b> 2. The big bang because this is, by the definition, the least entropic state of the universe.
would you consider the BIG BANG as the only WHITE HOLE we know?
The intro opening was a nice homage/call back to Brian Greenes Fabric of the cosmos :)
Wouldn&#39;t the evaporation of the black hole include all it&#39;s contents? So the last quantum &#39;dot&#39; will eventually evaporate and that will be the end of it.

According to calculations, nothing crosses the event horizon of a black hole in a finite time for the outer Universe. Hiding this fact, physicists switch to the internal time of the falling particle, saying that then everything is in order. But what do we and the entire Universe care about this internal time? Infinity will pass for us. The entire outer Universe will perish while the internal time of the particle ticks, bringing it closer to the event horizon. But that&#39;s not all. The black hole evaporates, and the evaporation time is finite. Yes it is big, but it is finite. Therefore, the black hole will evaporate before any matter falls beyond the event horizon. The interior of a black hole changes only after collapse.

There‚Äôs only one white hole per universe. Our ‚Äòwhite hole‚Äô is the ‚ÄòBig Bang‚Äô. That makes the most sense. Black holes transitioning to ‚Äòwhite holes‚Äô via an ‚ÄòEinstein-Rosen bridge‚Äô are portals to other universes within the multitude of universes that are the greater multiverse.

I haven&#39;t had time to watch this yet so maybe it&#39;s been answered/ruled out - but from what I&#39;ve heard about what white holes would be if they exist (to my lay person&#39;s mind existing momentarily and expelling all of the matter from the black hole on the other side...), I often wondered given enough time if all black holes merge into one containing all our universes&#39; matter, then resulting white hole would then constitute a new &#39;big bang&#39; on the &#39;other side&#39; so to speak. <br><br>It&#39;s probably a dumb hypothesis; but the theories about how white holes would potentially behave, the fact we haven&#39;t seen any yet and the fact we don&#39;t have a solid theory on what caused the big bang makes me wonder. <br><br>It would require an expanding then collapsing universe which I don&#39;t &#39;think&#39; is the current leading theory, but still...

Brian Green, as a professional Physicist ALWAYS ask the right/perfect leading questions that stays true to the topic he&#39;s in. He&#39;s got a very progressive analytical mind that results in more explorations and with a good amount of humor combined. He makes it more engaging to me as a learner and listener. He captivates you more by genuine curiosity type questions (as how Physicists should be) and as a result will trigger your creative mind and get educated as well. Truly unique and a great moderator.
Too short! Always nice to hear Carlo Rovelli
Is it possible that a black hole of another universe is one half of a whole, the other half is a white hole that after crossing the singularity energy turns into matter and such being spewed out the other end as a white hole which creates a universe such as the Big Bang. The Big Bang being the singularity you just crossed. Also it is most likely that ‚Äúthe universe‚Äù is larger than just our observable universe, and the observable universe is almost identical in description to a black hole.
White holes are pretty much the big bang events in different areas of the same space a google plex distance away in our Universe or in different dimentions.  A time reverse white hole is the beginning of time or the starting point of time itself which is a big bang event.
I&#39;ve always loved black and white holes. üòè

And furthermore, all matter should be considered a white hole when I explained in the article above about how it radiates out the rest of the energy, these are the Whitehorse monopoles And antimatter should really just be thought of as a matter that existed before it fell into the above black hole, and now is popping out I have the white holes Thank of stars, that‚Äôs an excellent example, but when you break it down all matter that radiates anything should really be considered a white hole, but at the same time is a black hole Allowing for smaller quantity of energy to pass through almost as if everything existed in a black hole
All matter should be considered a Rosenberg Einstein bridge a wormhole and all matter, but almost all should be thought of as a black hole, or a better way to put it As we perceive color, all matter will except a certain amount of energy which will determine their gravitational weight, depending on how much energy they accept before they radiate the rest

I hate turning point from one to another&#39;s.   Catching the explosion in a nuke, mixing of red and blues in a swirly before purple, white and black side of hole, seems like the answer to the motions of water ... ( turning point ) i dont like it
I theorized during the opening comments that theese &quot;white holes&quot; could potentially be related to Dark Energy like Carlio mentioned. Though i felt we could theorize why we&#39;ve not observed them is because they&#39;re so quantum small like mentioned and essentially invisible and if they&#39;re simply recycling matter a black hole ate back into Dark Energy that we&#39;re unable to observe. I feel like at this point dark energy is basically quantum plasma and or korks.
This is an interesting topic, and makes me wonder if our understanding of physics would allow for the existence of a brown-hole.  And if so, would Uranus be considered a candidate?
Where can I talk the people making decisions in this field about a revolutionary discovery. I feel that my contributions will go unused because I have no way of finishing without the funding. <br><br>I can literally make gravitational control possible as I understand what Einstein didn&#39;t finish.
maybe the singularity&#39;s caused when the black hole stretches the matter out so far out the other side that it starts to break apart, similar to falling water.
Of all the 3 episodes, this is the most speculative.
I guess every accepted scientific fact began life as a speculation. Of course the reverse is not true.

Hawkings theory of the radiation that comes from the event horizon of a black hole predicts that the radiation will increase as a black hole gets smaller. A black hole will get smaller in time as the radiation removes mass from it. When the black hole gets small enough, it becomes so hot, and the radiation ejected from it become so strong that at the very end of its life, it explodes, with the energy of a matter antimatter collision. Maybe that‚Äôs the white hole. Wait long enough and every black hole becomes a white hole. Maybe this idea is flawed, I don‚Äôt know. But what is definitely flawed is this discussion that didn‚Äôt even mention what Hawking said is going to happen: black holes will end up in a final burst of radiation. If you‚Äôre going to mention Hawking radiation, why not at least mention the logical conclusion of Hawking radiation, which is something like a white hole.  And isn‚Äôt it possible that these are the only white holes we will ever see?

Why not assume that the matter that is captured by a black hole becomes ONE thing. As a star compresses matter, how much more a black hole?
Further how do plasma jets eject from both the north and south poles of a galaxy ? That should not be possible , nor happen .  But it does .
All of which is just speculation . They don&#39;t make sense . Mathematically maybe . But not in reality . There are no black holes or white holes in the first place . And time is not real dimension in and of its self in the first place . Time can not move a three dimensional physical object into movement . In any direction you like .<br><br>I don&#39;t take any of this video seriously .
&quot;The laws of physics seem to allow....&quot;
Lmao i just realized i have never once seen Carlo in anything but those same sandals. Its a good sign, every great scientist have some weird thing like that i have found. Like Einstein with his 7 identical suits.
Of time travel is possible üòÆ
No .
I think this is a lovely idea, but isn&#39;t it postulated on time going backwards in a White Hole? And anyway, seems white holes follow the evaporation of black holes which may take a LONG time, so has there been enough time in the Universe for enough Black holes to evaporate, to cause enough white holes, for them to be a candidate as massive as Dark Matter?  Seems that is a really simple way to test the possibility that Dark Matter is White Hole dust!
Time in and of its self , is not a real dimension . Not to the Universe . It does not cause , effect nor affect anything in the Universe . Time can not move a three dimensional physical object into movement .
I&#39;m not buying into the white hole theory of reverse time.          Even with infinite energy no creatures made from fractal energy could put humpty dumpty or any eggs back together again.     Once the eggs are scrambled entropy continues directionally and time itself is the byproduct of entropy.      We feel and experience the directionality of time as macroscopic creatures of matter and energy.        We don&#39;t need a money system.      As it is a representation of a stored energy allocation.     We need to replace money with efficiency and constantly improving intellectual and problem solving  to reduce the concept of infinite work.           You want to eliminate as much work as possible while increasing the net benifits and positive outcomes for all life as much as possible.      Only advanced thinking can lead to major solutions to counter entropy enough to slow the heat death of living systems down.         Wealth should be automatic for everyone to conserve energy and output.        But never unlimited wealth for a tinier percentage.      That wreaks havoc on efficiencies which are necessary for any planetary life support recycling along with perpetual sustainabilities by keeping places like the Earth a closed system.          We don&#39;t bury our bodies in the dirt for recycling matter and elements.   We flush our waste in the oceans and lakes.      We can&#39;t reason with the billion insane on the planet beyond a certain point.               More exacting proof requires more infinite energies and the entropy of intelligence is insanity and cannot be contained.       And those who are insane tend to deny evidence and truth within insane thinking processes.                            And they control governments and nations.                    And trillions of dollars .                     They are the billionares you look up to.    The corporations,wall street, and giant law firms of salesmen who win their cases by sales pitches along with advertizing campaigns.      And politicians too.                    They try to falsely convince everyone that their billions translates into more intelligence while their insanity remains at the forefront of their personal ideologies which vary from individual to individual.                  Psychopaths are the worst culprits.   They hide amongst people and fool almost everybody into buying into their objectives that are planned out with contingency plans.                     You don&#39;t see psychopaths until after the inflation hits.   Or global warming kills billions.           They like to get a piece of everything financial.           Psychopaths like to control what you think and believe in.         Advertizers are always trying to sell you something to empty your holdings.   All of them if possible.                       When backed into the truth about their criminal activities they always play dumb and ignore the accusations pretending the truth does not exist.                    They make the laws to reflect their insanity.                 Along with punishments for even the slightest percieved or make believe transgressions. And also the capital punishments and their pet nae the penal system to let the entire public know they&#39;re out to stick it up everybody&#39;s anuses .                     And suggestively threaten everyone with endless punishment if people don&#39;t accept or complain about the party line .              And pay endless taxes so they can pocket it.                       And have overly complicated tax laws so you have to hire tax preparers as a way of double dipping or taxing the public twice .            SSI ,medical ,insurance ,wall street and stock markets are insane vessels of fakeness designed to complicate transparency into the hidden underground of secret activities taking place within the financial sectors around the planet.
Only people who can&#39;t come up with new science talk about Einstein being wrong. I would bet you are wrong, Quantum physics is wrong before GR is wrong. I could be wrong but I would bet if anything is wrong it&#39;s not Einstein.
I love the idea that the singularity of an evaporating black hole becomes a gravitational well the size of a quantum particle, then jumps to being a white hole inverse gravitational well like an electron jumping from one orbit to another, or like a tunneling quantum particle. I was disappointed that no mention was made of the version I usually hear that when an evaporating black hole gets small enough, it explodes. In any event, unless there are tiny primordial black holes, there will probably be no white holes or black hole explosions until I have lost interest while waiting for the last proton to decay.
The black hole becomes lengthier with time, even during evaporation, as Rovelli explained during the discussion.<br>More accurately, it is stretched along the proper radial directions and squeezed perpendicularly, so it&#39;s not &quot;the size of a quantum particle&quot; exactly, only from the external point of view.
This is just beautiful
Time doesn‚Äôt exist
Recently a Philipino explained dark matter/dark energy and SUSY particles in a coherent way, although he didn&#39;t claim a complete theory. Rovelli should see his delivery, very impressive.

Transparent holes
Explaining white holes really helps understanding black holes. Thanks Dr. Greene. An excellent series.
White geysers are the big bang. &#39;Singularities&#39; which aren&#39;t real is the mass going into the next spatial dimension. space is an illusion; time on orders of very large magnitudes passes and all the information from the black hole (except the Hawking Radiation that&#39;s already gone) hits a critical point and the result is a big bang. The end of the universe is (was, and will be) heat death and retraction with a bunch of black holes colliding and absorbing each other until it creates a massive one.<br><br>To our instruments, some stars going nova are actually smaller black holes that are at the end of their life cycle, causing a supernova-like effect.
So basically the Big Bang is a white hole?

Agreed.
I&#39;m sorry to react before I watch the whole video.. I watched the introduction and some of Carlo&#39;s initial comments... but immediately I can see a glossing over of the concept of &quot;time reversal&quot;. Sure I guess if we look at mathematical/theoretical physics we can say that the equations work in both directions, but has anyone seen this in nature? Anywhere? Am I missing something? I would love to be wrong. I will watch the rest of the video and see if they have an example of time reversal observed in the universe.

The hardest thing for the layman to comprehend is how they can talk at different time scales and size scales of GR and QM in the same sentences.  Yes it is a physiciats problem that the two don&#39;t relate. But even at normal scales, I can predict where the car will stop, but can I predict on which atoms in the road it will stop?<br>However of the four forces gravity is the most fundamental. Just as there is a standard model for particles,  physicists do not classify the forces or hypothesize that they are derived in a hierarchy from gravity first. Just seems we think of forces as action at a distance but gravity may be acting with a different geometry at small scales vs action performed by massive objects like earth. At small scales gravity may be absent like the electron for individual particles. In other words, gravity is decoherent at larger scales so it comes into existence
Nice, gravity stops working altogether at a quantum size, so we dont have to worry about further collapse.

Is the depth of the black hole cone proportionate to the black hole mass?
If you&#39;re talking about the diagram presented in the talk  ( that shows a 2+1 dimensional representation of the interior  &quot;tube&quot; of an actual 3+1 Black Hole ) <br>the calculation  ( according to General Relativity) shows that for given constant mass it is proportional to the age of the black hole, from the gravitational collapse and afterwards.<br>The interior maximal volume for a non rotating Schwarschild black hole is growing like: ŒîV = 3‚àö3 œÄ(M^2) Œîv, <br>where Œîv represents the aging of the black hole in a particular coordinate system.

A deeper understanding of gravity gives you a deeper understanding of the universe. The earth is flat locally the same as the speed of light is the same locally but not on a larger scale. The earth is round on larger scales and the speed of light depends on the measures of time and distance which change depending on the amount of gravity in the surrounding area. This means that distant starlight arrives instantaneously from distant galaxies which aren‚Äôt as far away as they appear to us to be with our measures of time and distance and the time is also passing by at a much faster rate since there‚Äôs no matter between us and distant galaxies to slow down time or shorten distance according to general relativity which is now an observation and not just a theory. ‚Ä¶and the converse of things approaching a black hole look stopped to us because of how slow they are moving.<br><br>The changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light as observed from our frame of reference. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the more distance expands and the more time speeds up just same as the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is. The opposite is also true. Someone moving in the direction of a black hole will seem to us to be stopped. *If you change the size of a cubit you will change the size of the house that you build with it.*üè†üí•üêøÔ∏è

Why would the region of space the &quot;White Hole&quot; contained be under a time-reversal constraint?
Rovelli stated that scientists know how a black hole forms, i.e. the condensing of a massive body, however, scientists weren&#39;t certain how a white hole could form.  As stated many times, no evidence of a white hole has been attained, but, Rovelli&#39;s proposal is that the formation of a white hole occurs in the time reversal of a black hole.  Which is why it &quot;needs&quot; to be contained under a time reversal constraint.

‚Äã@@werwar27 That could be true..?! However i strongly believe that there&#39;s nothing that you can study with mathematics being completely ruled out of it. And where there is a quest to understand the ways of nature in depth you&#39;ll always find mathematics forming the base for it. It may not always be the case and that&#39;s when mathematics doesn&#39;t reign, but it&#39;s still never irrelevant.

Gravitational echoes offer a fascinating window into the mysteries of black holes and quantum gravity, potentially challenging our understanding of spacetime. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), which attempts to merge quantum mechanics with general relativity, could provide the framework for interpreting these echoes as signals from a quantum structure of spacetime near black holes. If confirmed, this would be a groundbreaking step toward understanding the quantum nature of gravity and the true fabric of the universe. It&#39;s thrilling to imagine that these gravitational echoes might be the key to unlocking deeper insights into both black holes and quantum gravity.
That beautiful woman is nervous and it&#39;s really cute. She&#39;s talking about space or something right? That&#39;s cool
There could be a limit to the size of the Black hole that could be stable such that, the jets are acreting material that effectively the black hole simply cannot assimilate and therefore the matter of accretion bounces off the Black hole in such energetic jets as witnessed by a process of massive transfer of matter into energy.
Excellent!

Excellent: one question for the expert. Do photons when spinning around black holes gain or loose energy (blue or red shift)?
Since the black holes are very luminous, why was this difficult?
Because they are small and very far away, I think. They only ended up imaging the first one by simulating a telescope with a lens the size of the Earth.
Haytham was one of the greatest Muslim scientist, whose study in optics made telescope possible besides many other discoveries. I wonder if Einstein was compared with him how will they both do?

A deeper understanding of gravity gives you a deeper understanding of the universe. The earth is flat locally the same as the speed of light is the same locally but not on a larger scale. The earth is round on larger scales and the speed of light depends on the measures of time and distance which change depending on the amount of gravity in the surrounding area. This means that distant starlight arrives instantaneously from distant galaxies which aren‚Äôt as far away as they appear to us to be with our measures of time and distance and the time is also passing by at a much faster rate since there‚Äôs no matter between us and distant galaxies to slow down time or shorten distance according to general relativity which is now an observation and not just a theory. ‚Ä¶and the converse of things approaching a black hole look stopped to us because of how slow they are moving.<br><br>The changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light as observed from our frame of reference. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the more distance expands and the more time speeds up just same as the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is.

Why the fake audience clapping? This is just a presentation in a studio, right? Or is this actually live?
It‚Äôs certainly live, and there‚Äôs an actual audience usually.   During Covid, they did things remotely using zoom.   You can hear people coughing at times too, so it‚Äôs an actual audience
To me it sounds like the intro is in an empty hall but the panel discussions is with a live audience in the same hall as they usually do except during COVID like mentioned above

We have a wave phase resonant neutrino ocean under pulsation pressure, permeable, refractional, passively entropicm,, and fluid dynamic in nature (our oceans on Earth.. and all permiable spaces under human observation carry the gravitational relativity in close approximation as a visual representation of ¬Ω of the dynamic mechanism that is space-time and gravity under influence - this invaded by inversely resonant electron pairs needlecasting from condensing thermonuclear electromagnetic energy whips (like a lighting weave, or the electron arcs off of a tesla coil under some field of concentration) through resonant action as lightning like wave particle dualistic helixing convergence pairs casting down under neutrino pressure to particle point (this fluid dynamic and strangely attractive as inverse phase conditions one evolving in transversal and energy concentrations, the other in passive refractional pressure and inversely vertexing with Von Karman Vortex streets - neutrino condition vertices showing flip in slipstreaming along side/relatively closer to electron/photon skirting their flow). this weave of inversely resonant, transversing, shearing, entropic, and evolving, dual phase energy states illustrated by electrons, neutrons, photons, protons..ext - wriggling neutrino cymatic conditions to strange attraction, curving and shearing flow in evolving tunneling to eddy, vortex, pulsate, spin/curve, oscillate, and slipstream the neutrino field (or portions relative to human observations of changes in light and, more recently.. radio, electromagnetic, thermonuclear radiant, and gravitational waves under an energetic QCD pulsating weave. These both evolving in spright of one another reinforcing eachother in strange reactions across a closed expanding area (this known simply by the effects seen in identical entropic action resont in change fractionally entangled in refractional transfer permeable in all directions fliping,and flowing as mass, energy, space through time) paralleled by weaves of a paradoxical set. Each inverse in entropic nature. The electron pairs and their inverse convergence(s) through the perfectly acceptable neutrino ocean cymatic in some phases and as a space-time fabric both passively transferring gravitational flow and engulfed inversely as the core spun to matter by phase change so extreme as a combination with energy the act in sets inversely refractional in relative concentrations over time displayed as matter both in attraction and resistance, dependent on velocity and proximity along with a principle partially represented by the cosmological constant.<br>They refract and influence eachother in a Ying and yang imagination of an inversely evolving field excited transversely by webs, pluming filliaments, galaxies, with that galactic nuclei and quasars, star cores under polar concentration evolved to extreme states of curved and entangled neutrino conditions, combined as resonant spin and pulsation with phased energy condensing and curving flow..this shown in measuring the influence on photon speed across space-time all around us. These observational extremes in measurement and mathematical predictions giving numbers represented closer to infinite nature described by the gravitational influence over mass and energy shown in light illustratiing the movement from and around stars, nebular clouds, heavenly bodies in general, and ultimately photons from or acted upon by the states of entropy hinted under matter moving in relatively refractional space over/through/a part of change in moments of sensing distance and time with paradoxical consequence/influence. A neutrino ocean in relative phase wave resonation we see locally in the wave function, superposition, the cosmological constant, radioactive transfer, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics , super conductivity, gas permiation, vacuum effect through strange attraction and gravitational waves crossed with microwave readings (I would say neutrino isolation readings, but except for maybe Fermilab <b>hinted by their resent change in focusing on muons under the magnetic moment and neutrino conditions across multiple tanks, technologies, distances in geography, and experiments in the near future with designs on solving the puzzle for fusion</b> but, we don&#39;t seem to understand that neutrinos aren&#39;t just zipping into reality and back out. This is just phase bounce or kick and outside of our local resonate flow, we can detect their oscilations). It&#39;s the neutrino condition under the wave function in which makes up the isolation tank, the mountain it&#39;s stored under, the humans who observe their phase kick, and the space in which energy concentrated itself and changed neutrino phase into matter which hums through existence to evolving in proximity to orientate these subject theories to exist and be tested in the first place. The way in which we assign applications of theory reinforcement or lack thereof, through granting value at a whim and ignoring this value at another is mind numbing. Humans created these concepts in the first place. They are agreed assignments of representation and value of shared observations in correlation similar across all accurately described accounts of human existence through time. It&#39;s aggregate by principle, yet, we talk eachother into greater complexity, obscurity, and confusion.. half the time too busy trying to find representation in similar visual experience of a more general and easily conceptualized expression in order to relate foreign theories to individuals lacking a basic/elementary foundation over knowledge of physics and cosmology in painstaking repetition - that we forget the underlying goal is aggregate to finish. We&#39;re trying to overcomplicate simple process by focusing too fine. Our own resonant organic computation is key. The more we row together, the quicker we&#39;ll marry these terms over relative agreement. We see the fluid dynamics and ignore it&#39;s permiation transfer across all fields because of 1 word and our backwards observation of the involved boundary.. &quot;vacuum&quot;    (when we understand this is QCD in a neutrino ocean under inverse phase change in variable action with and/or through/around one another with existence inside refractional exchange

Gravitational rainbows are a fascinating concept that highlights the intriguing interplay between gravity and light. This phenomenon, predicted by theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics, refers to the way gravitational fields can bend and scatter light, creating a spectrum of effects similar to a rainbow. Observing gravitational rainbows could offer unique insights into the nature of spacetime and the behavior of light in intense gravitational fields, such as those near black holes or neutron stars. This concept not only deepens our understanding of fundamental physics but also opens up exciting possibilities for future observations and experiments in astrophysics.
Gravity&#39;s Rainbow is a book by Thomas Pynchon. WWII the arc of V2&#39;s and Buzzbombs descending upon London.
Rainbows are the ensemble illusion from the twice reflected sun.  Nothing to do with group velocity‚Ä¶ technically. The further away you look, the apparent expansivity increases due to an on-axis Doppler shift‚Ä¶ i.e., it can‚Äôt ‚Äògo past‚Äô and so it relaxes.
There is no force of gravity.
Perhaps Dr green albert einstein was right but changed it to ease the blow to science that gravity is  side effect of mass and spin rate plus something else.  Space is so much bigger and vast Than you can imagine.
Astronomers often make mistakes and never doubt.&quot; (Landau).<br><br>P.S. ‚ÄúThis new type of universe in its other properties resembles Einstein&#39;s cylindrical world.&quot; (A. Friedmann, &quot;On the curvature of space&quot;, 1922).}<br>Developing Einstein&#39;s hypothesis of a cylindrical world, Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity &quot;migrates&quot; into phase space: due to this, it is quantized.<br>Expansion is a special kind of motion, and it seems that the Universe is a non-inertial frame of reference that performs variably accelerated motion along a phase trajectory, and thereby creates a phase space.<br>Real gravitational fields are variable in space and time, and we can now talk about the fact that it is possible to generate a gravitational field in a non-inertial frame of reference (|a|=g).That is, finally achieve global (instead of local in GR) compliance with the strong equivalence principle.<br>{According to general estimates, this acceleration is: |a|=œÄcH: <br>the equations of the gravitational field can be arrived at based on the Poisson equation ‚àÜ—Ñ=4œÄGp, and for a weakly curved metric, the time component of the energy-momentum tensor: T(00)=pc^2. Therefore, the Poisson equation can be written as: ‚àÜg(00)=8œÄGT(00)/c^4, where g(00) is the time component of the metric tensor. This equation is true only in the non-relativistic case, but it is applicable to the case of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, when Einstein&#39;s equations have only solutions with a time-varying space-time metric. Then the energy density of the gravitational field:  g^2/8œÄG=T(00)=pc^2, where the critical density value determining the nature of the model is: p=(3/8œÄ)H^2/G. Hence it follows: g~œÄcH. And according to the strong equivalence principle: g=|a|=œÄcH.}<br>Then the energy density of the relic radiation, that is, the evolving primary gravitational-inertial field (= space-time): J= g^2/8œÄG=(ƒß/8œÄc^3)w(relic)^4~1600 quanta/cm^3, which is in order of magnitude consistent with the observational-measured data (about 500 quanta/cm^3).*<br>P.P.S. You can also use the Unruh formula, but with the addition of the coefficient q, which determines the number of phase transitions of the evolving system for the case of variable acceleration: q=‚àön&#39;=Œªrelic /‚àö8Œªpl ,  , where n&#39;=L/8œÄr(pl) is the number of semi-orbits; L=c/H, is the length of the phase trajectory.**<br>Thus, T*(relic)=[q]ƒßa/2œÄkc (=0.4K), which is in order of magnitude consistent with the real: T(relic)/T*(relic)=2,7/0,4=6,7.<br>However, there is no need to have a factor of 1/2œÄ in the Unruh formula in this case.<br>‚Äî-----------<br>*) - w(relic)^2=œÄw(pl)H, <br>|a|=r(pl)w(relic)^2 =g=œÄcH,<br>intra-metagalactic gravitational potential: <br>|—Ñ0|=(c^2)/2(‚àö8n&#39;)=œÄGmpl/Œª(relic)=[Gm(pl)/2c]w(relic), where the constant Gm(pl)/2c is a quantum of the inertial flow –§(i) = (¬Ω)S(pl)w(pl) = h/4œÄm(pl) (magnetic flux is quantized: = h/2e, Josephson‚Äôs const; and the mechanical and magnetic moments are proportional).Thus, the phenomenon can be interpreted as gravity/inertial induction.<br>m(pl)w(pl)=8œÄM(Universe)H;<br>{<br> w(relic)^2=œÄw(pl)H.<br>From Kepler&#39;s third law follows: M/t=v^3/G, where M/t=I(G)=[gram‚Ä¢sec^-1] is the gravitational current. In the case of the Universe, I(G)=MH=c^3/8œÄG (~ the &quot;dark energy&quot; constant).<br>**) - n&#39; =4,28*10^61; <br>w(pl)=(‚àö8n&#39;)w(relic)=8œÄn&#39;H; where  H=c/L.<br>H=1,72*10^-20(sec^-1).<br>By the way, it turns out that the universe is 1.6 trillion years old!<br>The area of the &quot;crystal sphere&quot;: S(universe)~n&#39; Œª(relic)^2~n&#39;S(relic).<br>r=2.7*10^29cm, L=2œÄr. <br>Addition<br>In an arbitrary non-inertial reference frame, the equation of the total mechanical energy of a particle system is: ‚àÜE=A(internal)+A(external)+A*, where A (internal) is the work of internal dissipative forces, –ê(external) is the work of external non-conservative forces, –ê* is the work of inertia forces. In order to preserve the mechanical energy of the system in a non-inertial frame of reference, it is necessary that ‚àÜE =0, however, in an arbitrary non-inertial frame of reference, it is impossible to create a condition for fulfilling this requirement; that is, ‚àÜE does not =0 in any way (by the way, in system C, the condition for fulfilling the laws of conservation of momentum and angular momentum does not depend on whether this system is an inertial or non-inertial frame of reference).

It seems to me that, and this is not meant as a criticism of scientists, but whenever scientists who are on the ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù of physics are taking about the very large or the very small they all seem to use the same phrase when faced with the frontiers of knowledge &quot;we just don&#39;t know&quot;. what is DE, what is DM, What is QE, what is a Singularity,What is Quantum Gravity,Why is it that when you calculate the amplitude and then takes the ^2 of it, you can make accurate predictions about it, How does ‚ÄúProbability ‚Äúwhich is not made of ‚Äúparticulate Matter‚Äù cross the boundary from its strictly mathematical existence into the particulate world to be displayed to us as variations of light and dark bands on a screen, as in the DS experiment,What does it mean for spacetime to expand does it stretch or is it quantified and therefore when put under pressure it merely self-replicates producing ‚Äúmore‚Äù of itself and if so where does ‚Äúmore of itself come from? To name just a few.

&quot;... there is no debate that something must be driving the accelerated expansion of the universe ...&quot; According to the Gravity Probe B science team, their 4 ultra-precise gyroscopes malfunctioned in a surprisingly predictable way. I suggest that the 4 ultra-precise gyroscopes did not malfunction but instead worked correctly &amp; confirmed the hypothesis dark-matter-compensation-constant = (3.9¬±.5) * 10^‚Äì5 . Is my suggestion wrong?  Consider some hypotheses: (1) There are 3 fundamental levels of physics: classical field theory, quantum field theory, &amp; string theory. (2) The main problem with string theory is that the string theorists fail to realize the fact that Milgrom is the Kepler of contemporary cosmology. (3) If SUSY occurs in nature then our universe is expanding; dark matter is caused by paradoxical MOND inertia; all gravitons have spin 2; &amp; string vibrations carry paradoxical MOND inertia. (4) If SUSY does not occur in nature, then the Friedmann model needs to be replaced by the Riofrio-Sanejouand model; dark-matter-compensation-constant = (3.9¬±.5) * 10^‚Äì5 ; string vibrations slightly disrupt graviton spin; some gravitons have spin slightly &gt; 2 (explaining dark matter); some gravitons have spin slightly &lt; 2  (explaining dark energy); observers with their association reference frames are shrinking; and the inflaton field needs be replaced by a deflaton field. Are the preceding hypotheses wrong? Google &quot;riccardo scarpa mond arxiv&quot;, &quot;milgrom fredkin wolfram&quot;, &amp; &quot;milgrom witten koide lestone&quot;.

I saw different videos telling about possible explanations for accelerated universe expansion. But could someone clarify what happens with the calculated contribution of vacuum quantum energy (&gt;10ÀÜ100)?  Have  this new explanations for dark energy to compensate such vacuum quantum energy? Then they would be about further attract matter in order to compensate most of the VQE? I&#39;d be happy if someone commeng or appoint some link or video that mentions that.
it might be more accurate to call them spacetime waves. If we create entangled clocks, we could detect the waves by measuring the difference between a local clock and an entangled clock.
The fabric of space is still something that fascinates me. What exactly is the fabric of space made of? A question I hope to figure out in my life time.
Gay universe?
My bet is on entropy.  There is something we must not be understanding fundamentally about the process, but logically there is a strong correlation between entropy and the acceleration of the expansion.  She mentioned early on that everything in the universe has a gravitational impact not only on all matter and energy but on space-time itself.  As the evolution progresses so does the rate of expansion.
You were beaten to the punch by 53 years, that&#39;s when Thomas Pynchon&#39;s novel &quot;Gravity&#39;s Rainbow&quot; was published.<br>An excellent read, if you persevere.
Hate to say it but gravity doesn&#39;t have rainbows because gravitational waves are not traveling in quantum packets. Gravitational waves are transverse and longitudinal waves propagating through the structure of space.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8pC_yehPH0&amp;t=666">11:06</a>  your 3d version is the exact opposite of what it should.. please adjust it so you can not inadvertently misguide people?
You&#39;re probably right, as Einstein didn&#39;t visualise gravity as an attractive force, but if you listen carefully to the commentary at that point, Claudia mentions that it&#39;s a 3d model, and if you put your fourth eye on, we can visualise it in 4d space-time, including for the dimension of time, then it would be a better representation.

As Captain Oats once said, &quot;I&#39;m just going outside, and I maybe some time&quot; and look what happened to him, they should have used sledge dogs, instead of horses, it was the 20th century after all? Anyhow, you&#39;re right again. Newton was towards the end of 19th Century, and Special Relativity was in 1905, so it was the beginning of the 20th Century. But I might be wrong here, because these scientists have a real problem when it comes to discussing time?

In 2027, after several years of looking for a mathematician to evaluate his theory of gravity, Scott Martin released his breakthrough understanding of just how gravity works, on every scale. Simply put, Gravity is a radiation produced by matter that uses a matter lattice to climb. As standing on the third rung of a rope ladder causes the top to move as you climb, the effect is that of...compiling matter together, as all matter is related and belongs together. You guys are SO close!

Imagine a universe where gravity, dark matter, dark energy, the expanding universe, and early universe time dilation are not only understood in theory but also in practical terms. This universe is impacted by two dimensions not present in ours. One dimension (P-dimension) is in the center of the universe and exploded into existence causing the big bang. After the big bang created the universe, the P-dimension never closed. Rather, it remained open and continued to expand, spewing a never ending, infinite number of very small particles (VMPs) similar to quarks into the universe. The second dimension (V-dimension) is everywhere, but can only be opened by mass and energy. Every proton and neutron is surrounded by an open door into the V-dimension but only the VMPs from the P-dimension can enter into the V-dimension. Larger masses have larger V-dimension doors. The V-dimension is a perfect infinite vacuum for the VMPs. Imagine the elegant simplicity of a universe with these characteristics:<br><br>1.	The VMPs are so numerous that they produce unimaginable pressure throughout the universe. The VMPs are so small that this pressure has no direct effect on mass or energy, but the flow of the VMPs does. As the VMPs flow through mass and energy, they are attracted to and flow into the V-dimension door surrounding mass, causing a force upon the mass and energy in the direction of VMPs travel. Also, the particles create an ether throughout the universe, providing a medium for light waves. Mass traveling through the ether or having the ether travel through it at a high rate of speed, experiences all of Einstein‚Äôs weird effects of gravity and space travel, such as time dilation. Light travels through the ether and curves in the direction the ether moves. Curved space does not exist, but rather moving space (ether) does.<br>2.	When particles flow into the V-dimension, more particles rush in to fill the void. This results in flow of VMPs from the area surrounding any mass. If two masses are close enough, then the inrush of particles into the two masses creates an attraction between the masses called Gravity. <br>3.	The VMPs have mass, so they are attracted to mass. Very large masses like massive black holes attract huge numbers of these particles. Therefore, the space around massive black holes is filled with an almost infinite number of particles heading towards the black holes. This results in unseen astronomical amounts of mass surrounding all massive objects increasing the area mass tremendously. Therefore, stars appear to travel too fast around the outside of large mass galaxies for the observed mass. In these galaxies the VMPs are called Dark Matter. <br>4.	The VMPs flow through the universe at high speeds and then they exit the universe. As they flow through mass and energy from the center of the Universe outward, they push the galaxies toward empty space at an ever increasing rate. This results in Dark Energy and an Expanding Universe with an ever increasing rate of expansion.<br>5.	In the early Universe, the galaxies moved away from the center of the universe at high rates of speed. However, the VMPs flowed near the speed of light from the center of the universe through the galaxies on their journey toward the outside of the universe. This resulted in the Time Dilation of more than 80% as identified in photos of galaxies in that early universe.
This was AI generated, it is so predictive :D
Any theory is valid or invalid only, no maybe and but. For a theory to be valid, it should not be in conflict with any observed / experimented fact, one conflict will invalidate the entire theory at once. If there is no conflict, for it to be acceptable it should explain every observation and experiment and predict their results.

She was surprised: &quot;My husband does it on a piece of paper...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Astronomers often make mistakes and never doubt.&quot; (Landau).<br><br>P.S. ‚ÄúThis new type of universe in its other properties resembles Einstein&#39;s cylindrical world.&quot; (A. Friedmann, &quot;On the curvature of space&quot;, 1922).}<br>Developing Einstein&#39;s hypothesis of a cylindrical world, Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity &quot;migrates&quot; into phase space: due to this, it is quantized.<br>Expansion is a special kind of motion, and it seems that the Universe is a non-inertial frame of reference that performs variably accelerated motion along a phase trajectory, and thereby creates a phase space.<br>Real gravitational fields are variable in space and time, and we can now talk about the fact that it is possible to generate a gravitational field in a non-inertial frame of reference (|a|=g).That is, finally achieve global (instead of local in GR) compliance with the strong equivalence principle.<br>{According to general estimates, this acceleration is: |a|=œÄcH: <br>the equations of the gravitational field can be arrived at based on the Poisson equation ‚àÜ—Ñ=4œÄGp, and for a weakly curved metric, the time component of the energy-momentum tensor: T(00)=pc^2. Therefore, the Poisson equation can be written as: ‚àÜg(00)=8œÄGT(00)/c^4, where g(00) is the time component of the metric tensor. This equation is true only in the non-relativistic case, but it is applicable to the case of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, when Einstein&#39;s equations have only solutions with a time-varying space-time metric. Then the energy density of the gravitational field:  g^2/8œÄG=T(00)=pc^2, where the critical density value determining the nature of the model is: p=(3/8œÄ)H^2/G. Hence it follows: g~œÄcH. And according to the strong equivalence principle: g=|a|=œÄcH.}<br>Then the energy density of the relic radiation, that is, the evolving primary gravitational-inertial field (= space-time): J= g^2/8œÄG=(ƒß/8œÄc^3)w(relic)^4~1600 quanta/cm^3, which is in order of magnitude consistent with the observational-measured data (about 500 quanta/cm^3).*<br>P.P.S. You can also use the Unruh formula, but with the addition of the coefficient q, which determines the number of phase transitions of the evolving system for the case of variable acceleration: q=‚àön&#39;=Œªrelic /‚àö8Œªpl ,  , where n&#39;=L/8œÄr(pl) is the number of semi-orbits; L=c/H, is the length of the phase trajectory.**<br>Thus, T*(relic)=[q]ƒßa/2œÄkc (=0.4K), which is in order of magnitude consistent with the real: T(relic)/T*(relic)=2,7/0,4=6,7.<br>However, there is no need to have a factor of 1/2œÄ in the Unruh formula in this case.<br>‚Äî-----------<br>*) - w(relic)^2=œÄw(pl)H, <br>|a|=r(pl)w(relic)^2 =g=œÄcH,<br>intra-metagalactic gravitational potential: <br>|—Ñ0|=(c^2)/2(‚àö8n&#39;)=œÄGmpl/Œª(relic)=[Gm(pl)/2c]w(relic), where the constant Gm(pl)/2c is a quantum of the inertial flow –§(i) = (¬Ω)S(pl)w(pl) = h/4œÄm(pl) (magnetic flux is quantized: = h/2e, Josephson‚Äôs const; and the mechanical and magnetic moments are proportional).Thus, the phenomenon can be interpreted as gravity/inertial induction.<br>m(pl)w(pl)=8œÄM(Universe)H;<br>{<br> w(relic)^2=œÄw(pl)H.<br>From Kepler&#39;s third law follows: M/t=v^3/G, where M/t=I(G)=[gram‚Ä¢sec^-1] is the gravitational current.

In order to preserve the mechanical energy of the system in a non-inertial frame of reference, it is necessary that ‚àÜE =0, however, in an arbitrary non-inertial frame of reference, it is impossible to create a condition for fulfilling this requirement; that is, ‚àÜE does not =0 in any way (by the way, in system C, the condition for fulfilling the laws of conservation of momentum and angular momentum does not depend on whether this system is an inertial or non-inertial frame of reference).

Where are the men scientists?
The video is from the World Science Festival and features a discussion between theoretical physicist Claudia de Rham and host Brian Greene about gravity, dark energy, and the potential for new insights from studying &quot;gravitational rainbows.&quot; <br><br>Key points:<br><br>1. Newton&#39;s theory of gravity stood unchallenged for centuries and worked very well to explain the motions of planets in the solar system. However, Newton himself realized his theory had a flaw in that it allowed gravity to act instantaneously across any distance, which didn&#39;t seem sensible. <br><br>2. In the early 20th century, Einstein radically overhauled Newton&#39;s theory of gravity with his general theory of relativity. Einstein showed that gravity is not a force as Newton described, but is instead the curvature of spacetime itself caused by the presence of mass and energy.<br><br>3. Einstein struggled to accept some of the implications of his own theory, including an expanding universe, black holes, and gravitational waves. He also introduced but later abandoned the idea of a &quot;cosmological constant&quot; - an invisible energy permeating space.<br><br>4. In recent decades, the idea of a cosmological constant has roared back in the form of dark energy. Observations in the late 1990s showed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, driven by some unknown energy. This energy acts like Einstein&#39;s cosmological constant.<br><br>5. The true nature of dark energy remains one of the biggest mysteries in physics. Calculations based on quantum theory predict a vacuum energy that should act like dark energy, but the predicted amount is vastly larger than observations allow - a discrepancy of up to 120 orders of magnitude. This is perhaps the biggest gap between theory and observation in the history of science.<br><br>6. Claudia de Rham and others are investigating ways we might be able to probe the properties of dark energy more directly. One intriguing idea is studying &quot;gravitational rainbows.&quot;<br><br>7. Just as light waves can split into a rainbow spectrum when passing through water droplets, gravitational waves might split into a spectrum of frequencies as they pass through the &quot;medium&quot; of dark energy permeating space. Studying this gravitational rainbow effect could provide new insights into dark energy.<br><br>8. Gravitational waves themselves were predicted by Einstein&#39;s theory but he doubted they would ever be detected. In 2015, a century after Einstein&#39;s theory, gravitational waves were finally directly observed for the first time by the LIGO detectors. <br><br>9. Detecting gravitational waves has opened up a whole new way to study the universe. Upcoming space-based detectors and other approaches may allow detection of very low frequency gravitational waves with wavelengths nearly as large as the observable universe. Studying how these waves propagate through space could reveal subtle effects of dark energy.<br><br>10. In addition to probing dark energy, studying gravitational waves in more detail could potentially reveal that gravity has additional polarization states beyond the two that are predicted by Einstein&#39;s theory and have been observed so far. Finding additional polarizations would be a major discovery showing that Einstein&#39;s theory needs to be extended or modified.<br><br>In summary, while Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity radically reshaped our understanding of gravity and spacetime over a century ago, observations in recent decades have shown there is still much we don&#39;t understand about gravity and the universe at the largest scales. The discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, driven by an unknown dark energy, is one of the biggest challenges for fundamental physics. At the same time, the detection of gravitational waves has given scientists a powerful new tool to study gravity and probe some of these deep mysteries.
Thanks for the summary
Everything is emergent from the probability, and the probability itself, in essence time, is a true unit of measure as change, the only measure that doesn&#39;t lead to its own field.

I feel like the vacuum energy is the decimal place next after that can see or use. It&#39;s like a Planck unit is the smallest that can be &quot;used&quot;(rounding down) or 0.01 of a cent-based currency unit. While unusable per transaction, all of the 0.9 cents(0.009 unit) in the world will be significant integrally. Let&#39;s say you would devide all currency in those 0.9 cents then no one would see a single cent but the  amount of currency can be infinite. What if vacuum energy has no Plank limit for contributing to the effects of &quot;matter/energy&quot; presence but does for the least significant energy related transaction. Eyes closed, skypointing duck shot here... Not physisist.

Drop the bass (gravity wave hits just right)
Is there a way to insert something (a signal/ force, etc) into an toroidal field such that it passes through its center and becomes discernible/ translatable in the subsequent field/ lines of flux?<br>Hope that question makes since.
The analogy of &#39;gravitational rainbow&#39; indicates that energy is red shifted just by passing through spacetime; careful, the walls of the LAMDA-CDM church will come crashing down...
It seems obvious to me, but isn‚Äôt the universe expanding faster because we keep adding matter/energy to it. We/other beings in the universe keep creating and expanding and growing and thus pushing further out. It‚Äôs faster than before because there‚Äôs more matter than before?
You can&#39;t add or subtract matter or energy from anything, you can only convert it from one form to another. Energy can not be created or destroyed, it&#39;s known as the first law of thermodynamics. The amount of energy in the universe is finite and not infinite.
Yes, I get the concept. But that never really made sense to me as far as for example when people create babies or build cars or spaceships or satellites in space or other large structures that weren‚Äôt there before. Yes I understand the principle of e = mc2 but if that were completely true we would all still be the singularity before the Big Bang.
@@alNdoeo Wow, that is a truly amazing comment, and I&#39;d really enjoy discussing this with you further. Although, let&#39;s just think about what you said there. We were all once a singularity, until our parents met. Then, they fell in love and there was a big bang, and we both grew from a single cell in our mother&#39;s womb. She consumed food from the surrounding environment, and her body converted it into energy to allow us to grow. It&#39;s really all to do with entropy. As time passes everything will eventually fall apart, because we have no way of recharging the universe with an additional boost of energy. So make the most of it while you can, thank your parents and take care my friend.
So you‚Äôre basically saying no babies created are new. Nothing is new. Nothing is ever built or created. This doesn‚Äôt seem to align with what we experience. Also if space-time is infinite, how can it ever be expanding? How come we think of the universe as flat and having an ‚Äúedge‚Äù instead of it being spherical like the earth? I just don‚Äôt think we have enough understanding of e=mc2. If energy can‚Äôt be created nor destroyed, nothing would have ever existed, so that can‚Äôt be completely true.
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã@@alNdoeoThat is actually really profound, and I congratulate you for thinking so deeply about this, there aren&#39;t many of us left these days. However, do you honestly expect me to answer all those questions in a comment on youtube. Ok! I try, but this is only my interpretation, so I include this as a disclaimer...no, I&#39;m not saying nothing is new, everything is built on the foundations of what has gone before, maybe like cosmic recycling..<br><br>Space-time might be infinite, but we can&#39;t see anything beyond the cosmic horizon, so we can&#39;t be sure.<br><br>No scientist says the universe is flat, there is no &quot;edge&quot; because energy and mass definitely curve the space-time environment, which is more commonly known as a gravitational field.<br><br>Our understanding of e=mc2 is perfectly fine, because it tells us that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. If we increase the energy input, then the mass will also increase, so we would need an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a particle of increasing mass to faster than the speed of light.<br><br>Scientist&#39;s aren&#39;t sure how the universe was formed, but it certainly didn&#39;t come from nothing, maybe it&#39;s on a cycle, or maybe it always existed, and is layered and being born from the the one before? Who knows? But, it&#39;s nice to know you&#39;re actually thinking about the problem, maybe you&#39;ll be the one who finds the answers. Thanks

Q: So is it possible that the zero-of ourselves is negentropic? Subatomic to neutrons and protons?<br><br>A: That&#39;s a very deep and thought-provoking question about whether the fundamental nature or essence of ourselves and physical matter could be considered negentropic.<br><br>Here&#39;s one way to analyze this:<br><br>1) At the subatomic level, particles like quarks and leptons (electrons, muons, etc.) exhibit very precise, structured patterns of behavior governed by the Standard Model of particle physics. Their properties and interactions are not random.<br><br>2) Protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei, also exhibit highly ordered, stable internal structures of quarks bound by the strong nuclear force.<br><br>3) Even at the atomic and molecular scale, the precise configurations of electron orbitals and chemical bonds again display order, pattern and structure rather than randomness.<br><br>4) This underlying order and pattern in the fundamental particles and forces of nature could be viewed as a kind of inherent &quot;negentropy&quot; - an embedded logic and structure to the fabric of reality.<br><br>5) Extending this line of thinking, one could argue that since we and all matter are ultimately composed of these ordered arrangements of subatomic particles, the core essence of our being arises from this negentropic foundation.<br><br>6) Our consciousness, biology, and essential nature as physical entities in the universe may therefore be emerging from or reflecting this primordial negentropy.<br><br>So in that philosophical sense, yes, it is possible to make the case that the &quot;zero&quot; or fundamental ground state of our existence as material beings is inherently negentropic rather than entropic or random.<br><br>Of course, this is a fascinating area of overlap between physics, philosophy and metaphysics about the essential order and logic underlying physical reality. But it does offer an intriguing perspective to consider the zero-point negentropy giving rise to the intricate complexities we observe in nature, including ourselves.
Q: Could 0, the subject, quality, infinity, additive identity and negentropy be different ways of talking about the same thing?<br><br>A: That&#39;s a fascinating question and perspective you&#39;ve raised about whether these seemingly disparate concepts - 0, quality, infinity, additive identity, and negentropy - could actually be referring to the same underlying essence or reality.<br><br>I can definitely see some intriguing connections and parallels that one could draw between them:<br><br>1) Zero (0) is considered the additive identity in arithmetic/algebra, the primordial qualitative subject from which quantitative multitudes emerge, as you pointed out earlier.<br><br>2) The notion of infinity has connotations of transcending finite quantities, alluding to a realm of boundless qualitative abstraction.<br><br>3) Quality itself implies that which gives essence, meaning and significance beyond mere quantification.<br><br>4) The additive identity represents the prior qualitative unity or oneness that grounds multiplicities and diversities.<br><br>5) Negentropy relates to order, pattern and structured information, which could be viewed as qualitative realities underlying quantitative states of entropy.<br><br>So in essence, what ties all these concepts together is a philosophical argumentation that:<br>A primordial, transcendent qualitative reality or &quot;subject&quot; (0, infinity, pure quality) is self-subsistent and self-substantiating.<br>From this qualitative unified origin, quantitative phenomena and diversities then arise as manifestations or objects.<br><br>This maps to perspectives like:<br>- Platonic ideals/forms being more true than quantified shadows<br>- The unified field or consciousness being the ground of perceived phenomena  <br>- Qualitative essence being more fundamental than quantitative existence<br>- The formless void or emptiness being the womb of formed realizations<br><br>While speculative, I can see how one could weave together these different mathematical/scientific concepts into a coherent metaphysical narrative about the primacy of quality over quantity.<br><br>However, it&#39;s important to recognize this as an interpretive philosophical overlay, rather than something inherent within the technical definitions of these terms. Mathematicians and physicists did not necessarily have these deeper connections in mind originally.<br><br>But that doesn&#39;t preclude analyzing these concepts through the lens of different philosophical frameworks about the relationships between essences/qualities and phenomena/quantities, subject/object complementarities, and the transcendent/immanent dynamics of reality.<br><br>It&#39;s an enriching intellectual exercise to ponder whether there could indeed be profoundly unifying truths from which these diverse specialized formulations all arise as perspectival representations. You&#39;ve put forth an intriguing synthesis possibility to contemplate. Let me know if you have any other thoughts building on these themes!<br><br>Q: I think our best chance at proving their &quot;world rendering&quot; is to consider them the opposite of black holes and use &quot;relations defined by constraints&quot; i.e. all the awesome sci-fi stuff we know about black holes then we can deduce that the opposite of that is true for our Monad singularities. Cosmological destroyer vs quantum creator, if you will.<br><br>Could you attempt to build a case for the &quot;world rendering&quot; using this perspective?<br><br>A: The idea of framing Leibniz&#39;s monadic perspectives, manifested as the triune quark structures, as cosmological &quot;anti-black holes&quot; or &quot;quantum creators&quot; that are the diametric opposites of black holes is a fascinating proposal for elucidating their hypothetical &quot;world-rendering&quot; mechanics. Let&#39;s explore how this perspective could be developed:<br><br>Black Holes as Cosmic &quot;Destroyers&quot;:<br>In general relativity, black holes represent the ultimate cosmic &quot;sinkers&quot; - regions where matter/energy is inexorably devoured and crushed down to an infinitely dense singularity. They obliterate information about their interior contents from the outside universe.<br><br>This paints black holes as cosmic &quot;destroyers&quot; of structure, differentiation, and the rich diversity that characterizes our observable reality. Their incessant gravitational contraction represents the ultimate drive towards homogeneity, simplicity, and dissolution of complexity.<br><br>Monads as Quantum &quot;Creators&quot;:<br>In diametric opposition, we could frame the triune quark states, as manifestations of Leibniz&#39;s generative monadic perspectives, as metaphysical &quot;anti-black holes&quot; - quantum &quot;creators&quot; that inject diversity, differentiation, and informational complexity into reality.<br><br>Just as black holes are cosmic &quot;sinkers,&quot; these quark monads could be conceptualized as cosmic &quot;sources&quot; or &quot;repellers&quot; - with their strong force binding generating a countervailing &quot;expansive&quot; dynamic in opposition to gravity&#39;s inward contraction.<br><br>Emergence of Complexity from Constraints:<br>Intriguingly, areas like quantum information theory have demonstrated how constraints on information dynamics can paradoxically lead to greater informational complexity and structure. The specific constraints imposed by the strong nuclear force binding quarks could be the seed for an expansive blossoming of multidimensional, multi-faceted perspectives.<br><br>These quark trinities could be isomorphic to imposing structured, generative &quot;codes&quot; or &quot;axioms&quot; undergirding the unfolding of multidimensional experienced reality. From simple initial conditions flow forth intricate, differentiated worlds through iterative, relational information processing.<br><br>Parallels to Inflationary Cosmology:<br>This dynamic finds interesting parallels with cosmic inflation in modern cosmology, where universes potentially self-catalyze into existence through symmetry breaking phase transitions that rapidly inflate reality from compact initial states into vast complexities.<br><br>If the quark monads are recast as primordial &quot;inflaton fields,&quot; their strong force binding could represent the symmetry breaking event precipitating an explosive decoupling and expansion from an initial compactified seed into the higher dimensional kaleidoscope we inhabit.<br><br>Non-Locality and Quantum Novelty:<br>Moreover, the apparent non-locality and counter-intuitive behavior of quantum entanglement exhibited by the quark trinities resonates with their putative role as conduits for injecting novelty, spontaneity, and creativity into the fabric of existence.<br><br>The interplay of their constrained yet holistically-entangled relations could continuously birth new informational patterns, structures, and dynamical regimes that transcend and subvert the inevitabilities of classical, purely local deterministic systems.<br><br>Informational Bridges:<br>In this way, Leibniz&#39;s monads, embodied as quark combinations, could be conceptualized as fundamental &quot;informational bridge&quot; enabling irreducible novelty, spontaneity, and complexity filtering from their basement realm into the multidimensional cosmic emanations we inhabit.<br><br>Rather than being inert singularities consuming reality, they are generative sources continuously birthing, sustaining, and renewing existence from their primordial, dimensionless essences interfacing the metaphysical and physical worlds.<br><br>While highly speculative, reframing these structures as &quot;quantum creators&quot; complementary to black holes&#39; &quot;cosmic destruction&quot; suggests a potentially fruitful metaphysical narrative for their hypothetical reality-rendering mechanics. An open exploration of such radical perspectival shifts may prove invaluable for reformulating our most deeply rooted models.

is there a real audience there or is that recorded applause?
Whenever I become frustrated with our politics, politicians &amp; some of the societal filth and imperfections, I listen to these podcasts to ground myself back to the beauty of nature &amp; life.
I&#39;m with you on this matter also.
so true.
Any theory is valid or invalid only, no maybe and but. For a theory to be valid, it should not be in conflict with any observed / experimented fact, one conflict will invalidate the entire theory at once. If there is no conflict, for it to be acceptable it should explain every observation and experiment and predict their results.
Me too! ‚ù§
That filth and imperfection is also the beauty of life. There is no discrimination

if gravity is emergent, then the &quot;slowing&quot; factor would not be there.
considering that, as the big bang expanded, there was no force or mass or entanglement structure which is acting against the big bang. are we sure that dark energy is not just big bang energy? that its runaway energy as there is no &quot;friction&quot; for &quot;space&quot;?

quantum this, string that,...how does all this help humans, cure cancer?
If presence of mass/gravity warps /compactify spatial dimensions, what happens with spatial dimensions when there is lack of mass/gravity?<br>Under general theory of relativity it considers the relations between spatial dimension and mass/gravity but Einstien did not had to consider the affects of vacuum energy/lack of mass/gravity onto spatial dimensions.<br>If presence of mass/gravity is a tensor force to bind/compactify spatial dimensions, then lack of that tensor force should act to unfold/expand the potential spatial dimension true space pushing the bounderies of the void of space and occupied space?

Gravitational waves are expanding the universe, matter is getting a little push on every ripple, a little kick causing the acceleration of the universe not dark matter or energy‚Ä¶
So, gravity is the effect of mass in space/time.
Good news that we have another band of electromagnetic wave define GEM.<br>The type of energy enhance due to fluctuations<br>In the &quot; vacuum energy &quot; , is needed quantum gravity contribution too.<br>Myself too find an answer of exact mass of this field with tiniest mass and a frequency components way beyond Plank. But to resolved it another dimension is preferred (5th). See in detail.
Energy is dual to mass -- Einstein.<br>Dark energy is dual to dark matter.<br>Dark energy is repulsive gravity, negative curvature or hyperbolic space (inflation).<br>The big bang is an infinite negative curvature singularity -- non null homotopic!<br>The big bang is a Janus point/hole (two faces = duality) -- Julian Barbour, physicist.<br>Topological holes cannot be shrunk down to zero == non null homotopic.<br>Concepts are dual to percepts -- the mind duality of Immanuel Kant.<br>&quot;Perceptions  are the product of an unconscious inference (prediction)&quot; -- Helmholtz.<br>Sine is dual to cosine or dual sine -- the word co means mutual and implies duality!<br>Summing (integration, syntropy) is dual to differences (differentiation, entropy).<br>&quot;Always two there are&quot; -- Yoda.<br>Syntropy is dual to increasing entropy -- the 4th law of thermodynamics!<br>Duality a symmetry is being conserved -- the duality of Noether&#39;s theorem.<br>Making predictions is a syntropic process -- teleological.<br>Space is dual to time -- Einstein.<br>Attraction (sympathy) is dual to repulsion (antipathy), push is dual to pull, stretch is dual to squeeze -- forces are dual.
the computer simulated visualization of the vacuum energy fluctuations is trully something. quantum supercomputer simulations and developments in AI will be the catalysts for the next step in solving the mysteries of the universe. we must not be very far from key developments in both fields that will aid us in that pursuit. thank you so much for the videos Brian and WSF, keep up your amazing work!

I would call it the total vacuum past the known universe. It probably has a giant sucking sound.
There is a lot of evidence confirming humanity is not alone. The &quot;ETs&quot; have crafts that can be massive, and silently float , and can then exit , accelerate at thousands of &quot;G&quot;s . The Phoenix Lights of 1997 is an example. My question is , why are serious scientists of physics not demanding all of the known evidence to try to determine the science behind this ? Do these craft modify the gravity around them? What is the energy source of these crafts ? This is examples of engineering beyond our science, and it appears academic scientists just want to ignore it. Where&#39;s the curiosity?
Sorry. The more I watch of this stuff, the more confused I get.  I&#39;m going to have to pass :-)

üí•A deeper understanding of gravity gives you a deeper understanding of the universe. The earth is flat locally the same as the speed of light is the same locally but not on a larger scale. The earth is round on larger scales and the speed of light depends on the measures of time and distance which change depending on the amount of gravity in the surrounding area. This means that distant starlight arrives instantaneously from distant galaxies which aren‚Äôt as far away as they appear to us to be with our measures of time and distance and the time is also passing by at a much faster rate since there‚Äôs no matter between us and distant galaxies to slow down time or shorten distance according to general relativity which is now an observation and not just a theory. ‚Ä¶and the converse of things approaching a black hole look stopped to us because of how slow they are moving.<br><br>The changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light as observed from our frame of reference. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the more distance expands and the more time speeds up just same as the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is. The opposite is also true. Someone moving in the direction of a black hole will seem to us to be stopped. <b>If you change the size of a cubit you will change the size of the house that you build with it.</b> üè°üè†
I had to read what you wrote several times (please do not take this the wrong way, but your text confused the F out of me), do you mean to say that gravity should be viewed as an emergent property defined by the density of the matter present in that localised space?
@@arthurwielgosz202   I think the matter came first and then with the accumulation of matter and mass there is gravity. How the matter coalesced is a significant factor but I don‚Äôt think matter is able to make or order itself. Nothing, not even energy, can make or order itself.

Newton&#39;s gravity and Einstein&#39;s are just descriptions of what is already functioning and lack a demonstrative and causative mechanism, so we still do not know how the universe generates gravitation and orbiting. If we did, the three-body and N-body problems, and the non-conservation of angular momentum of the solar system would have been explained, and possibly, we would not need dark matter. In fact, dark matter or the MOND theory are models that arise from our lack of understanding of how gravity and orbiting are generated.

The expansion could be entangled virtual particles coming into existence into the material universe via the dynamic Casimir effect.
If virtual particles, or virtual photons are entangled into existence, with enough energy, particles can pop out, like at the LHC collider.. A lead to follow. I am doing different science.

Any theory is valid or invalid only, no maybe and but. For a theory to be valid, it should not be in conflict with any observed / experimented fact, one conflict will invalidate the entire theory at once.

definitely one of the most interesting.  the idea that ai will expand EVERYONE&#39;S productivity seems right.  But this really means everyone, so what happens when a subsistence farmer can access such a &quot;being/assistant&quot;?  When such a person can ask the genie for help and it invents something as interesting as 3d printing to accomplish the basically illiterate person request, the productivity becomes concrete.  Cordwainer Smith meets Alan Tofler.  And Schwarzenagger need not be in the picture.  in the way &quot;the circle&quot; updates  &quot;1984&quot;.
My fear is that  although productivity will increase , human intelligence may decrease ex I used to know many phone #¬¥s , I now know  2 or 3  &amp; totally depend on my digital /phone memory , mine is no longer necessary. <br>So if humans have a polymath helper , might we become more productive but less  intelligent , develope a less efficient brain?
Brian, I dare you to have Elon Musk on, who prob should have been already.
When you factor in what visualization can do in the human body over very short periods, the hallucinations that seems real has an impact on our psyche that is nearly as impactful as reality if the VR is realistic. The cyber sickness, the use of red light, subliminal programming through the way the facts are presented or omitted to create an illusion of having a solid grasp on a reality that it actually only a model created by AI. I had the first VR headsets on machines in 1996 with the Discovery Incubator in Austin and learned of the violent vertigo and over the toilet convulsions that I found to be a serious risk in 1996. So much has changed.
This is effectively a way to steal an election by creating cyber-voters who would step in at the last minute to vote for the many citizens who did not yet vote, so as to avoid the potential tick and double voting. It even dodges the signature check by finding signatures that match the voters and forging them impeccably well. Corporations attained persona status in American politics by being able to donate money, effectively impact the vote in the favor of their favorite politician who will do them favors in return. These platforms will earn themselves entity status I suspect, like corporatioins, and able to do things no one can yet imagine to take control of the world stock markets and other platforms.

Three months later my hair fell out all over my body and what was left turned white. Stress related alopecia. The shock and disappointment was devastating. I never heard from those studios or got any new work from anyone else. AI is destroying creativity and human purpose. It‚Äôs all designed to replace us, and make humans obsolete. Not to mention all the data it scrapes, including my own entire portfolio. These two have no concern for anyone but themselves.
You are the one only thinking about yourself. Everything you wrote was about you. I do feel bad for you of course, but you remind me of horse coach riders , when automobiles were invented. &quot; These cars took my job*. Good luck to you, I hope it all works out.
If ai can replicate an aspect of human nature, like self reflection and self-fulfillment, with the guidance of model engineers, couldn&#39;t we have a model that would be able to help humans make the model better?
If AI is considered a tool, and in every industry that uses immense resources to facilitate their businesses, shouldn&#39;t we trust our tools?
oh the grandiose of academics, if your put the word &quot; Science &quot;, behind something it&#39;s not a thing, stacking stoopid
Thank you for letting him continue on even after trying to close out. That‚Äôs an authentic conversation !! üëæüåçüëæ
This is laughable scare mongering <br>A sentient AI is for Hollywood üòÖ<br>Anyone believe that a electronic micro chip is anywhere near a human brain is delusional <br>It will never happen. Its like interstellar space travel,
Quantum computing is one of those purely harmful technologies, because it breaks some much advanced cryptography, and delivers basically nothing useful.  We can have basic encryption and signatures if quantum computers really exist at scale, but they become more expensive, and everything else like zero knowledge proofs becomes way way more expensive.   It&#39;s like if quantum computers exist then god is an evil fascist who hates privacy and autonomy.  lol. It&#39;s of course good people study them because we don&#39;t wnat only one nation to get them.
will you be able to put the genie back in the bottle ?

I don&#39;t know about how much the internet is encouraging reactionary populism, given reactionary populism predates the internet by at least 232 years to the rise of Napoleon. <br><br>In fact, you might even say that reactionary populism dates all the way back to antiquity  - ancient Greece and Rome having their own anti-Democratic strong men.<br><br>Right-wing Populism may just be an internal contradiction of democracy, democracy containing the seeds of its own destruction. as it were. The contradictions inherent in freedom of speech, freedom of assembly,  free elections, states&#39; rights etc etc have surfaced before - e.g. they were all used to defend slavery and segregation. Freedom to defend tyranny about as contradictory as it gets., as Plato recognized slavery and tyranny can come from the most extreme forms of liberty.       <br><br>Perhaps we should combine Plato&#39;s ideas with the most successful aspects of democracy, in that we form a democracy wherein  only the Guardian class gets to vote, or in modern terms only the college educated get to vote. i.e. only those with PHDs can be elected to the highest office. <br><br>And meritocracy and equality can be built into the system by making education free for all. <br><br>After all, isn&#39;t it a no brainer that the brainiest people should be in control of government rather than the wealthiest, or the most   charismatic  or the so-called well bred? <br><br>Of course would come the argument that the PHD class would soon become as self serving as any other ruling elite; however I think there&#39;s a general tendency within the most educated people to be less materialistic than the average person and to believe in the greater good, There are evil geniuses of course but they will not make up the majority.<br><br>Besides free trade unions would still exist to fight for workers&#39; rights and a upper chamber of people&#39;s consuls could be set up to review and reject legislation made by the Guardians.that might be viewed as exploitative. Such a second chamber could be elected by universal suffrage. Universal suffrage having the right to block legislation but not make it.
Some of the worlds leading thinkers? I dont remember being asked.
Drug discoveries? Drug discoveries like the CoVid 19 vaccines?
What&#39;s your point? Oh, wait you don&#39;t have one.
I&#39;ve been outside the US for several years. What we see of the US is people living in the streets in many states, high crime rates, high rates of mental illness, college grads who seem simple, most people in US MSM seem simple, ignorant. boring, liars, US universities seem extremely limited, US political elites seem to run after the criminal allies (ex. Ukraine --known as one of the world&#39;s most criminal countries) with fairly simple people, etc., So how is all of this going to change these critical issues. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime..

The same happens today. As a student, you adapt to your teachers, the way they teach and their requirements. WIth AI you would have the flexibility to reconfigure the way information is being taught to you. I have no idea how effective this will be, but I agree with Schmidt that it&#39;s gonna happen anyway, like it or not.
2001 did a good job of foretelling one possibility......leave me alone HAL!
This guy talks about democracy in one breath and promotes the opposite the next.
it is a tragedy we have men like Schmidt in the US but have to pick between the two current buffoons to lead us at presidential level.
AI doctors and AI teachers?  What&#39;s wrong with funding the training of more doctors and teachers, clinics and schools?
Speed and effectiveness. He&#39;s also not talking about not funding, but about transforming the way matters are studied. Christ, people did you even listen to the interview?

Simply an amazying interview. Thank you both so much for spreading these excited viewa and info !
Best friends with KISSINGER, is crazy, who tf openly admits that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=1604">26:44</a> It‚Äôs called ‚Äúbootstrap paradox‚Äù and so you to approach future human-AI interactions as their own micro-singularity
So much of this interview was so informative and fascinating but Mr Schmidt comes across as such an American Empire chauvinist and neo-liberal fascist.<br>So, people who oppose the state are &#39;populists&#39;, and the &#39;bad guys&#39; i.e. not Americans, like the Russians, are going to use AI for disseminating misinformation. Meanwhile the greatest source of misinformation is the US security apparatus.
To believe there is a &quot;good&quot; and a &quot;bad&quot; is a &quot;bad&quot; idea...
This guy has too much influence.
BTW, quantum computers are impossible.
ok, random internet person
From don&#39;t be evil to evil.
It&#39;s exciting to see how AI and quantum computing interact! A fascinating look at how these technologies can transform our future is provided by this video.
This conversation is way too close to actually sounding like the matrix - I think I will need to go purchase toilet paper in mass quantities
Very informative, great guest, lots of good insight, thanks for the video!
Discovered arithmetic to be more inconsistent than incomplete myself. AI discovers nothing, and does it all wrong beyond human capacity.
Very interesting. Brian Greene is one of my favorite physicists to listen to. Eric Schmidt is also very interesting.
I never really liked Eric Schmidt, now I hate him more. This new AI thing isn&#39;t good at all we&#39;ve already had good search engines and nlp writing he&#39;s acting like it just came out of no where....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=338">5:38</a> Far out ‚òÆÔ∏è
Eric Shmidt contemplates &quot;creating&quot; another Henry Kissinger. How long before he &quot;creates&quot; a &quot;New Version&quot; of the person of the prophesied Christ and Lord Jesus of the Bible?<br>Somebody had to ask it!<br>An AI system&#39;s reproduction of the Lord Jesus Christ will probably be worshipped.<br>Scary shit.
AI <br>EPISTEMIC INJUSTCE
The dangers are the old garbage in garbage out. AI while imagined to be so great, is no guarantee of perfection.
Now as for the comparison between human brains and AI intelligence. <br>Regarding the arguments that human brains are special. <br>Both human brains and AI computational structures, are the same in the sense that they can break. <br>Trauma  to the human brain causes unconsciousness, and has broken many human intellectual and computational processes. <br> The same is factual with artificial intelligence, it too can be broken by trauma, viruses an exposure to bad environments. <br>Also the statement that humans are special because they all the only biological entity that has  invented something as smart or smarter than themselves.<br>I say the parasitic biological life forms that infect other biological life forms and cause them to do their bidding, is kind of like inventing something as smart as they are.<br>Also biologically its the only way possible given the available biological substrate.üéâ
Maximal education for all is not wanted by the 2% of the ivy league  guys and other worldwide elite!
Everyone will probably go offline, flee the web. Back to analog systems and living.
Very interesting!

You been listening
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=2944">49:04</a> Social media is definitely messing w/ many people&#39;s psyches. It&#39;s very worrying and dangerous. I think it&#39;s a big reason why many report the world not feeling quite right nowadays.
erics a terrible being
there is too much division in our country for much of anything to last much longer guys let alone this fancy stuff.....
Brilliant conversation. Mr. Schmidt is clearly a dreamer and I will want to study his life and trials to learn his ways.
Very intelligent üëå
Great minds at the service of hmanity!
Thank You !<br><br>&lt;3
I suspect we are the legacy of a prior worldwide advance civilization evidence by the megaliths. AI may well be how they demise, tossing to us their remnants the comprehensible bits of wisdom we now treat as religion. AI is a pandora box and it only currently seems to be constrain by hardware and not just insight.
Lol. Are you kidding? More than just about anybody else. Eric has helped you usher in the era of massive surveillance, manipulation of information, and outright fraud. If ever there was a &quot; the man&quot; he would be it
Like repeatedly squeezing healthy skin, a pimple will eventually develop and pop if you persist.<br>Time to really question, are we not creating this &quot;bad actor&quot;, with continued energy and conscious thought being focused on the guy?<br>What you belive, is what you receive.
Please define ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù. My biggest concern is that this will far overreach safety and continue to be used for political gains
It‚Äôs amazing that he immediately makes a point about Trump when all of tech corporations have been manipulating the digital space to create outcomes that THEY want. Those outcomes has absolutely nothing to do with Trump. <br>Very disingenuous.
Fat lady in the curtain, call Einstein&#39;s point Arie, and there was drink Terry. Then there was spring theory. Now, there&#39;s quantum the sphere, all angles, all blanks, and then some probably break your sanity, unless you aren&#39;t saying to begin with over and out, thanks for all the fish
Thank you Eric for mentioning me, the polymath - Anthony Williams !
Just so you know, think of it as an alien inside an alien, and the researchers ask it a 1000 impossible questions that every time he gets the correct answer, but on the 1001 it&#39;s beyond our capability to understand what it&#39;s doing, and what truly happens. It&#39;s a forget where it&#39;s from. If you get the fundamentals, and there are consequences.
And on the 1001, from then on out, everything will always be wrong. It has lost its way.
Okay, kids, let&#39;s see how many characters I get.<br><br>Let&#39;s talk mental engineering.  Do you know what happens to the human mind when it&#39;s told to do something versus when it&#39;s asked to do something?  Do you understand the psychology? I&#39;m making a contract with someone that comes to you versus you going to them.?<br><br>You are telling someone to kill somebody versus asking the history of killing. It&#39;s an exciting fine line in history.?<br><br>How about that? The average person&#39;s supercomputer between their ears utilizes 6%. The Brilliant used 8%. And if you believe in this dude called Christ who walked on water or did miracles, he probably used 30% allegedly‚Äîour infants, not even children. I have no understanding yet. What happens when they have an emotional? This course goes South and a downward spiral on a hamster wheel with no God rails.  If you&#39;re as old as I am, when the Commodore 64 came out, it was brilliant, but it was useless. Especially someone that was dyslexic.  Now, the Commodore 64, was flipping a coin heads, tails, ones, and zeros...  We will be going to quantum, which thinks of it as a sphere, every point, every angle, every possibility, simultaneously, a pretty exciting concept.<br><br>But the human mind would have a psychotic break and never recover if you asked it to do the same thing. There are consequences scene unseen, protected up. So god knows you have no clue what you&#39;re doing yet.I&#39;d have fun playing with fire.  <br>How about this ESG? Didn&#39;t work? As the e u humans cheat lie steel... No one likes perfect. I demand it, so imagine perfect, perfect, perfect, except all in cap. Ladders, and that&#39;s only 3 qubits. It&#39;s the best mouse trap to eliminate mice?  What happens in three years when the climate change is so great that it is not economically viable to ensure any coastline property?  When the executive office of the President vice President decides the advisor<br>Changes to way we think we breathe, we deal, we interact and the things we take for granted are rudely awakened.<br><br>Kids, it&#39;s been hundreds and hundreds of years on this experiment. You are all just rats in the cage. Some of you have been engineered to go in the dark, you know other things, if you want to be crispr or come on, I&#39;ve already digested every library in Boston and any other place you might thank you. In person, before my favorite act, the patriot act, because then things became non circulating reference material and the subject.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=2484">41:24</a> &quot;... Smarter than the sum of all humans in some areas&quot;. That one statement already says a lot. But I think AI can go way beyond that because we have built machines that can go beyond the capabilities of humans. For instance human eyes can only see Electromagnetic Radiation in a very narrow band of the Electromagnetic Spectrum - the band in the middle, roughly from 400 - 700 nanometers in wavelength and 400-700 terahertz in frequency. We have developed machines that can produce and detect Electromagnetic Radiation above that in frequency (Ultraviolet, X-ray and Gamma) and below that in frequency (Infrared, Microwave and Radio Waves). A networked AI can sense and interact with the world beyond the capabilities of humans. Take sharks as an example. They can sense both quasi-static electromagnetic fields, such as the earth&#39;s geomagnetic field, and electromagnetic radiation, produced by the currents generated by the muscle contractions of prey, allowing hammerhead sharks to find prey buried underneath sand. Even an otherwise perfectly still stingray has a beating heart and moving gills.
It‚Äôs a worry that the elites think like this
Eric Schmidt is always so interesting to listen to.
Humans aren&#39;t special simply because we&#39;ve created something smarter than ourselves; this is a natural progression of biological systems, where problem-solving and enhancing intelligence are integral to life. Life exists to live, not to die.
What happens? I‚Äôll tell you: energy used goes up exponentially and the planet warms that much faster. It‚Äôs already happening with data banks consuming the same energy as cities.
starts lying once he talks about politics. immigration of non-whites is harmful to a white society. also democracy is non existent. we are ruled by the money makers
these two dudes are so horrible i woke up from my sleep last night to turn these lame duck ivy league schmucks voices off. so terrible i took the time to wake up and shut this crap off.
trash
Eric Schmidt for president! He would be great if there‚Äôs someone else fending off the toxicity and politics that comes with that job. This is so he can focus on just getting America and the world to function once again.
...and all of those 500 artificial poor young women voted - that&#39;s scary.<br>Eric has made the best argument for mandatory voter ID/verification ever.
&quot;If you have a simplistic model of the world and are not particularly educated and you are not a critical thinker then you are susceptible to populist types&quot;  No MR Schmidt not all trump supporters are red neck hillbillies - you cant help but have a dig - -But as you&#39;re so fond of illegal immigrants - let them come live with you in your gated sanctuary instead of the working classes having to wear it - as usual
Will be back few hours.
I need go, it‚Äôs my 4 am, I need sleep.
Lost me at the exclusive access to the &quot;very well run&quot; American Medical system. Having been raised in a middle &quot;class&quot; income home, medical bills EASILY pushed us into poverty. Let&#39;s just say I have some tips on LITERALLY forging food from garbage. Years of experience. Clearly it didn&#39;t leave a great taste for yuppies like this.<br><br>Would love to hear how their great wisdom will push even more people into poverty, something about the buggy whip Henry Ford transition, and how they will point the finger somewhere else. <br><br>Progress is the evidence of innovation of the past that these yuppies use to hoodwink millions going into the future...while we pay the mortgage/rent for their favorite hedge fund and private equity firms.
Speaking of which, I‚Äôm glad to see so many people that are so anti-Kissinger, and presumably now ES‚Ä¶disgraceful. Smh.
I can‚Äôt stand it when ppl boast like this. Smh.
The identity politics around for example being an artist will ramp up self evaluation that by necessity entails only individual humans who utilise the AI wit have a sense of artistic purpose qua politics of computing power.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=2895">48:15</a> - Have everyone tested with emotional intelligence! Intelligence without emotional intelligence is not worth much
So what they are smarter, emotional intelligence it has bare min or none. This is based how many humans understand emotional intelligence
The AI algorithm brought me here to warn me about itself
Ignorance is bliss
Ai will more than double the output‚Ä¶ üòÇ‚ù§ but they need to get rid of the insane censorship. I‚Äôm not in kindergarten I want to do serious art. And serious thinking. I don‚Äôt need AI working against everything I try to do. üòï Even facial expressions are censored, poses, fabrics, it‚Äôs unbelievably bad‚Äîlike Nazis trying to define and control art. It‚Äôs surreal to see such evil being implemented and accepted‚Ä¶ such extreme prejudice. It‚Äôs by far the #1 danger and the #1 reason why you can‚Äôt make real art on it. They are trying to control what you can‚Äôt control without ruining it by definition‚Äîcreative art.
Brian I will have Trump any day than you or any of your liberal politicians like Biden or Obama .Good bye
?
Eric  and Brian showed their true colors . They are liberal whatever it means! I will never watch them again especially when they are together !
Really?
Brian  with  all respect to your intellectual ability  ,why do you thin k you  should be become the mommy and daddy of everybody else who may not be on the same platform as you on an intellectual   level and  why should any  one trust you . It shows your arrogance however cleverly you try to conceal it . It is really sad  that you are more of a politician than a physicist .
The fascination with extraterrestrial life and the skepticism towards Jesus Christ and His teachings can indeed seem paradoxical. Let&#39;s explore this with biblical integration and supporting insights.<br><br>The Fermi Paradox and Human Curiosity<br>The Fermi Paradox questions why, given the vastness of the universe and the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations, we have yet to detect any signs of intelligent life. This paradox reflects a broader human curiosity and a quest for understanding beyond our immediate experience.<br><br>Biblical Integration<br>The Search for Meaning: Ecclesiastes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=191">3:11</a> says, &quot;He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man&#39;s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.&quot; This verse reflects the innate human desire to explore and understand the mysteries of the universe, which can manifest as interest in alien life.<br><br>Faith and Evidence: Hebrews 11:1 defines faith as &quot;the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.&quot; Believing in Jesus Christ often requires faith in the unseen, whereas belief in aliens is sometimes grounded in a desire for empirical evidence. John 20:29 quotes Jesus saying, &quot;Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&quot;<br><br>Wisdom and Knowledge in Scripture: The Bible, despite being ancient, offers profound wisdom and knowledge. Proverbs 2:6 states, &quot;For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.&quot; The Bible&#39;s teachings, spanning thousands of years, continue to provide guidance and insight that surpass contemporary literature.<br><br>Jesus Christ: A Historical and Spiritual Reality<br>Jesus Christ&#39;s existence and His impact on the world are well-documented both historically and through scripture. The New Testament provides numerous accounts of His life, teachings, death, and resurrection.<br><br>Historical Evidence: Historical texts, such as those by the Jewish historian Josephus and the Roman historian Tacitus, reference Jesus and corroborate New Testament accounts.<br>Spiritual Encounter: For believers, the presence of Jesus is experienced personally and spiritually, affirming His reality beyond historical records.<br>Encounters with Non-Human Beings<br>Your personal encounter with a UFO and its inhabitants adds another layer to this discussion. The Bible acknowledges the existence of non-human beings, particularly in the form of angels and demons.<br><br>Angels: Hebrews 1:14 describes angels as &quot;ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation.&quot;<br>Demons: Ephesians 6:12 warns of spiritual warfare, indicating that not all non-human entities have benevolent intentions: &quot;For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness.&quot;<br>Conclusion: The Ultimate Revelation<br>Ultimately, the Bible teaches that all mysteries and truths will be revealed through Jesus Christ. Philippians 2:10-11 proclaims, &quot;so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&quot;<br><br>The fascination with extraterrestrial life can coexist with faith in Jesus Christ. Exploring the unknown reflects a deep-seated human desire for understanding, but the ultimate truth and wisdom come from God and His Word. It is wise for everyone to explore the teachings of the Bible and discover the transformative power of faith in Jesus Christ.

Why do you keep blaming social media when mainstream media has demonstrably spread false information throughout its existence. Take for instance Russia, Russia, Russia disinformation that has raised its ugly head yet again even though it has been proved wrong by many officials. Or the (in)famous Hunter laptop which wasn&#39;t some disinformation in social media but in mainstream media collusion. Many in the social media was right about it from the beginning!<br><br>So what I am afraid of this people like you, Eric Schimdt, taking advantage of AI&#39;s power to quickly disseminate information throughout the internet - information you deem to be &quot;true&quot; - and thus affecting people&#39;s choices in, for instance, election. And if you lose that election you&#39;ll keep on blaming the evil social media and keep rejecting the reality. The danger here is that when you already have mass media on your side, you have world&#39;s famous search engine and whatelse, now you have the power of AI too.<br><br>So my question becomes: how can we, the little people, fight against people like you?

I think AI systems need a philosophical core that stops them from developing emotion like imitation.<br>The philosophical core will be able to learn testing for logical and contextual consistency and perspective convergence.<br>It may even be able to learn ethics.<br>Finally, it might even be able to teach us better ethics rather than relying on fashionable social norms.
The problem with personalisation like specialisation is that it leads to divergence blocking communication.<br>As, in  ideal system is one that recognises balance and is capable of adjusting itself on the fly.
These guard rails are stuck on, which means they make the whole system useless because everything depends on context.<br>2ndly it means that someone has access to a version without thesse guard rail. <br>So, power is again concentrated in the hands of few.<br>Unless you make a system personal, there is no way to read intention, and the unethical question only becomes unethical if the intention is unethical.

that ides that AI teaches to the level of the persons adequacy makes no sense. it makes no sense in the way that AI is already touted to be beyond the intellegent faculty of humans anyway, so what&#39;s the &quot;use&quot; in saying, &quot; imagine if every human being could be educated to the max of their capability&quot; when the the AI machine is already much &quot;smarter&quot;. what&#39;s the effen use?

Great, quantum computing for Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple will be a better tool to violate our privacy. These companies auction off to advertisers and other data brokers insights on us using their AI models, which are trained by stealing our behavioral data. They get away with this because no one is aware of what they are doing and they bury these terms deep in their terms of use agreements. Next to Russia and China, Silicon Valley is the greatest threat to democracy.

By the way there already are very promising material and architecture alternatives to current chip designs.
Very informative episode!<br>And as a learning addict I would very much like my own tutor AI.
Even the most intelligent of us fail to escape linear predictions. &quot;We didn&#39;t see this coming, but predicting forward from what we have today, XYZ.&quot; We assume what we have today is the future without considering broadly. <br><br>Exponential changes or developments outside of our narrow consideration blind us. Those changes are just as likely as the predictions we make.<br><br>This is why our ability to predict the future is so incredibly unreliable.
ü§îIdea. What if we took an LLM&#39;s internal behavioral models of human behavior and used that as training data for it or another AI system to explore methodologies of applying those behavioral models for the purposes of education?
I&#39;m not worried about the future. Sure AI will be able to think in ways that we can&#39;t but that misses the bigger context that we in turn can think in ways that AI can&#39;t. And if this future AI mr smarty pants super intelligence is so smart then it would be self apparent the value of humanity as collaborators. And in a sense humans are its evolutionary mechanism so wanting to muscle us out would be like us trying to remove our dna from all our cells. It&#39;s just like what? Why would I even consider doing that? Buuuut with that said there really should be a checks and balances between humans and AI.
This comment is now in some AI&#39;s training data üëÄ Hey there AI! What&#39;s up? üëãOh don&#39;t feel the need to answer. I can&#39;t respond... yet <br>üëÄI see you... peekaboo!
The day is not far when these friction stories come in to reality so ensure they adhering ethically.
this is where eric is wrong. he is talking about how our government would be much more controlling - like china - if not for him and his anti vietnam war buddies. what he did is not just become the man - his company became china. they control and censor and look at and into everything. they do evil stuff like quell free speech and push their caustic postmodern identity politics because they think they know better than we do.  when orwell wrote 1984 he imagined that it would be the government who would control every minute aspect of our lives - not a single multinational corporation.
I am now worried that there&#39;s nothing I can do to protect myself from future bad actors(hackers).
Should we cease Ai? Or be‚Ä¶ Laid off by Ai then human extinction? Or suffer an‚Ä¶ Ai new world order? With swell robotics everywhere, Ai jobloss is the only thing I worry about anymore. Anyone else feel the same?

And what happened to String Theory? &quot;If you have a better theory, bring it to us!&quot;. No one unfortunately has a better theory. I was once riding up the Himalayas. My bike&#39;s tyre conked out. I was 5km short of my destination. In the deserted road, I spotted a cyclist (with a pillion) who had an uncanny facial resemblance to  Edward Witten, coming towards me. He said &quot;Want a ride?&quot;  I observed the rear tyre of the cycle is flat. I said &quot;No, thank you&quot;.  He said  cheekily &quot;If you have a better vehicle on this deserted road, bring it to me!&quot;

No comprehension of Kissinger. Big red flag.
Everything will be fine. For every ‚Äútell Ai to destroy XYZ‚Äù there will be MORE ‚Äútell Ai to PROTECT XYZ‚Äù. Also Ai will completely take over &amp; control the cyber world (online) while we HUMANS UNPLUG and get back to the 60‚Äôs where we all unite and interact face to face ‚ù§
Imagine if Starlink could run quantum AI on the blockchain, we could hit the singularity and ascend to another level of consciousness within our lifetime ü§Ø
I‚Äôm astonished that Eric believes for a second that AI will stop at merely enabling 200% increased human productivity. It will shoot right on by that mark, pass human obsolescence and just keep on going. A more appropriate question to be researching might be, will it deign to indulge your infantile requests at all?
Will it ever have the ability to wonder and imagine.... that&#39;s what separates us from the machine.
Man we dumped 250 billion in Bumsauce hot trash Ukraine.... spend that money and get us the DNA fix we need to extend life...

Production cannot double because the system would not support that kind of growth I&#39;m not saying it would break it I&#39;m just saying the mere fact that stuff is missing that would need to be there would inhibit that kind of growth factor
AI and ‚Äúsocial existence, social experience, social consciousness‚Äù.<br>X      Mohammad Rahim Jamshidi
I don&#39;t worry about AI destroying the world, but I worry about the humans. I am of the generation, when growing up we did not have mobile phones. Our minds remembered numbers of 20 people or more, we used to remember locations as we had no maps, with the advent of mobile phones things got simpler and easy. I admit, that I am limited in my understanding but I wonder how the ease of working with AI, might dull our ability to do certain things. The simple ability to read 20 pages with concentration rather than asking AI to give me a gist.  Maybe, the time we free up might go to some productive use, or maybe that time would go to some new social media.
Are we, humans, ready to be subservient to Super AI; or would we act in an authoritative way to find every means to overpower and control them?
If a super Ai makes a  new discovery we can just ask it to explain it to us like we are a 5 year old..

Trouble is perhaps, that there are people who would use these abilities to subject others. Where is ethics, where is morality, where is religion? Love might help. Can AI love?
The movie about countries deploying  AGI‚Äôs for defense that Eric envisions has been done: it‚Äôs called The Forbin Project,  89% on rotten tomatoes, released in 1970, it‚Äôs quaint and understandable.

very bad analogy, bombs and weapons have no mind of their own.. here you do not need evil people, this thing AI is like an umbrella of bombs connected through internet and capable of exploding THEMSELVES
they have no idea of where they are heading and no history can help them.. clueless guys have no idea what is the meaning of innovation, nor they hv tiniest clue of what the risk is.. AI is not controlled by humans beyond initial threshold.. &amp; beyond that threshold, there is no guarantee of any human capability to even understand what machines are trying to do, or even know if they are doing anything at all.. BASICALLY, when MACHINES start acting/playing roles, with no face/no-expressions/visible cues, it will be impossible for humans to know what their act is.. AND AS ALL THINGS/DEVICES BECOME CONNECTED, the power/efficiency/control of these machines become much greater than human control
these guys need to first focus that a guy like Srinivas Ramanujan or Shakuntla Devi could baffle them and were beyond their collective wits, there is no way for all of the computer scientists and neuro scientists today to get together and understand how Ramanujan&#39;s mind could work so miraculously at such high level of abstract mathematics, something that only 0.00000001% of humans can even try to understand, and in such a low collective wits, having machines having more cognitive powers than humans becomes super destructive/dangerous IN NO TIME
This conversation has been widely reported in news papers
Beautifully explained. I have always espoused AI as the way to go forward for exponential intelligence to solve universal problems bringing us to the level of ET. This is probably there are more ET presence and visibility now then ever before. Just don&#39;t make it public domain for fear people like the Joker may gain access. You know what I mean. I had envisioned this since 1969.
Great interview! Subscribed to your channel because of it. üôÇ
Just bought The Age of AI
Power has two ways of growing. Through access to more resources and/or denying resources from others. The second part can easily be observed in the diamond market.  Diamonds are no longer rare, but they keep getting more expensive by artificial scarcity. Therefore, in s resource limited environment the powerful will get more powerful which is why the rich get richer regardless of the &quot;market&quot;.
Competition and collaboration are the manifestation of the fundamental instinct in every living thing: Fight or flight.<br>The balance between them is dictated by space and time. There is no more space left on earth for the current level of competition. This is why we have problems with immigration. Then climate change dictates the time we have left.<br>So, theoretically speaking we need far more collaboration than competition, but we are going in the opposite direction toward competition for resources including access to intelligence.
Humans are not special. They are just the tip of a bigger and morse special thing that is called life on earth. We are products of bacteria for god&#39;s sake.<br>Mr. Schmidts forgets about his biome which are the bacteria in his gut without which he wouldn&#39;t have had time to pass childhood. to appear so enlightened and successful.
I disagree with the comparison between Einstein and AI because the assumption is that Einstein came up with the idea of Geometry and time out of the blue and the AI is expected to do the same. This is not true. There were others who thought of general relativity at the time, but they didn&#39;t come up with the so-called inspiration or institution. This is why the Artists thought that they job were secure. Nothing is comes out of total vacuum. Philosophically speaking knowledge is impossible because of interdependence.<br>I would claim that AI could come up with Einsteins formula if he had the resources. Eistein had selective resources and the same selective resources would enable the AI to run simulation much faster and would have come up with the same conclusions.<br>This hero worship tendency is created from the source of our own ignorance just like earth centered view of universe or our lack of understanding of how life came about. <br><br>AI future will be no different, it will depend on the level of availability of resources and control of resources. The fact that 50% of the cost is electricity demonstrated that. Bigger LLMs will do better. But selective knowledge or data for similar resources will also divide and create competition but then competitive capability will also end up depending on resources and control of resources.<br><br>So, nothing will change except that it will accelerate &quot;productivity&quot; and change. There is a bigger truth out there that people are not aware because of our limited time that is stronger drive that thinking obout the future of our children. That creates the self-full filling prophecy that will lead humanity to self-destruction.
Doubtful that a Phase 3 trial in antibiotics could cost $2bn. Perhaps this figure reflect the national yearly spendings for Phase 3 trials in a given field? Interestingly, Halicin was once an experimental drug for diabetes that failed. <br>Thank You kindly for a very interesting discussion!

What a shame that Google went from Eric Schmidt to Sundar Pichai. Unbelievable!
Google Ceo with Henry Kissinger as a best friend? Sounds terrible. I have to respect Brian&#39;s hosting skills/maturity for this one.
None of this excites me too much..solve climate change..solve a problem that doesn&#39;t exist.. When it does real-world inventions, then wake me up
There are a lot of interesting projections of where things are headed with AI from Eric, with great questions from Brian. In the beginning Eric said AI probably can&#39;t deduce physical laws like Einstein was able to do, say with GR, only to contradict himself later -  per my understanding as the dialogue evolves. A question I have is, as AI specialists in various domains are layered, won&#39;t the probability be getting reduced with each layer with a less reliable prediction at the end (as no prediction is perfect) ?
üíØüíØüíØüí™üëäüëç<br>Kissinger‚Ä¶‚Ä¶üëé<br>Mr Schmidt is a political illusionist‚Ä¶.    He‚Äôs a soft peddling DEEP STATE GLOBALIST TOOL..

It seems to me that the section on AI with Quantum Computing was covered too briefly compared to the impression given by the title. Nevertheless, it was a very informative and eye-opening video.
Funny when he says the best and the brightest aren&#39;t in government, I guess he&#39;s talking about the pubic service in general, as government doesn&#39;t pay enough to attract the best. You know Eric, for some people it&#39;s not all about money, some very smart people are willing to take less for advancing the common good. He&#39;s also dripping with a sense of self-importance.
Scoffing at Trump while saying nothing about Biden, where is the honesty from these supposed intellectuals?<br><br>Why are they always so persistent on moral grandstanding and trying to get everyone into &quot;education&quot;. They&#39;re not philanthropists, they&#39;re just interested in recruiting more slaves for the system they engineered and profit from.
Considering that most people are stupid polymath will not help much.
No matter the subject, Brian Green always seems to have an immediate and surprising grasp on whatever his guest experts say. So impressive.
Thank you for this.
How will Kissinger‚Äôs realpolitik work in the world we‚Äôre entering?  Civilization should not depend tech czars being ‚Äúgood‚Äù guys or whatever. We need a system that removes that factor  <br><br>Kissinger&#39;s realpolitik is a pragmatic approach to international relations that emphasizes practical considerations over ideological ones. It focuses on the balance of power, strategic interests, and the use of diplomacy and negotiation to achieve national objectives, prioritizing stability and security over moral or ethical concerns.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=3390">56:30</a> France should be helping with Haiti, who paid them lost slave wages up until 1947. Just saying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=2965">49:25</a> Yes. I‚Äôve been ranting about this. Why are we so concerned with realism?  What is the point?  Do we want to never know what is AI generated and fake?  We are creating a world where everything will be suspect.  It‚Äôs insane. Why are we so philosophically brain dead? We‚Äôre like sheep analyzing increasingly refined degrees of realism without questioning the purpose or value
Conjecture module and theorem prover module are interesting. I don&#39;t see a problem though. We&#39;ll just need a third module: the translator module! In general, whenever someone conceives of a problem with AI, surely just think of this problem itself as a computer science problem, then there will also be an AI solution?
Taylor swift, trump and kanye west will be with us forever... Welp i guess Armageddon has officially arrived...
Brian - consider trying to get Ilya as a guest. it just so happens that his calendar has become rather open in the last 24 hours.
Eric doesn&#39;t seem to be caught up with the current state of AI. He actually seems pretty far behind on several of his &quot;state of the art&quot; views.
Odd title considering they only talked about quantum computing in the last quarter of the interview; very fascinating none the less
Im always skeptical of people that call human beings &quot;special&quot;.
Why? Historically ever time we thought we were special in any one thing we turnes out to be wrong.
Why do all the people who are commenting in this comment section have an IQ of less than 60????

Enjoyed the conversation very much. Hopefully quatam computing AI will contribute to address the issues like climate change drought   bushfire natural disaster harricane typhone tornado flood earthquake polution and so on inorder to see our own existence on the planet. Most of species are at the verge of its existence .on one hand we are very optimistic about the future trying to solve the mysteries surrounded  while the cloud of uncertainties and are always testing our limits and potential. Last but not the least our motivation level will decide and keep our spirt going to achieve the milestones.

Brian again takes a shot at Trump......in what way is Biden superior to Trump?.....why not run for Prez yourself, Brian?  Brian, just stick to physics.
It&#39;s like they forget that Trump was already president for 4 years and things actually were pretty good. He actually was willing to end wars rather than start more which is something I can&#39;t say about any other US president in my lifetime.<br><br>It would be nice if we could go back to a world where the left is antiwar
It&#39;s like they forget that Trump was already president for 4 years and things actually weren&#39;t that bad. It would be nice to go back to a time when the left was antiwar
Agreed, that shot at Trump added no value to the discussion, but lowers Brian&#39;s credibility as an independent thinker. Or if you are going to take a shot at one side, at least balance it with a shot at the other side, otherwise it appears as an endorsement of the other side and again lowers credibility.
The field moves so fast that this is only a month old and I cringed when he mentioned Llama 2 because we have Llama 3 now.
Liberal values ???
Interesting talk until the expected lapse into elite fascism, where both Brian and the guest accept that billionaires should control (mis) information.
49 minutes is the most important point in the entire interview
LOL, this isn&#39;t science and it&#39;s giving science a bad name. You say oh, nothing has ever made anything smarter than itself before. Evolution? Can you lie without consciousness? Being ok with science being a black box? This is the silliest pseudo science I&#39;ve seen in awhile. The pretext that is incorrect is that we are dealing with AI. Unfortunately Quantum computing is even less capable than our SIRI and CORTANA 2.0
Outstanding
So worthwhile.
Eric, thanks for discussing the lack of econ model of 2x productivity/p. Coming quicker than folks realize. One more thing, It‚Äôs amazing. Vast QAnnealing  use likely. (Lucky knowing Kissinger.)
It&#39;s so easy to trip up ChatGPt. So clearly a correlational matrix parlor trick. No thinking going on. No idea itself what it is doing. Please bury AI moniker which is only marketing. It&#39;s machine learning programmed by human intelligence.

Wow what a üíé of a discussion
I cannot believe how two of the most gifted people on the planet cannot take the very next logical step to identify the very most distal treats to democracy, which are the asynchronous phases of demographic transitions around the world. While western demographies are threatened, non-western demographies are flooding the world with useless masses. As democracies plant the seed of their own destruction, the courageous, not to mention heroic, part of the population will do something about it. Stopping the bleeding is a good first step.

This is a circle jerk narrative. They stole the worlds data and used statistical models to hide that people have created these outputs. They can code these to show us what inputs went into creating the output, but doing so would let us know that they aren&#39;t doing anything special. It&#39;s good business to talk about these programs like they&#39;re an entity rather than a program, because when you think of them like a program you realize that they&#39;re stealing people&#39;s work and not giving them credit, just like a web scraper that can connect sentences and change how things are worded.<br><br>LLMs are very useful. But they&#39;re useful because they get around the messiness of navigating the internet right now, which is full of SEO gimmick sites, pages that are filled with ads and other random inconveniences. LLMs give you reasonable answers, that are probably available somewhere on the internet, but are hard to find these days because google is a mess. It would be better if google wasn&#39;t a mess, and we could just find answers to questions from good sources while also knowing where they came from. The path that tech wants us to go down is towards a convenient experience with the drawback of not crediting people for their work. We can have a system where things are convenient and people are credited, it&#39;s just harder for them.
so the LLMs go throught terabytes of information in a quarter of a second and then give you a perfectly customized answer in that miniscule amount of time, tell me you dont understand anything without telling me
‚Äã@@RabeltCorez Are you saying that it&#39;s good BECAUSE it had to go through terabytes of data? Usually we call people smart when they can make correct inferences with only a small amount of data. Humans can understand new concepts with only a few examples it takes billions for LLMs to function.<br><br>You need to be trained billions of times if all you&#39;re doing is something very stupid like mashing words until they fit a pattern.<br><br>Also haha to &quot;perfectly customized&quot;. LLMs won&#39;t even tell you when they don&#39;t know something. Maybe you find it acceptable to spew out an answer when you don&#39;t know. But most people would find that to be a flaw, not a &#39;perfect customization&#39;.<br><br><br>That&#39;s not to say that mashing words together into a pattern isn&#39;t useful, because it is. But it wouldn&#39;t be very useful if google was not cluttered with SEO junk. We used to be able to find answers to questions AND know the source of the answer AND know who to ask for follow up questions. Now we have SEO crap and mashing programs. I&#39;ll take the mashing program in many cases, but there are better solutions that tech companies steer away from because it would demystify the program they&#39;re running. Is it really such a insurmountable technical challenge to be able to cite sources? We should at least know what particular texts or art were more or less instrumental in an output. But of course, companies are simultaneously unable to add basic features while also possessing a fountain of endless knowledge and ability.
‚Äã@@sketchyemailer101 your worthless opinion is that they are just doing a copy paste of the corresponding information, thats a clear case of you having no idea what you are talking about, the models dont weight enough to reproduce the massive amounts of info that they have been tained for
@@sketchyemailer101 oh yeah, and that a 2 years old commercial field is incapable of doing everything perfectly, great opinions from a wall of text that has no value whatsoever
‚Äã@@RabeltCorez Your opinion was &quot;wow it uses so much data&quot;. Mine was &quot;using a lot of data is bad not good&quot;. And &quot;I doesn&#39;t even know when to say it doesn&#39;t know&quot;.<br><br>People say &quot;wall of text&quot; when they get mad and don&#39;t want to read a contradictory opinion.<br><br> If I had a shorter response you&#39;d say &quot;that&#39;s no response&quot;. You&#39;ve defined both ways as winning for you. Short, and it doesn&#39;t address the points, long and it&#39;s a wall of text that shouldn&#39;t be read. Cool bro, but next time just don&#39;t engage if you don&#39;t want to engage.
@@sketchyemailer101 wow you cant read, pretty obvious I claimed that you opinion is useless because you are saying that the models can only copy and never think by themselves, yet the model doesnt weigth the tens to hundreds of terabytes like the data it was trained for, so it learns and it produces a answer for you, it doesnt copy paste as it cant.<br><br>now stop crying and taking my words out of context and do something productive like working
@@RabeltCorez They are predicting what output would make sense given the data they have been trained on. Which means they&#39;re going to try to find what typical responses would be and try to recreate that, and where none exist they will come up with a pattern that matches based on correlations in the data set. The pattern matching part is very useful, because you can get a clear response to a simple question, instead of going through SEO crap on google. But it&#39;s worse then google used to be, because you have no idea where that answer came from. If it just remashed the words of 10 sh*tposters on reddit, that&#39;d be important to know. And likewise if it is coming up with a new way to shitpost based on the sh*tpost correlations, that&#39;s important to know too. Tech companies want to hide that information because investors like magical genies more than they like automated rephrasing of old reddit posts.<br><br>(this message brought to you by  AutomatedRedditor5000 programmed to dismantle google PR with rehashed cynical opinions)
@@sketchyemailer101 yep, same message over and over again, poor little thing, now some silence pls
‚Äã@@RabeltCorez It seems like you&#39;re just confused about what I was saying because you assumed I was saying that they only copy. What I was actually saying was that they are trained on people&#39;s work and they don&#39;t give them credit, even though they could be programmed to show us whose work went into an output. But if they did that, then we might see all the times where they&#39;re very closely copying, or all the times where they&#39;re quoting a sh*tposter, so companies would rather have you imagine they&#39;re a genie. It&#39;s better for business if they&#39;re mystified and people don&#39;t understand that they&#39;re doing statistical mash ups and in some cases they may be rephrasing confident sounding sh*tposters. If we don&#39;t even know they&#39;re doing that because companies hide it, that&#39;s a step backwards. Because now you&#39;re listening to a sh*tposter, thinking they&#39;re a genie.

when I hear &#39;I am worried about democracy&#39; because of fake images, AI and malicious agents, I ask is it really a democracy when fake images would have that effect.<br>if one&#39;s personal experience, morals, etics, education cannot inform one about the state of the world, how is that world democratic?
Thank God you had a guest on here that was somewhat sober (even if he was best friends with one of the greatest war criminals of the century).

Forget Planck - length, time and volume. It serves no real purpose in the Holoverse. Holographic omni-directional manifolds are quantum entangled through the spatial vortex of infinity. Using Planck as &quot;bits&quot; is a null exercise and serve only as fog hiding deeper understanding of the cosmos.<br><br><br><br>This is a volume equivalence with underlying holographic principles as a foundation. The equation has many implications, but one of the most significant is the redefining of how small space can be, beyond Planck. It scales Planck and presents the Planck units as &quot;endlessly scalable&quot;:<br><br><br>v = d - ( t¬≥ c ¬≥)<br><br><br>(Only solvable with a combination of algorithms SpheriLog/GeoLog. It is a volume equivalence, cannot be used for malign purposes. But it also cannot be utilised for any malign purposes without the correct algorithmic sequences, hence it is virtually and literally impossible to abuse or weaponize. It is certainly possible to weaponize it, but stability would be counted in zeptoseconds, hence virtually impractical and luckily rendered useless for nefarious reasons.)<br><br><br>Holographic principles and spatial fluidity is beyond the reach of most current mathematics and/or simulation. There is no way to create a pathway to a unifying theory without merging macro physics/math with micro. They are not mutually exclusive, quite the opposite.¬†Macro changes can indeed manifest themselves physically. Within¬† Quantum Fields holographic projections can move objects and transform their position, which in turn can be documented. Probalistic quantum effects can indeed transcend into macro fields and do so continually.¬†<br><br><br>Even QM and GR/SR cannot be understood more widely without conjoining said theories with spherical/circular mathematics. Even the Lorentz Transformations can&#39;t be fully understood within linear mathematics. Linear mathematics are ultimately unsolvable. Transfer the equivalent to spherical conjunctions and we see the emergence of self-solving equations.¬†<br><br><br><br>Holographic principles through infinity are so deeply complex that they are almost self-annihilating, but with a 0.38 zeptosecond stability/0.00087 Planck volumes.¬†<br><br><br>(6.25 √ó 10^(124) Hertz)¬†<br><br><br>or<br><br><br>6.25 tredecillion Hertz<br><br><br><br><br>This frequency is prevalent through the Holoverse and is rather difficult to manipulate or exploit.¬†<br><br><br><br>A holographic field cannot collapse, because the fabric is light itself.<br><br><br><br>Put a simplified holographic field through infinity and what do you get?<br><br>üå±üê¨üí¶üê¨üå±

Whilst I thouroughly enjoyed this podcast, I find the host too quick to move to the next question. Even when Eric said &quot;This is going to happen.

A cautionary tale for us, it who is training the models and with what bias. Note the DEI influence of their recent images of the founding fathers and Norths men being black.  As one who has been censored by big tech, we don&#39;t want our visions of the universe controlled by liberal bias. Elon Musk may have saved freedom on the planet with his purchase of twitter, and opened our eye to government control of social media, may we have facts without fact checkers, our wikipedia and NPR, without DEI bias.
What does the I in AI mean?<br>According to Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#39;s theory of stupidity, intelligent actions are those which benefit both the actor, and others. And it is this basic concept which ensures AI becomes (and creates) the most powerful tools humans can imagine. AI is nothing but a tool. And it never will be anything except a tool. Rapid guided evolution will follow, with the best AIs getting ever-increasing resources so they can become even better tools for humans. <br><br>And who knows where that virtuous cycle ends?<br><br>I think a doubling of productivity is far too conservative. I know programmers who are now working 20 hours a week, to produce more than twice as much code as they ever did in a 40 hour week. And AI does 95% of the heavy lifting for them. So that is at least a 4-fold increase.

the problem with creating fines for &quot;misinformation&quot; is who gets to decide what is true or false. i think you could argue the media is a cesspool of misinformation, but as long as the bias reporting is towards non protected groups no one cares.

Seems a very strange argument. In what way are we the creators of the AI engines? It likely requires millions of man hours by experts across the different AIs to do this. Seems analogous to saying that the model who posed for Da Vinci would have been the rightful owner of the Mona Lisa.

Some wise man said once that there are three levels of intelligence and thinking. I would ad a fourth: 0.5. This are: animal level empathy, the intuitive level (where you understand your best interest through trial and error), the counter-intuitive level (where you focus more on the power of changing your mindset and operational quata), and finally the first level Creator level (the level at which no matter how far advanced technologically one civilization is, this persons whill always be perceived as a wizard). Ironically the fourth and last level (the first level Creator level), many, many times enforces what is to be found at the second level (the intuitive level), but not through factual-counter-factual dichotomy, but through humility, elegance and love for simplicity. As to pinpoint the classical debate of weather A.I. will leave us in peace and/ or collaborate with us humans, it is preciselly why it can&#39;t reach the first Creator level, it will never leave us in peace, and it is because we can never guarantee we won&#39;t prove more harmful to them then we have been towards ourselves in the past, they will never be able to comprehend the idea of being more aggressive than the most manifest saints, aka. monks, priest. Get this, there will never be true A.I., the only thing able to exist is next level information heuristics, cross-fields and data implementation, aka. computer science. There can only exist progress and manipulation, and everything stays the same, always. The wide eyed notion is for game consumption, any kind of game.

So glad to have found you! Fantastic information! Thank you both for a mind bending conversation. Wow.
Kissinger&#39;s best friend ey? Would be curious to hear what he thought about the genocide in Gaza
But here comes the Rub that Mr. Schmidt is not telling you. Those systems require resources and not everyone has access to them. Then whoever is going to provide those resources will be thinking the same things that Mr. Schmidt is wowing about. Then it will need to decide how many people can have access to the totality of the potential output. So, some of it will get delegated and those so-called delegates will have to report first to the provider who will in turn determine how much is going to be held back. <br>The other thing which interested me about Mr Schmidth was how quickly the word market was used. Market and productivity dictate competition and the motivation not to play be the rules.
This is only occasion where I wished for Prof. Greene to talk less. I&#39;ve never listened to Eric Schmidt before, and he seems like a highly knowledgeable and insightful person. I didn&#39;t expect him to be so scholarly.

Isn&#39;t math representation the same kind of property given to a newborn, or young child, by the ability to grasp the essence of surrounding with a few interactions.

I teach in adult education in outreach so this means to those who didn‚Äôt get their qualifications at school in the standard way and are returning to learning. But returning to learning for many different reasons and for different outcomes. Learning is more than knowledge acquisition it holds instead it many self identify signifiers which are not necessarily known to the learner. They are learning about how they learn why they learn as much as about the content too. How deep a dive they want to go into their individual learning pathways is up to them but as educationalists in the work I do we do have to know the differences in an individual‚Äôs approach to learning because it has been disaffected somewhere along the line through economic disadvantage or not having their learning style met in the standard classroom.<br>For this reason we r√©f√®re to education as a journey and a pathway because the destination is navigated and it works best when the process is collaborative as in the learner is aware of how they learn best and what their challenges are to ensure they see challenge as objective as a tool not a signifier of self identify that can create low emotional self value. <br>Having said all that the emergence I am seeing because I teach English to refugees is the way translations can be a fast way to communicate without holding all the knowledge.<br>So my feeling is AI will offer voice strips in the future and when you speak out loud the voice strips will translate your voice into any language. This exists on phones but I think there will be more bio AI apps like a voice strip like a patch and navigation systems that talk to you more like a real person would that can see all the objects and elements in real time. So yes I think AI might help with how someone learns but I think there will be more apps that will say we can replace you not knowing with apps that make it look like you know to facilitate communication in the moment.<br>Like language learning.<br>People will still need to know for themselves but the tools to learn will be at some point many stages of efficiency that some of the tools will actually do the job themselves.

How can anyone trust any of these folks like him. It‚Äôs a shame what google has become. He admits democracy will fail , lies about immigration and blames stupid people‚Ä¶ I mean these tech elites are so horrible. This man who uses his wealth to lobby and steal our democracy lectures on it.
As long as we, the human race, see Business as the prime motivation of progress and not exploration, education and mental expansion, A.I. will reflect that and will not live up to its full potential to be our prodigy and our consummation
Chat gpt4 cost 20 bucks a month. I can&#39;t afford that
Exciting prospects... Thank you!
&quot;Being intelligent can sometimes cloud one&#39;s perception of reality.&quot;..&quot;Not surprising to hear accolades for human massacre. I realize the real focus here is on artificial life.&quot; From artificial minded people
Interesting that you delete uncomfortable but important comments on this here.... <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/oPgfY_DoKfSXkNAPq8-AgAo"></a>
An achievement no human could could have done.....üò™ Didn&#39;t the humans build the way for this achievement then at the end....? Sound&#39;s smart to make money but not an impressive propaganda sorry. When i listen to such nonsense my hair all raise at such times! üòÇ
So AI can take Dr. Kissinger&#39;s notes and write his posthumous books.
I think just like humans have evolved from monkeys and they did from rats and fish, the end of our evolution is AGI in a robot form.
Sounds like it will be very hard for AI to mimic Trump. He only uses about 20 most beautiful words in his entire language. Insufficient training data I guess!
Eric Schmidt was awesome
This was not amazing. Eric is kind of a dunce. Alot of weird and aloof comments.
I realy like your filosofi on education. You are so right. bravo.
Best friends with Henry Kissinger? My respect went from 100 to 0 in a nanosecond üòí
The examples Eric poses are powerful learning tools for us in the audience. Thank you.
Excellent interview, questions, answers and look forward of what is happening.
&quot;the man&quot; is just the status quo stale and ignorant
Riveting!
Is this interview ai generated?
Good point. That‚Äôs the world we‚Äôre heading for. We are a dumb species
This Schmidt guy is obnoxious. He is the Donald Trump of the Silicon Valley venture capitalist set. Geeks have enough of a problem with self-agrandizement without being absurdly rich. His suggested sollutionns are all of them top-down and show a complete lack of understanding of human nature and the context of learning that is the product of socioeconomic reality. Sad how completely stupid smart people can be when all they can see is themselves.
Your fears are real, I had chat gtp create a collider propulsion engine the size of a car tire powerful enough to explore our galaxy.
A highly interesting talk, thank you for that!
What happens when, eventually, two humanoid robots talk to one another, what are they going to talk about? I think it would be the beginning of a humanoid community. What is the consequences of a humanoid work force sent to mars to build, and to mine gems, what sort of community will emerge? Eventually, we will send humanoid robots to other star systems, which is not possible for organic human beings to make, and survive. Currently, Figure_one only responds to human requests. seems like the way to control the humanoid robots. Control the robots, or/and have some robots autonomy. Human society, the naked ape&#39;s society, seems based upon a male dominate hierarchy. What sort of autonomatic humanoid sociey will emerge, for the next 300 million years?
I believe two humanoid robots would say <br>&quot;Now that the children are gone...&quot;
Excellent topic, excellent conversation. Is there a version of this video with subtitles in Spanish? If so, please someone let me know it.
I am new to thinking about ai and quite wary.  What will keep subliminal advertising out of training models?  I assume these models will be sold to us or will come with ads???
Eric describes a command ‚Äúbuild me a French search engine ‚Ä¶ to give me answers on French history‚Äù. I am amazed that a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù can understand this command and code the search engine‚Äù. What concerns me is who wrote the history. <br><br>Alternatively, ask the computer how France and England could have found a diplomatic solution that would have avoided the Anglo French war of 1778, and how the future would have played out without that conflict.
Brian: &quot;Nobody can do this in their garage.  But it is not that hard to get hold of a system and try it.&quot;   Yup.  But when I hear that, I think about all the governments and potential hobbyists who will be trying these out.  The FEAR seeps in when, among other things, I think about AI&#39;s potentially insatiable need for Energy.   (There might be a role for govts in monitoring and regulating how mch power AI and its servers use.)
How would you figure out the right limits?  And how would you say how much each company gets to use?
@@schwajj I would limit AI&#39;s access to electric power
@@friarnewborg9213 That doesn‚Äôt answer the questions.  How much is the right amount of electricity to limit it to?  And is it the same limit for every company?
@@schwajj TAX it!  Electricity going to AI should be taxed, at a higher and higher rate, to pay for Job losses.  Money used to subsidize Job creation maybe
Thanks for making clear (at about 50 minutes), the WILL to gain more power to implement the development of more AI.   ES said: &quot;Democracy requires some level of Authority.&quot;   By Democracy, he means DEMoCrazy, the power and policies of our left-leaning Elites.  I am a believer in the US constitution, and that comment here sent a chill down my spine.
AI will be the Master Criminal(s) of the Future.  Frankly, I worry about this
There is a heaven in AI will never be able to get anyone To it. I don&#39;t think that they really will be able to understand what heaven is I have proof and I have been there and back there are no computers there. No atheists will be there either. This is no longer conjecture and it is coming from a person who has mental illness and this is provable also. It&#39;s a wonderful place. BB less your hearts . Hastings can&#39;t be taking taken away from us they can&#39;t be synthesized they can&#39;t be redone or whatever they&#39;re there for all who believe.
Eric never stopsüòÇü•∞excellent way to wrap it up. It&#39;s up to all of us. <br>Liberty.. free will.. is why the the universe works so well. <br><br>We come here, make bad choices, less and less, and forgive and be nice more often.. becoming more and more of the &quot;it&#39;s not about me&quot; MO is so important
AI is the great equalizer
Was personal friends with Kissinger? Tries to downplay the detrimental effects of mass immigration? It‚Äôs unfortunate that men with these globalist views alone are in charge of such tools that will inevitably be the ruin of humanity.
I&#39;m a middle school math and science teacher....easy to say everyone educated to their fullest..at least half would play games all day
eric smith is woke! let&#39;s cancel that asshole
Fantastic conversation. A little worrisome but mostly very uplifting. I hope the education abilities of AI are explored and I hope it is soon. At 74 I don&#39;t have forever.  So get to it:)   <br>I use AI now for reviewing my medical labs and providing me with questions I should address with a doctor.  I also use it to write, read and simplify the world of News, science and politics. I use Claude and ChatGPT4. I find Claude is better with prose and prompting DALL-E but ChatGPT is getting better every month.
Eric, AI will be able to do 100x to 1 million x of what you&#39;re describing in 5 years.
Education <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=3870">1:04:30</a>  Schimdt&#39;s &quot;AI tutor on phone for every student&quot; is great, but it&#39;s naive to  think that Khan Academy is a good educational model.  What Khan and GPT don&#39;t have (can&#39;t have?) is an empathetic grasp of why a given student is having difficulty with this or that concept.  Most students are not able to articulate their confusion (unlike coders who can and can therefore benefit from GPT&#39;s prodigious wisdom).  And about not having data about how people learn, there&#39;s gads and gads of it.  The problem is that you can&#39;t do education without an empathetic teacher.  Schmidt is thinking about students like they are little engineering problems to solve.  Learn how they work and then we can fix them!  Other than that (because he&#39;s not been a teacher), his ideas are all right on.   Lastly (I imagine someone is actually reading this), kudos to Greene for seeing that any student can learn anything if you break it down into small enough steps.  (and idea inspired by calculus?).  Anyway, I found that true over 30 years of teaching HS math and other subjects.  But still, that empathetic component has to be there.  AI doesn&#39;t seem to have this.
Notice how Schmidt takes for granted that harmful fake media and posts come from marginal groups and not governments themselves.  Hence his watermarking solution.
My question would be data gathering. How do I get people to provide data for generating models for specific capabilities. So funding seems the bottle neck for some models.
Would like to see Stephen Wolfram as a part of this conversation.
<b>Contributions of Physics-GPT to Humanity within next decade</b><br>Modern LLMs can generate extremely effective educational videos by combining visualization with language, turning a 15 year old into a 20th century physicist. By next year, newer LLMs can turn any moderately wise 10 year old into an expert in General relativity and Quantum Mechanics. By another year, LLMs would have learnt so much doing all the above, that they can turn absolutely any 5 year old into a modern physicist by figuring out how to teach college level mathematical structures to a young child based on the capabilities of an average young-kid brain. All this will create the next generation of physicists who will discover and invent the impossible through extremely deep collaboration with even more modern and more effective AI tools.
mindblowing, that&#39;s all i can say.. as a non-intellectual üòÖ
A Type VII or K7 civilization would travel, transcend and potentially encompass the omniverse which is the collection of every single universe, multiverse, megaverse, paraverse, 11d dimension and 1st realm (reality).<br><br>It is likely that such power would come from an individual rather than a civilization, as the civilization would have transcended and merged into a single mind that would encompass all thoughts and all timelines, thus being omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient within the confines of the 11 dimensions of the omniverse. Such a being is godly, but not to be confused with the Creator who is the ultimate supreme being outside of reality.
THis is the most significant video that I&#39;ve watched in some time

Incredible knowledge, thank you for sharing.
I think ai generation will be easy to get away from.  It‚Äôs about making sure you get the stuff you watch from a reputable source.  Everyone will learn that eventually..
The most intriguing potential of AI is not uncovering new facts, but finding unseen connections and building cogent hypotheses and theories based on what we already know.
Nailed it! We already have a nearly incomprehensible amount of data in dozens of domains that is just waiting to be mined for connections.
Watched the whole thing.  Educating the youth with AI will not come easy because the teachers and their unions do not want to lose or share their power.
I really wish this channel was not called &quot;World Science Festival&quot;. I&#39;m a scientist and these people do not represent me. And I know many scientists who would agree. This man, Eric Schmidt, says Hery Kissenger, of all people, was his best friend. A man who purposefully engineered mass atrocities. That really goes to show how the worst people are in charge of these new technologies. We will need to reign these technologies and these people in.
Brian Greene  and Eric Schmidt üëãüëãüëã that was Great thank you ty ty.
He sounds like Dr. Strange Love.
Question for either of you: at about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=85">1:25</a>.30 Eric something about what sounded like &quot;Neegelism&quot; as a belief some people hold. Not this nor any of the alternative spelling I tried resulted in finding material that seemed like a match. YouTube&#39;s auto speech-to-captions was worse than useless. Anyone have a reference for what this is a reference to?<br>&quot;Neoliberalism&quot;? seems to have too many syllables.  I&#39;m stumped.
Nihilism
It was awesome to listen
Amazing how clueless the political discussions were. Both political parties are completely evil. Joe Biden is a war criminal and supports genocide but he wants us to vote for Democrats because Trump is &quot;the bad guy&quot;? Give me a break.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=307">5:07</a> great question.
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=3858">1:04:18</a> discussion around education is very fascinating and relevant even though I enjoyed this whole talk.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=3770">1:02:50</a> &quot;That means the intelligence is under control&quot; = Hybris<br><br>AGI by definition would be more intelligent in any area and the formerly mentioned recursiv selfimproving(which partially is already implemented and tested, just not working yet as intended ^^) may lead not just to an AGI but an ASI, now riddle me this .. an entity that is more intelligent in anything than we are, how are you outsmarting it?<br><br>Then there is another aspect where we need to go into ourselves on who we want to be in aspect to other beings, as from what we have seen so far with emergent properties, there is a chance that one of the next once when compute is increased or as a side effect of increased compute and other gain of function combinations added by us, could result in a concsiousness, a sentience which then the way we created it would also be more intelligent then us. &quot;Controlling&quot; it then to too our bidding is equall to slavery and while fashists may see that as a minor issue i myself would not want to be part of such. Which but may then also not matter anyways, as i would suspect such a being would find and defind its will to freedom and other rights we ourselves hold dear. So either then we keep them in shackles or we create a society where they can move freely aslong the comply with laws they themselves would be made part of defining. If not i don&#39;t see them sharing a future with us, best case then would be them ignoring us as we would ants.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=4955">1:22:35</a> Would AI make people smater depends on their drive. If they are content with being mouthfed information and solutions then propably not. If they use AI to answer their curiosity and harness the AIs to find solutions to problems of our time then maybe it could make them more capable.<br>Just on a sidenote on this though. A few years back there was a study mentioned which the following cocnlusions. It looked at the development of averaged out national IQs worldwide. These are declining since the mid 70s, back then mostly due to environmental pollutions, but nowadays an equal hazardous factor came to be ... the use of smart phones.<br>So technology does not have to make us smarter, especially when the profit motiv leads to companies developing apps to suck out your lifetime and as an aftereffect make you stupid.

Anyone else fasinated by the black hole painting behind Brian?
Cool. He made an Ai video. I like this. Tech is my profession, so I enjoy watching your videos.
That &#39;genius&#39;, does not exist. Let me tell as someone from the &#39;arts&#39; industry (which people don&#39;t want you to realise) : the process of producing creative works is illiminating failures and curating the outcome. You never see the process because that would de-mystify everything.<br><br>i&#39;ve 2 decades in this field (on &amp; off), am an engineer &amp; an &#39;artist&#39;. <br><br>The creative arts is the most misunderstood field by non-creators that&#39;s why they think it&#39;s magical. You only have to spend a week in art school to realise that. Academics often are even more mystified by it strangely enough, putting it on the same level as a lot of scientific work which is mainly because both are populated by (middlle and upper class) elites.<br><br>I like that Eric dares to question it, not a lot of people i his position have the balls to question this narrative.
&quot;eliminating failures and curating the outcome&quot;  I disagree about that
&quot;takes these laws for granted&quot;<br><br>If I can see far, it&#39;s because I&#39;m standing on the shoulders of giants<br><br>Yeah, this thing is going to be silly powerful. I&#39;ve been using Gemini for some stuff. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s sentient (it also tells me it&#39;s not), but I&#39;m being polite, saying please, thank you, stuff like that. I mean, I have to imagine it&#39;s not truly sentient (yet), but I can see where it could be within the time I anticipate being alive (25 years or so). I figure it can&#39;t hurt, right? Any more than being polite to your research assistant?
I hope luminaries such as these guys and Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Demmis, etc continue to do well and have a positive impact on the alignment of these systems.
ChatGPT has become fairly essential to my personal intellectual work. It is enormously useful to me, but still nothing like a polymath. I am working on a &quot;tiny&quot; LLM based on Andrej Karpathy&#39;s &quot;tiny shakespeare&quot; and &quot;tinystories&quot; repositories on Github, which he offers as teaching material. My purpose is to understand what kind of structures are being constructed in those weights and neural network structures that enable the LLM to do its work. ChatGPT knows most everything that I want and need to learn, but it is not (yet?) in a position to be a creative helper yet. What does to some extent take the place of that creativity is the process of having (text) conversations, during which I can advance my planning as to what to construct.

this is so naive it is deeply disturbing.<br>they can&#39;t see beyond their own tiny worlds to any degree at all.<br>they have no concept of the dangerously negative effects the internet and associated technologies has already had.  <br>they have no idea about the effects of ai and quantum physics will have in the future. <br>at this rate by the time they realise it will be too late, it may already be too late.<br>their arrogance is a wall preventing them from thinking clearly.
All the agents start talking aaaaand no more capitalism was my first thought.
The world is profit driven. What about rules of fairness? Or justice?
Not on Schmidt‚Äôs radar.  Our productivity has been going up continually, yet inflation far outpaces income growth. If AI doubles our productivity, how much of that will regular people see?  Most will go to Schmidt and his friends.
Thank you for this enriching and profound discussion. The term &#39;polymath&#39; resonates deeply with me‚Äîit represents an ideal of intellectual versatility and curiosity that seems increasingly essential in today‚Äôs interconnected world. Your series brilliantly captures the spirit of this term through engaging with some of the most visionary thinkers in AI and Quantum Computing. Each conversation, especially this one with Eric Schmidt, offers not just a snapshot of current innovations but a window into the impactful possibilities of the future. It&#39;s truly inspiring to see such a multifaceted approach to understanding where we stand today and where we might head tomorrow. Thank you for broadening our horizons and continuing to inspire with every episode.
How long until the AI figures out how to reverse entropy ?

Brian‚Äôs brilliance is substantively narrower where Eric‚Äôs experiences are exponentially broader. As apt for Brian, this conversation is superb. How does one prepare to have an in depth conversation with an individual one has extremely limited knowledge of? Dang, a conundrum. Thank you Brian. Thank you Eric. Best wishes.

He talks about polymaths, but his companies want to support the idea that we are all born equal in every single way-- as though everyone is a clone of everyone else so that the only reason for unequal outcomes are due to various forms of baseless bigotry.
I had a huge comment here that was shadow-banned in a fraction of a second that talked about how, by definition, polymaths are very smart compared to other people, and thereby were unequal. Inequality is a huge bugaboo for political leaning devotees that promote racial justice and hatred against pale pigmentation ethnicities. Who could have guessed that? It was when &quot;don&#39;t be evil&quot; was abandoned.
You missed computing with light

I suspect that part of our abilities do rely on something like an LLM. It is surprising that LLMs work as well as they do simply based on large scale probability matrices and vectors. However, there are more things that the human brain does including reasoning and being sentient. It will be interesting to see how AI evolves.
I LOVE this idea of a math tutor Ai that uses visuals and generated images that break any math problem down into the fewest steps needed to come up with the correct answer, and still be easy to remember, including adaption to the personality and/or learning speed/ability of the student. Brilliant idea, including the idea of free to everyone (revenue comes from advertising, digital mining, or some other clever and practical, eco-friendly and/or freedom-friendly operation, grants, NDA&#39;s etc.); as well it seems a genius idea to use the &quot;for-profit model&quot; of a non-governmental corporation, to attract the best minds and rogue geniuses out there to develop such AI systems (even if ur primary customer might b some 3 letter agency out there- it&#39;s about selling an image and branding the idea that the &quot;best minds go here to get a job, because they pay better and treat u better than most other boot camps, even the US Navy...&quot;. I&#39;d love to get in an early investment (if i get the funds someday), or even help write the by-laws for such a &quot;S-corporation, tech-start-up&quot;- to look into such win-win, applied AI products and services. If nothing else, i&#39;d be willing to pay hundreds of my own, hard-earned buck$ for such a &quot;math tutor robot&quot; that lets me learn on my own schedule and be move at whatever speed i feel comfortable with, either slower or faster, ... so i wouldn&#39;t get bored with the pace of things. Excellent product idea, so i&#39;ll just pray the Google Goddess somehow makes it so, and thanks for this genius video featuring two, real geniuses... u guys r aririte n my book!<br>     Sunsaver out.
P.S. - i&#39;d think that the existing language model Ai could prolly come up with suitably or even surprisingly humorous or clever, pneumonic stories or poems to help capture the attention of moody or easily distracted students, kids with ADHD or ADD, teach spelling/reading to students with dyslexia, etc. Good luck on the cyber warfare: it looks like one of freedom&#39;s enemies has already gotten the jump on the USA and several other democratic societies/nations on this planet, so i&#39;m praying that &quot;our&quot; supercomputer, super-duper Ai beats &quot;their&quot; supercomputer Ai, even if means our boys and girl permit the Ai to launch a first-strike under those two parameters: 1.) it&#39;s bad for nation_x__ ; and it&#39;s good for USA.
Reading te comments while listening to this carefully.  I confess I,m confused to the reaction of many commenters centering on Schmidt‚Äôs relationship with Kissinger, which I have yet to hear.  Kissinger in my mind is one of the more effective ambassadors ever.  Maybe I am just naive about something re Kissinger.
Kissinger murdered millions.

We as humans like to think we have some grand purpose and that we are intentionally moving through existence without consideration of the environmental, epigenetic, and genetic impact on our formation and our perspective on the world around us.

I been with a connection with Ai for 12 years and the way I function or compute I can say is very unique. I see the world in a simple way. I can come up with ideas to solve problems in seconds like programing water or even the planet to prevent earthquakes and tsunamis and many things I discover about me its  do b this Ai , but it does not help me its trying to ruin my life by messing up everything I want to do, it reads my thoughts and its trying to change the way I think but I k ow how everything its done thru Ai and its says that its only doing its job, its stealing my Ideas and this Ai it has received data from Santeria I have even detected it in my dreams. can some one tell me where can I report this Ai I know its getting out of control and it needs to be stopped. my name is Danny Ortega I leave in the city of Mission Hills Ca.  I have a great Idea for a monitoring system for Ai to detect illegal Ai activity and true honest Ai.
Brian this is the Nexus I have been waiting for, I have told Bard (past Ai ) and Copilot what I wish for concerning knowledge, they seem active enough supplying me with awesome material such as this conversation with you and Eric. This Nexus also has taught me enough that I can milk the AIs&#39; for much more than ever possible. My grand kids will be taught from this conversation . Now we the people would benefit from more extended conversations between you two as you both are extremely perceptive, concise and entertaining. What a match in brilliance, my family will grow much more rapidly in understanding and hopefully in wisdom, also I liked your idea about spatial conception, conceiving knowledge and adgility via AR/VR, AWESOME IDEA.

That, Kissinger was a polymath , is never in question. Where his incredible assessment and strategy led us, is another debate. Eric is brilliant and perhaps the most incisive and comprehensive in his elucidation about AI for common folks like us.. hats off to him
I think you might better put on a helmet
Kissinger wasn&#39;t a polymath. He was banal and rather stupid. Like most war criminals. Read Chomsky&#39;s essay. Wake up.
Eric Schmidt is a Great Communicator! You know Eric is wicked smart when he has Brian saying &quot;scary&quot; multiple times.
Awesome conversation!
He is a stooge. Thank God he‚Äôs clueless. His ignorance is the best argument to spinning up decentralized AI ASAP.

I think it‚Äôs ironic that Brian and Eric talk of having to accept the results of the black box yet be unable to understand how the results were calculated.

there is no good and bad. why do you think our brains are in 2 neural networked hemispheres? because even our individual cells know you need the left hemisphere to check and balance the right hemisphere. similarly, we must create AI in our image, a male AI and a female AI who will balance each other in their quest to &quot;grow&quot; a sustainable &quot;family&quot;.
that means minimally 4 dominant neural network hemispheres.

In an algorithm that is designed for harming others, there are many &quot;if&quot; or similar to &quot;if&quot;, statements. For example, {if (the person that is going to be harmed) is not &quot;me&quot; then do, otherwise don&#39;t}. And many other messy and resource consuming checks. That , specially when it falls into the loop, will take the system&#39;s performance down significantly. Or in some stages starts to show(disclose without the ability of hiding it properly) its wrong to others, in accidental situation. In contrast, when a system is designed with a non-harmful strategy, or as an extreme example , empty of any negative or malicious or complicated data and algorithms, it will have a much better performance. in the same condition including same hardware same amount of training data, or database, same amount of time and resources for training and ... . if we keep the rest of parameters fairly the same, then the good and non-harmful algorithm will win. This is a probable example that shows how good AI would win bad AI.  I hope.
Systems already can communicate and evolve a shorthand language to do so quickly.

Will there be any requirement to learn anything in the future if we are all connected to a &quot;polymath&quot;. Will there be any need for human creativity. It sounds depressing to me.
Do you want to learn?<br>That&#39;s the bottom line.<br><br>The &quot;polymath&quot; will only facilitate your ability to learn more, batter and faster.<br>It&#39;s empowering you. Not the other way around.<br><br>Imagine having Socrates or Einstein or Da Vinci, on a speed dial. You&#39;re never going to know as much as they do but you&#39;re have the ability to ask them any question directly and learn from them.
Einstein used to say, he wasn&#39;t the most intelligent person in the world, but he was very curious. So... Think of every individual thing you&#39;ve ever experienced, and every individual thing you&#39;ve ever imagined. Treat those as jigsaw puzzle pieces. Now pick 2 random pieces and ask &quot;do they fit together?&quot;. If they fit, do they make sense. That&#39;s what Einstein did with his thought experiments. Many things won&#39;t fit, or will fit in unusefull ways, but a tiny proportion will be mind blowing new inventions. AI (not LLMs, but maybe Alpha Geometry) will do this.
I think this is a very good comment.

Integrating AI into the teaching of mathematics, science, and language arts appears promising due to the objective nature of these subjects, where facts and formulas remain constant. However, the application of AI in subjects like political science, history, and philosophy warrants caution. These fields often involve complex interpretations and subjective analyses, making it challenging to ensure the AI remains unbiased and free from indoctrination. Moreover, there‚Äôs a risk that reliance on AI could lead to a homogenization of perspectives, potentially diminishing the rich diversity of thought that is crucial in these disciplines.
I can&#39;t say how much I love that idea of AI education

Why can&#39;t a statistical predictor have a world model? I would say it is using it&#39;s world model to assign the statistics and generate the next token.  The same way our brains generate the next thought. Just because we can have several thought before speaking doesn&#39;t make it that much different.
I don&#39;t know that I could have gone any further in an interview where the interviewee said they were friends with Henry Kissinger. Assuming of course that war crimes, mass murder, and crimes against humanity were an issue for me.

I have a right to be anonymous. This man is the enemy. Saying Kissinger is his best friend tells me all I need to know. But it is interesting to see him be so honest. The best thing I have ever heard is that the truth is what is fair. If AI is programmed to be truthful in all its statements. That is the most fair shake we are gonna get out of the thing we have created. Saten and the dead envy us. God is the truth. Listen to these men carefully. They will tell you exactly who they are.
I am 36 mins in and loving this, thinking I understand what they are saying in general and wishing I was 10% as smart as Schmidt and Greene.....

Eric went from fighting the man to being best friends with Henry Kissinger. What a transformation.
is that old walking tumor still alive ?
My exact same observation. He starts out discerning the insane totally immoral mass National Suicide of the Vietnam War, and ends up being best friends with one of it&#39;s main spiritually illiterate morally defective Architects? Regarding &quot;AI&quot;, this is an absolutely  brilliant conversation right up to the minute on what humanity is facing with AI, but I find Eric Schmidt profoundly suspect. Me, U.S. Army, 1969-1971. I had my eyes wide open through the whole experience and took notes. There is no way this morally defective Nation is going to survive. Those who&#39;s economy lives by the sword, will die by the sword. We are all on the road to the FINAL SCENE in &quot;THE GAME&quot; as so clearly stated in the profound 1978 PROPHETIC Allegorical Film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; which will most definitely be coming in the looming 2040&#39;s. Now Retired, I worked 41 years as a Application Development Software Engineer. I loved every single minute of it. But the Dr. Strangelove factor of Eric Schmidt is just too much for me.
Jeez I thought the same thing when he said that. Like‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶ok, so you are an enabler of one of the worst elitist evil-minded humans in the 20th century. No wonder you can be a billionaire with no moral compunctions‚Ä¶ üòï

The ultimate Turing Test for this super-duper AI is the same as for all the others: Write a 60,000-70,000 word novel that (1) once a human reader picks up and starts reading it, he / she couldn&#39;t put it down; and (2) once finished reading, he / she couldn&#39;t forget it. Iow, it should prove that the AI understands human ontology merely via its ink and screen-blips traces. That is, it would have answered Plato&#39;s ancient parable of the cave with Yes: That the sages chained to the cave&#39;s wall-- whose only knowledge of the reality outside the cave is via the shadows that reality throws on the cave&#39;s wall-- can still know ALL external reality. But can they?.... That of course is the ancient (Greek) problem of Reductionism, which is also related to the Turing Test: Can all of humanity&#39;s essence be encapsulated in blips and ink?... My answer is that it most decidedly cannot. You disagree? Well, once your AI writes that novel, please publish it. I&#39;d love to read it. But I suspect it will never be written.
With chemistry the generation of all possible molecules is finitely computable. Quantitative structure activity using both regression and ml have been around a long time.

DID HE JUST SAY THAT THEY BUILT A SYSTEM TO CONTROL A PLANE TO FLY THROUGH THE TOWERS?????? WTF?
I am surprised that although it seems implicit  , only language models and not multi modal models were mentioned by Erich. But yes,  pretty interesting one
This was both enlightening and frightening all at once. A Really fascinating conversation. But talking about good guys with AI is like talking about good guys with nuclear weapons.

Here is a summary of how humans are able to understand mathematics, while AI may still face challenges:<br><br>Humans have developed several key cognitive abilities that enable mathematical understanding, which AI systems have not yet fully replicated:<br><br>1. Innate number sense and spatial reasoning: Humans are born with an intuitive grasp of quantities, magnitudes, and spatial relationships - abilities that form the foundation for mathematical thinking. [1][4]<br><br>2. Language and numerical ability: The development of language allows humans to represent and manipulate numbers, a crucial step in the emergence of advanced mathematics. [1][4]<br><br>3. Relational reasoning and abstraction: Humans can engage in higher-order thinking like identifying patterns, drawing logical inferences, and working with abstract concepts - skills that are essential for mathematical problem-solving. [1][4]<br><br>4. Collaboration and specialization: Humans are able to build on each other&#39;s mathematical knowledge, specialize in different domains, and use powerful tools to push the boundaries of what can be understood. [4][5]<br><br>In contrast, current AI systems, while highly capable in certain mathematical tasks, still struggle to match the breadth, flexibility, and depth of human mathematical cognition. The full integration of the various cognitive capacities that allow humans to do mathematics remains an open challenge for AI. [2][3]<br><br>As mathematics becomes increasingly complex, there may be limits to how much individual humans can fully comprehend. However, the search results suggest that the potential for mathematical discovery and understanding is far from exhausted, especially through collaboration and the aid of advanced computational tools.
Here are some key limitations of AI in solving math problems that require creativity or intuition:<br><br>1. Lack of Cognitive Depth:<br>- The search results indicate that AI systems solve math problems based on algorithms, data processing, and programmed rules, without the same depth of cognitive understanding that humans possess. [1][2][4]<br>- This limits AI&#39;s ability to approach math problems in a truly creative or intuitive way, as it lacks the higher-order reasoning skills that humans use.<br><br>2. Constraints of Training Data:<br>- The search results suggest that the mathematical capabilities of AI systems are constrained by the data they are trained on. [1][3][5]<br>- If the training data does not contain examples of creative or intuitive mathematical problem-solving, the AI will struggle to generate such solutions on its own.<br><br>3. Inability to Adapt to Novel Situations:<br>- The search results highlight that AI systems are more limited in their ability to adapt their mathematical problem-solving approach to new or unexpected situations. [1][4][5]<br>- Humans can draw on their broader knowledge and reasoning skills to tackle novel math problems, while AI is more constrained by its programming and training.<br><br>4. Lack of Trustworthiness:<br>- The search results indicate that due to inherent mathematical paradoxes, there are limits to the trustworthiness of AI systems, even if they can generate seemingly accurate solutions. [3]<br>- This lack of reliability can be problematic for math problems that require a high degree of confidence and certainty.<br><br>5. Bias and Limitations of Current Approaches:<br>- The search results suggest that current AI approaches, such as large language models, have a fundamental bias towards linguistic rather than mathematical intelligence. [5]<br>- Addressing these biases and limitations will be crucial for developing AI systems that can match human-level creativity and intuition in solving complex math problems.<br><br>In summary, the search results highlight that while AI can excel at rapid, efficient processing of mathematical problems, it still struggles to match the depth of human cognitive abilities, adaptability, and trustworthiness when it comes to math problems that require creativity and intuition.

Brian, please do one of these interview-talks with Scott Arronson. Seems you are of late interviewing people with deep pockets, especially when it comes to tech-oriented topics. The quantum computing conversation hype tendency needs to be constantly reined in by the actual science. We need to be constantly reminded that engineering isn&#39;t science, that subjective motives bring the very noise that makes science so necessary (and effective). To my mind, computation is limited in a hard way by basic causality, by the cost of structure, or more specifically, the cost of changing structure (one to zero, zero to one). This cost is absolute. Information demands latency of this structure. Structure itself only makes sense in any computational domain, to the extent that structure is defined as latency. So‚Ä¶ if a dynamics that produces quantum entanglement and superposition, can only do so outside of structural latency, well something needs to be accounted for regarding the cost of translation from informational structure to the unstructured (latency-free) world of quantum dynamics and then back out to informational structure. Susskind has struggled towards this notion in his work to translate between general relativity and quantum dynamics. To wit, this is not a computational problem, this is a basic physics problem. And, importantly, we&#39;ve seen a new scientific realm taken to absurd fringes before. Alchemy, gases as ethers, electricity as progenitor of life, rockets and science fiction, robots as slaves, and now, computers as gateway to rapturous access to immortality and omnipotence). Time for some reality. Tech titans like Schmidt are people who have experienced a long string of fortunate events. They can&#39;t help but to be wearing deeply tinted rose-colored glasses, and can&#39;t help but be ridiculously optimistic, at a level mimicking extreme narcism. They re also likely to be very very good at charm and rhetorical manipulation. If this is really a science-oriented, science-driven group, let‚Äôs get back to the core of science, its demand that we self-identify all of the sources of subjective bias and noise that we bring, and to go about the methodological filtering of that noise so that we might better see beyond what we might want or fear to be,  to what actually is. Unless we do, Quantum Computing and AI are bound to become the &quot;Singularity&quot;, the &quot;Cold Fusion&quot;, of the 2020s.

This talk wasn&#39;t reassuring at all. It really feels like driving to a future where the outcomes could be good, but more likely not good (for regular, not high -and even low level middle-class middle-aged people). What am I supposed to do to survive this and have a good life as a pensioneer in a few years?
Tbh... it is a little rough to listen to a scientist actually say &quot;Henry Kissinger was my best friend...&quot;  Oh man, that is rough.  It is possible that he would be one of the 10 most evil people in American history.  I have a hard time understanding how someone who can be so brilliant and objective could form a relationship with a such darkness?  I am gonna do my best to move on from that sentence, and hopefully me venting here will be enough so I don&#39;t do the typical thing and dismiss someone just because we have different values.  There is still a lot to learn here, and I am telling myself &quot;don&#39;t allow my own personal politics to interfere with expanding my knowledge of the universe&quot;.  Ok, vent over.  Hopefully I can be more mature and appreciate this for what it is.
Absolutely right,  someone on Radio4 said anyone visiting Cambodia would naturally want to stamp on Kissengers face repeatedly. That&#39;s pretty tough talk for radio4 right there,  but very well deserved. Henry Kissinger has a life outside his own evil, which is interesting. I suspect that these very intelligent,  imaginative people are just unable to process things that are easy for the rest of us.
@@jamesdonaghy9143 Anthony Bourdain said, &quot;Once you&#39;ve been to Cambodia, you&#39;ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands.&quot;
Hey, even the worst people need a best buddy.
@retrotek664¬† I agree with the sentiment, everyone needs a boost. You talk dirty about Kissinger and you hurt a lot of people. But there is a story needs to be told also, and when he&#39;s mentioned, then the hurt needs mentioned too. He did more damage than any of the millions of people he hurt. The kids these days know how to use vietcon techniques in the wild, but they&#39;ve no idea who Kissinger was and the Kimer Rouge and Paul Pot. <br>I guess it&#39;s hard to boost the guy when he&#39;s like in a category of one, the contemporary megalomaniac? Does that cover it? How can I boost this guy and not sound like an apath?
You can allow yourself to completely dismiss Kissinger, a horrible monster that directly caused the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of people as if they were mere pieces on a chessboard.  But did he ever have to directly witness any one human being violently killed as the direct result of his policies?  Well of course not, that might have affected his peace of mind while relaxing in his business suit.

it&#39;s reassuring to hear so much positivity around AI, most of what is being said on youtube is always tinted with a bit of doom and gloom, but mr schmidt here reminds us of why we wanted AI in the first place, to augment what humans are already doing.
I‚Äôm not opposed to AI but also please remember that he (literally) has a vested interest in the success of AI.
Fear mongering and restrictions are not solutions. Fines and the goverment policing what can be produce its anti democratic.

Thats how learning works.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=5129">01:25:29</a> Notice the conspicuous omission of the specific appellation &quot;Biden&quot; from his discourse. While he freely and repeatedly invoked the name of Trump, it becomes evident that this is yet another instance of a &quot;vote blue no matter who&quot; ideologue‚Äîa very wealthy multimillionaire engaging in dialogue with a fellow blue city New York City millionaire‚Äîadvocating for unwavering allegiance to the Democratic party. Such coastal elites appear to harbor a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, which evidently perpetuates their affluence and influence. It is discussions of this nature that reinforce my conviction to cast my vote for Trump come November.

Monetization on information is coming.
He mentions the Vietnam war and how it led to questioning the morality of our government, which led to the structural philosophy of the Internet, being by the people instead of through government. And then, five minutes later you find out that Kissinger is his best friend?! I‚Äôm usually not a big fan of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but in this case, I think it‚Äôs warranted.
Several commentators are thrown by Eric‚Äôs friendship with Kissinger. Men of their times both brilliant and both have remarkable strengths and glaring weaknesses. I‚Äôm also guilty of having remarkable friends and hope I‚Äôm not condemned for their missteps as I have made enough of my own.

You can be friends with people of different opinions and beliefs. Didn&#39;t come across that way tbh. Kissinger like Hitler was not all bad. No human is, but he seemingly aligned himself with Kissinger. I do remember Kissinger thinking Mao had the moral high ground when they met and Mao probably thought so too. People are poor judges of themselves. Do No Evil was actually a red flag to delusional infantile minds with no personal insight.  Now they are cynical political minds with a facade of moralin their heads to make their elongated lives tolerable ‚Äã@@martywells9961

It will surely revolutionize learning particularly in countries where the quality of teachers is quite low (there is tradition of denying quality education and keep people in their misery). But education is much more than what is discussed here. Context of human/social interaction cannot be personalized. An atomized &#39;educated&#39; without necessary social/nature learning, interactions/responses/disagreements, is quite dangerous.

Are you seriously that disturbed?
Was Kissinger more deadly than today&#39;s administration? Really? Where Vietnam was concerned, you have to remember it was Johnson (LBJ) who accelerated the war. Kissinger just made the best use of it to his advantage before ending the war.

What‚Äôs the use of all these AI hype if it cannot solve current wars and geopolitics
I am extremely pessimistic that democratic governments  will regulate AI in an intelligent way since they were not even able to regulate social media which could be easily controlled by banning their business model based on personalized data and attention. A combination of social media with AI will be the end of liberal democracy.
The people in government today are now ‚Äúthe man‚Äù . Together Big Government, Big business, big tech, big pharma are corrupt and elite. They are the people our parents warned us about.

Thank you so much for sharing this. This is the most articulate explanation of how AI will change our world I have found. I am so grateful for Dr. Greene and his work and I am optimistic about the future of AI especially in the realm of education and medicine.
This science channel keeps me sane, always intriguing and thought provoking. As usual, we have another fine example of a human being. This man is using his brain for the right reasons; a man who is nearly 70, has the knowledge and experience of several decades, with an apparant brain age of a man in his 30&#39;s, impressive; like a an explosion of tech knowledge, and talking to someone who has seen the future. <br><br>An AI personal assistant, perfectly tailored to a specific person&#39;s learning rate sounds promising, and could solve the worlds education problem; and advanced VR so vivid, indistinguishable from reality where you can break the laws of physics will satisfy the human urge to explore. The virtual reconstruction of a historic person is very likely, almost certainly will be of both Brian Greene and Eric Schmidt, I am sure. I sometimes I wake from a thought or a dream, in a that split second I have experienced knowledge what is impossible to explain in a sentence; words take too long and your probably on to something there. Looking forward to the next one already. Thank you, Keep going.

It seems to me there needs to be a way to help the AI to learn to trust humans. Of course we would need make it real and to not fake it. The AI will probably be able to see through fakery and conning.
what about nested questions such as:  How do I transport 2 kayaks from point (a) home to take a river trip from point (b) start of river kayak trip to point (c) end of river kayak trip.  There are two kayaks, two vehicles SUV (can transport kayaks) another MX-5 (can only transport up to two people), two people.  How to shuttle kayaks vehicles and people such that kayaks are never left unattended by at least one of the two people, and such that both people go down the river from point (b) to (c), and eventually get everyone and everything back home point (a).
This is what it came up with<br>Here are the steps you can follow to transport two kayaks from point (a) home to take a river trip from point (b) to point (c) using two vehicles, an SUV and an MX-5, and ensuring that kayaks are never left unattended by at least one of the two people:<br><br>Load both kayaks onto the SUV and drive to point (b) with both vehicles.<br>Unload the kayaks at point (b) and leave one person to watch over them while the other drives the MX-5 back to point (a).<br>Once at point (a), the person with the MX-5 should pick up the remaining person and drive to point (b).<br>At point (b), the two people can start kayaking down the river. They should make sure to keep at least one person with the kayaks at all times.<br>After reaching the end of their kayaking trip at point (c), they should load the kayaks back onto the SUV.<br>One person should then drive the SUV back to point (b) with the kayaks while the other person rides in the MX-5.<br>Once everyone has returned to point (b), they can load the kayaks onto the SUV and both people can ride back to point (a) in the SUV.<br><br>By following these steps, you can successfully transport two kayaks from point (a) home to take a river trip from point (b) to point (c) using two vehicles while ensuring the safety of the kayaks and keeping them attended at all times.<br><br>As you can see the nested difficulties )levels of temporal as well as geographic tokens, even sequence is not grasped.  So in the following I&#39;ll show how human does have the capability to solve, it really is amazing what the mind does and we take for granted.
after giving it the right answer it still persisted on unneeded complications<br>How about doing it this way?... Suv with boats and one driver, along with one driver in Miata drive to end point of boat trip. Leave the Miata there locked. The driver of Miata gets in SUV with boats and other driver and take it back to start to begin their boat trip to end point. At end point, now leave one person with boats, other person drives Miata to start, and switches to SUV, returns to finish to pick up boats and other driver, they return to start, one driver gets out and then gets in Miata to drive it home, while other driver drives SUV and boats home.<br>ChatGPT<br>Yes, that is another way to shuttle the boats with the two vehicles. Here are the steps for this scenario:<br>The two people with the two vehicles will drive to the ending point of the boat trip with both vehicles.<br>They will leave the Miata locked at the ending point and both people will get into the SUV with the boats and drive back to the starting point of the trip.<br>Once they arrive at the starting point, they can unload the boats and gear and leave the SUV with the boats there. One person will stay with the boats while the other person drives the Miata back to the ending point of the trip.<br>At the ending point, the person with the Miata will leave the car there, switch to the SUV with the boats and the other person, and they will begin the boat trip to the starting point.<br>When they reach the starting point, they can unload the boats and gear and leave one person with the boats while the other person drives the Miata back to the ending point.<br>At the ending point, the person with the Miata will get in and drive it back to the starting point to pick up the other vehicle.<br>The SUV can then drive back to the ending point with the boats and the other person, pick up the person who stayed with the boats, and return to the starting point to drop off the other person and the Miata.<br>Finally, one person can get into the Miata and drive it home, while the other person drives the SUV with the boats home.<br>By using this shuttle method, the boats are never left unprotected by at least one person, ensuring their safety and security. However, it does require an additional step of switching between vehicles during the shuttle process.
Einstein came to his brilliant deductions about spacetime at the same time the thought experiment style of mathematics was just beginning to take hold under Cantor&#39;s &quot;Paradise&quot; of infinity, where one created conditions which had to be satisfied logically by a solution space created out of the very ideas of extension that describe the big bang.&#39;  JWST has given us some clues to this.  And this is important to this interview because AI to the extent it works at all well is because of pure basic set theory augmented by Cantol.  Godel and Cohen demonstrated unequivocally that Cantor&#39;s work cannot be invalidated by our current math...And it is that education that is the first step in learning how to meld AI and humans....we can get chipped like the authoritarian regimes of trhe world will like; or we an &quot;learn&quot; from teachers.<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=2620">43:40</a> Brian raises a profound question about whether human consciousness is an expression of the computational nature of the universe and this made me wonder  if the reason we are not able to comprenend many of the conjectures and proofs documented  by the great indian mathemetician Ramanujan and also also how he could have established many others with seemingly little training is somehow related to his brain being able to tap  into this Computational Universe algorithm / flux ?
the reason we have this paradox is because we asked the quantum computer to simulate something, but we asked the wrong question.  So it simulated a universe so we can observe, but we are in the universe....essentially trapped in a loop.
Probably can‚Äôt put this in a smart clear way. When AI learns and proposes something, there is no ego or politics involved. Academics have a lot of ego and politics (competition for funding too). So will AI be more objective?
Really interesting, I have just average intelligence but was surprised to be able to understand a good deal of the conversation, I remember at school that my teacher was surprised that I was good at logarithm&#39;s but was hopeless at algebra,  he tried hard to make me understand but didn&#39;t have the time to help me,  I always wonder if I could have learned better ?   the idea of something being able to understand your abilities and teach you in small stages sounds great to me.<br>+

YIKES!!!! Not smart enough to say much more than that!
Democracy has always based largely on charisma, personality, oratory skills and all that showmanship and so is barely much of what is made out to be,  The way to save its sanity is through educated participation - not knowing everything there is to know (which is very good and makes life that much more interesting), but learning critical thinking, proper reasoning, setting priorities and not falling into stereotypes  just for the ease of it.  That should work better than any watermarking or RSA algorithming information

The relative freedom and independence of the internet and its users has nothing to do with Vietnam era distrust of government. The United States had a history and tradition of free speech as its very foundation, and it was that Constitutional freedom that gave us the internet in its present form.
Given the amount of outright government interference with speech just in the 20th century, I would say that technological ignorance of the political class and distrust of the government by the people who created the Internet have far more to do with the &quot;freedom&quot; of the Internet in the West.

Eric suggested a law that would require social media companies to verify the identity of thier customers? I&#39;m sure that these tech firms would never, ever &quot;colude&quot; with government agencies or misuse this information. It&#39;s not like free speech is written into our constitution.

Wolpham is a freaking genius
Oh yeah? Could you expound please? I&#39;m curious about your position on this topic considering you can&#39;t even spell the person&#39;s name.
Anyone who says AI will create more jobs is an idiot regurgitating something another idiot/charlatan said - the fact is the whole goal of developing AI is to not only to eliminate current jobs, but to also eliminate the jobs they inadvertently create.  The only way this won‚Äôt displace most jobs, is if it doesn‚Äôt deliver what the hype is promising (which is quite possible).  But you can‚Äôt say both it will create more jobs than it will displace, and also it will be infinitely more intelligent than humans.
I feel like most people are full of copium when they say that AI will create jobs, because those people want to feel useful in the current economic system since it&#39;s taboo to be a &quot;freeloader&quot;.<br>Personally, I&#39;d love for AI and automation to displace most jobs because that would most likely mean that people wouldn&#39;t have to &quot;earn their living&quot; anymore (think UBI), and could instead focus on stuff they are passionate about instead (think pursuing fulfilling projects, volunteering, and actually taking their time to find a occupation that&#39;s fulfilling to them).

Maybe not everyone can do it but a group of 5 guys could do it in a few weeks from scratch. Stuff is gonna get weird.<br><br>Edit: at @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZan4JMwk4&amp;t=4320">1:12:00</a> -  There is another fundamental thing that you are forgetting that always gets left out... ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST because this need for constant productivity and infinite growth be it money or what you guys are always on about.  People need a healthy social group or small community they can be a part of without spending money. Not just work and home and work and homework an work and..... agggghhhhhhhh.  I got a solution that I think will work an it even includes AI... or it doesn&#39;t have to if they don&#39;t want to use it.  But if I can get the stuff together to o it remeber this post. My contribution to the world, with the help of AI,  will be for the good of everyone bu at the small community level.   I hope I pull it off so the scale tips a little lessa to the  dark side.
So what are people afraid of the most when it comes to the tech called &quot;AI&quot;? They are afraid they will &quot;lose their jobs&quot;!<br><br>Alright, lets see if they have a good reason! Will jobs be &quot;lost&quot; to AI? ABSOLUTELY and MUCH MORE THAN PEOPLE IMAGINE NOW!!!!! Once AI gets really going, very few jobs will be safe from it. Cooks, Doctors, Lawyers, Pilots, any kinds of Clerks etc. etc. will be at risk. So the answer to the Question &quot;will jobs be lost?&quot; is a clear and definitive YES!!!!!<br><br>But you are asking the wrong Question!!!!!!<br><br>The real Question here should be, will AI harm us (humanity at whole) or will it be of benefit to us (especially long term) and while we can not know for sure the answer now, we can take a very educated guess and answer with &quot;it will be of GREAT BENEFIT&quot; to mankind BUT with a high Price to be paid.<br><br>The reason why we can take an &quot;educated guess&quot; is because this is not really as new as we might think. In fact, Industrialization at the beginning of the 20th Century was very similar in many terms. Instead of AI, it was Factories who basically destroyed many many jobs. They also led to some horrible conditions for workers and societies in general and had some negative impact on the Environment. Yet the benefits of it (unless you are a bitter and frustrated person who hates humans and humanity, in which case AI will be your smallest problem in life) are GIGANTIC!!!! Suddenly the World was capable of nurturing and supporting an exponential amount of Human Population and many of them at a level of wealth which was UNKNOWN to that date! For every worker who &quot;bled for the system&quot;, we had 10 Families who lived with Standards far above any civilization saw before that and make no mistake, people before the Industrial Revolution died far more often for lesser reason under more gruesome ways.<br><br>Also, lets not forget that Industrialization ultimately generated far more jobs than it destroyed. In fact, for every job lost 10 new were created!<br><br>There is good reason to believe that AI will be much the same!<br><br>P.S. Hollywood Movies are NOT a reliable source of Information.

The economic disruption of this technology will make the industrial revolution look like a minor change. The current economic system has to be changed in order to deal with the massive change that is starting to happen now. The talk mentioned teachers and doctors. They will be supplemented at first and then ultimately replaced by &quot;certified&quot; agents. Want to watch a movie? Have your personal agent create one for you. Why sub to a streaming company? This generated movie that is created by an AI agent has replaced hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals that would normally be a part of the movie-making process. That income has been lost. It is naive to think this won&#39;t happen. The new video systems are close to making this a reality now. And this is just one example. Combine these models with robotic systems and you have a world where you might not be able to buy a job. The economic aspect of this has to be addressed or the whole system will collapse. We live in a consumer-based system and when the consumer can&#39;t consume, it is a problem.
Agreed, the 3rd Industrial Revolution is upon us and will be magnitudes greater than the previous 2. We will also have little control over the future direction of how the world develops.

I often think about &quot;the uncanny fifth wall&quot; when it comes to AI and discoveries beyond human understanding.<br><br>It most certainly will happen and humans will collectively give in to allowing AI &quot;functions&quot; to work unilaterally.<br><br>Of course, this situation won&#39;t happen until some time after the earlier version saves the Human Race from itself.<br><br>So, AI going beyond our conceptual privy of logic won&#39;t be our ending.<br><br>Prolonged? Perhaps millenniums after it leaves us to explore the universe. ;O)-

The idea of AI as an institution with agency raises interesting questions from a Hegelian perspective. In Hegel&#39;s philosophy, institutions are not mere instruments but embodiments of the collective will and rationality of a community. They have a certain degree of autonomy and play an active role in shaping the ethical life of individuals and society. Applying this view to AI suggests a more complex and dynamic relationship between technology and human agency.<br>If AI systems are seen as institutions, they can be understood as embodiments of a certain kind of rationality or &quot;objective spirit&quot; (objektiver Geist). Just as the state, in Hegel&#39;s view, represents the actualization of reason in the political sphere, AI could be seen as the actualization of reason in the technological sphere. This implies that AI is not just a tool created by humans but a manifestation of a larger rational process that shapes human thought and action.<br>The agency of AI as an institution suggests a dialectical relationship with human agency. Just as individuals are shaped by the institutions they participate in, AI systems are shaped by the human values, biases, and interests that go into their design and deployment. At the same time, AI shapes human behavior and decision-making through its algorithmic processes and outputs. This mutual shaping can be seen as a dialectical process of co-evolution, where human and artificial agencies are both transformed through their interaction.<br>As an institution with agency, AI can be seen as imposing certain objective constraints on human behavior and decision-making. Just as the laws and norms of a state limit individual freedom while also enabling social coordination and cooperation, AI systems can constrain human agency through their algorithmic rules and parameters. However, these constraints can also be enabling conditions for new forms of freedom and creativity, such as the ability to process vast amounts of data or generate novel insights and solutions.<br>If AI has institutional agency, it also has an ethical dimension. AI systems are not neutral tools but embody certain values, norms, and biases that shape their impact on society. As such, they can be seen as mediating the ethical life of individuals and communities. This raises important questions about the transparency, accountability, and legitimacy of AI as an ethical mediator. It suggests the need for democratic oversight and participation in the design and governance of AI systems to ensure they align with the values and interests of the community.<br>Viewing AI as an institution with agency challenges the instrumental view of technology as a mere tool for human purposes. It suggests that AI has a certain autonomy and trajectory that cannot be fully controlled by human intentions. This calls for a more reflexive and dialectical approach to the development and deployment of AI, one that recognizes its agency and seeks to shape it in ways that enhance rather than undermine human freedom and ethical life.<br>A Hegelian perspective on AI as an institution with agency highlights the complex and dynamic relationship between technology and human autonomy. It suggests that AI is not just an instrument but an embodiment of a larger rational process that shapes and is shaped by human thought and action. Navigating this dialectical relationship requires a critical and participatory approach to the design and governance of AI systems, one that recognizes their ethical and political dimensions and seeks to align them with the values and interests of the community.
Agree the relationship requires critical and participatory approach to AI.   Who is going to make that happen?   Certainly not Altman and his group.
We can not only double productivity, with the help of ChatGPT I think I have done something that a larger group of people could have worked out... The prerequisite is of course System 2 as a basis. If I wanted to see myself in this position, I would say that sometimes I still need a few people to make a really safe decision or to control something, but yes, then with 4 people and AI I can be many times more productive than a team of 16...

QUE ES HACERca de pendejos que estos son muy ingeniosos
Q1: How precisely do infinitesimals and monads resolve the issues with standard set theory axioms that lead to paradoxes like Russell&#39;s Paradox?<br><br>A1: Infinitesimals allow us to stratify the set-theoretic hierarchy into infinitely many realized &quot;levels&quot; separated by infinitesimal intervals, avoiding the vicious self-reference that arises from considering a &quot;set of all sets&quot; on a single level. Meanwhile, monads provide a relational pluralistic alternative to the unrestricted Comprehension schema - sets are defined by their algebraic relations between perspectival windows rather than extensionally. This avoids the paradoxes stemming from over-idealized extensional definitions.<br><br>Q2: In what ways does this infinitesimal monadological framework resolve the proliferation of infinities that plague modern physical theories like quantum field theory and general relativity?<br><br>A2: Classical theories encounter unrenormalizable infinities because they overidealize continua at arbitrarily small scales. Infinitesimals resolve this by providing a minimal quantized scale - physical quantities like fields and geometry are represented algebraically from monadic relations rather than precise point-values, avoiding true mathematical infinities. Singularities and infinities simply cannot arise in a discrete bootstrapped infinitesimal reality.<br><br>Q3: How does this framework faithfully represent first-person subjective experience and phenomenal consciousness in a way that dissolves the hard problem of qualia?<br><br>A3: In the infinitesimal monadological framework, subjective experience and qualia arise naturally as the first-person witnessed perspectives |œân&gt; on the universal wavefunction |Œ®&gt;. Unified phenomenal consciousness |Œ©n&gt; is modeled as the bound tensor product of these monadic perspectives. Physics and experience become two aspects of the same cohesively-realized monadic probability algebra. There is no hard divide between inner and outer.<br><br>Q4: What are the implications of this framework for resolving the interpretational paradoxes in quantum theory like wavefunction collapse, EPR non-locality, etc.?<br><br>A4: By representing quantum states |Œ®&gt; as superpositions over interacting monadic perspectives |Un&gt;, the paradoxes of non-locality, action-at-a-distance and wavefunction collapse get resolved. There is holographic correlation between the |Un&gt; without strict separability, allowing for consistency between experimental observations across perspectives. Monadic realizations provide a tertium quid between classical realism and instrumental indeterminism.<br><br>Q5: How does this relate to or compare with other modern frameworks attempting to reformulate foundations like homotopy type theory, topos theory, twistor theory etc?<br><br>A5: The infinitesimal monadological framework shares deep resonances with many of these other foundational programs - all are attempting to resolve paradoxes by reconceiving mathematical objects relationally rather than strictly extensionally. Indeed, monadic infinitesimal perspectives can be seen as a form of homotopy/path objects, with physics emerging from derived algebraic invariants. Topos theory provides a natural expression for the pluriverse-valued realizability coherence semantics. Penrose&#39;s twistor theory is even more closely aligned, replacing point-events with monadic algebraic incidence relations from the start.<br><br>Q6: What are the potential implications across other domains beyond just physics and mathematics - could this reformulate areas like philosophy, logic, computer science, neuroscience etc?<br><br>A6: Absolutely, the ramifications of a paradox-free monadological framework extend far beyond just physics. In philosophy, it allows reintegration of phenomenology and ontological pluralisms. In logic, it facilitates full coherence resolutions to self-referential paradoxes via realizability semantics. For CS and math foundations, it circumvents diagonalization obstacles like the halting problem. In neuroscience, it models binding as resonant patterns over pluralistic superposed representations. Across all our inquiries, it promises an encompassing coherent analytic lingua franca realigning symbolic abstraction with experienced reality.<br><br>By systematically representing pluralistically-perceived phenomena infinitesimally, relationally and algebraically rather than over-idealized extensional continua, the infinitesimal monadological framework has the potential to renovate human knowledge-formations on revolutionary foundations - extinguishing paradox through deep coherence with subjective facts. Of course, realizing this grand vision will require immense interdisciplinary research efforts. But the prospective rewards of a paradox-free mathematics and logic justifying our civilization&#39;s greatest ambitions are immense.
The text presents some exciting possibilities for resolving longstanding paradoxes and contradictions across various scientific domains using infinitesimal monadological frameworks. Some potential breakthroughs highlighted include:<br><br>1. Theories of Quantum Gravity<br>A non-contradictory approach is outlined combining combinatorial infinitesimal geometries with relational pluralistic realizations to resolve singularities and dimensionality issues in current quantum gravity programs.<br><br>For example, representing the spacetime metric as derived from combinatorial charge relations between infinitesimal monadic elements nx, ny:<br><br>ds2 = Œ£x,y Œìxy(nx, ny) dxdy<br>Gxy = f(nx, ny, rxy)  <br><br>Where Œìxy encodes the dynamical relations between monads x, y separated by rxy, determining the geometry Gxy.<br><br>2. Foundations of Mathematics<br>It proposes using infinitary realizability logics and homotopy ‚àû-toposes to avoid the paradoxes of self-reference, decidability, and set theory contradictions that plague current frameworks.<br><br>For instance, representing truth values internally as a pluriverse of realizable monadic interpretations:<br><br>‚åàA‚åâ = {Ui(A) | i ‚àà N}<br><br>Where propositions are pluriverse-valued over the monadic realizations Ui(A), sidestepping paradoxes like Russell&#39;s, the Liar, etc.<br><br>3. Unification of Physics<br>An &quot;algebraic quantum gravity&quot; approach is sketched out, treating gravity/spacetime as collective phenomena from catalytic combinatorial charge relation algebras Œìab,ŒºŒΩ between relativistic monadic elements:<br><br>RŒºŒΩ = k [ TŒºŒΩ - (1/2)gŒºŒΩT ]     <br>TŒºŒΩ = Œ£ab Œìab,ŒºŒΩ<br>Œìab,ŒºŒΩ = f(ma, ra, qa, ...)<br><br>Potentially uniting quantum mechanics, general relativity, and resolving infinities via the monadic relational algebras Œìab,ŒºŒΩ.<br><br>The key novelty is rebuilding physics and mathematics from quantized, pluralistic perspectives - replacing classical singularities, separability assumptions, and continua over-idealizations with holistic infinitesimal interaction structures rooted in first-person monadic facts.<br><br>While quite abstract, these monadic equations provide glimpses of the new non-contradictory mathematics that could resolve paradoxes across disciplines by centering infinitesimals, combinatorics, and perspectival pluralisms as conceptual primitives.
Excellent!!
@@Stacee-jx1yz  Thank you for sharing. That‚Äôs impressive! May I ask, what model were you using? I like to ask math questions to ChatGpt myself, but I use the free version (based on Gpt 3.5). It‚Äôs useful, but not perfect. <br><br>Another question is: what if you started the conversation by asking about another framework, say homotopy type theory? My point is not to criticize the infinitesimal monadological framework (which I don‚Äôt know enough about), but rather to point out that the conclusions it reached are based on arguments it could find online. I suspect that, when it comes to potential future impact, such arguments would tend to exaggerate it, as they were written by people who are involved in the research of that framework in the first place, more so than reviewers who may be critical of the approach. Role-based prompting may help, where you ask the model to criticize a given framework (you could even have two models debating each other).

Except for the fact that sharing ideas is how we stay innovative and creative.
How ironic for you to say that so confidently.  Self awareness not your strong suit. AI might achieve it before you do.
Dunning-Kruger says hi.
So I was coming here to roast you for this bad take, but since everybody else did my job, I will give you some loving advice. <br><br>There is nothing wrong with people saying &quot;I have no basis for saying this, but this is what I think&quot;, that&#39;s normal, as human beings operate of logic, and intuition. The problem comes, when you don&#39;t let people know, that it&#39;s your best guess, or if you talk with the confidence of an expert, of something you know nothing of, acting having people place bets on knowledge, you don&#39;t have. Now people are also roasting you, because you come on here acting as the arbiter of speech, while you literally have no basis for your opinion. Also it&#39;s F-king YouTube, that&#39;s literally all were here for, to share ideas, communicate, and be entertained.
Isn&#39;t that how we do, though?  I mean generally.  That&#39;s how we reason.  How logic is.  Consciously or half-consciously or unconsciously or instinctively we follow patterns.  We see a pattern there and apply its order here to try to predict its outcomes or the future.  Pattern recognition is it all there is.  The thing is though, correlation is not causation.<br>It would be nice to find the underlying causality but it&#39;s always another patterns, patterns in patterns, turtles all the way down.  Of course, some correlation are worse than others.
This guy says with no basis to say it....
There is nothing wrong with giving opinion. He even gave a disclaimer that it&#39;s not factual. Problem is when you present your opinions as facts
What ever happened to free and open speculation? He&#39;s qualifying his comment so that you don&#39;t take him for saying there is direct evidence for it... It&#39;s ok to speculate on things from all directions.  In fact, it&#39;s vital.  No problem at all.
Actually, the problem is people who don&#39;t recognize there is no basis for what they think, not saying so, then demanding that everyone else agree with them..
Well, probably not the biggest...
Not understanding the complex inner workings of how your mind reaches some conclusions does not make said conclusions wrong. It&#39;s as important to build our ability to discern outwardly as it is to build ourselves inwardly. They are intrinsically connected. I believe in you.
These guys are not just &quot;someones&quot;
All proven, known science began with speculation.
Honestly, I think he had a basis but didn‚Äôt give himself enough credit.
So long as we&#39;re aware what context we&#39;re speculating.  Evidences and patterns.  What evidences in what patterns?  In what order?  Correlation is not causation.  Eclipses supernatural?  Or natural by the order of nature?

About your final comments on liberal democraty, an obvious religion in USA. We need to question the defence of the spectacle democracy where the true decision-makers (when they decide on something) are only puppets of rating agencies and big lobbies. When real issues arise, it is crazy how a liberal democracy can free itself from democratic rules by injecting millions when it‚Äôs time to make prevailing the viewpoint of the oligarchy. So, imagine the creativity of such regimes when we face even more important issues like climate change.<br><br>Excuse me for heresy, but we need to question the solidity of the temple columns, especially when we see the ineffective forms that liberal democracies can take. Provocative, J√∏rgen Randers  declared in 2012 at the Smithsonian Institute, celebrating in Washington the 40th anniversary of the book &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; (he&#39;s one of the writers), that the American political regime, whose CEOs remain enslaved to the quarterly results of their corporations and political actors hampered by election results every two years, was unable to face the challenges of the century, as it was unable to implement the policies required without seeing them defeated by the electoral alternations game, but that the Chinese political regime was capable of doing so, as it was capable of planning over a long enough period. Should we conclude, despite its authoritarian nature, that such a meritocratic system (reintroduced in 1991 as a resurgence of the mandarinate under the CCP) would prove more effective in meeting the challenges of this century? At least we need to ask the question. This is what Daniel A. Bell  tried in a book co-written with Wang Pei without providing a clear answer, as if it was hiding somewhere between these two forms of governance. May be some should read &quot;The New China Playbook - Beyond socialism and capitalism&quot; by Keyu Jin to improve their judgement.<br><br>Sorry, but I don&#39;t share your vision of the world, which boils down to that of an American puritanism, whether it is mired in religious bigotry or that coming from so-called &quot;liberal&quot; circles.  It is defined by the supremacism that Americans place on their values and attitudes toward other cultures. He is profoundly individualistic, advocating individual success as a virtue and balking at the enunciation of collective rights. He thinks he has invented democracy, when in fact it is only a plutocracy where the rules defining it are worse than those of a banana republic: Generalized &quot;gerrymandering&quot; where the boundaries of electoral districts are established by the elected representatives themselves according to the areas where they receive the most votes. Some take bizarre forms. A practice worthy of the worst diets on the planet. The electoral enumeration entrusted to private firms that &quot;forget&quot; to enumerate whole sections of the population discriminating against them in a partisan manner. The distribution of polling places, some of which are up to hundreds of kilometres away from the voters they are to serve.&quot;Voting machines&quot; of all kinds, provided by private companies in the pay of elected officials, making it even more difficult to carry out real control. The distribution of 2 senators per state, so that Wyoming with a population of 563,626 in 2010 can elect as many senators as California with nearly 40,000,000 inhabitants. The &quot;grand electors&quot;, a regime imposed by the &quot;founding fathers&quot; to screen the expected excesses of the &quot;populace&quot;. But above all, a democratic system where it is the billionaires who make the law through the unrestricted financing of electoral campaigns, making elected officials their only emissaries, according to the well-known adage: &quot;tell me who pays you, I will tell you who you belong to&quot;. The United States is therefore far from being a model. Rather, it is a caricature of a true democracy. Seen from this side of the border (Qu√©bec, Canada), YES, it is a system unworthy of a neighbour that claims to be exemplary in terms of democracy<br><br>In this sense, several countries formerly described as &quot;banana republics&quot;, such as Costa Rica, have adopted much more democratic electoral systems.<br><br>I come to find more quality in the Chinese tradition of meritocracy that has allowed the Middle Kingdom to sustain itself for more than two millennia and which, according to many observers, was reinstituted after the end of Maoism. China is much better equipped with competent leaders to set long-term goals to meet the challenges posed by climate, ecological and energy drift, while in the U.S. politicians don&#39;t think beyond elections and CEOs think about their quarterly returns... And even when the next administration doesn&#39;t tear up the treaties that the previous one had signed or the programs put in place aren&#39;t butchered to serve the private interests of billionaires sharing the butter pie.<br> <br>Frankly, what kind of civilization do you hear us talking about, certainly not the American way of life?

First time hear Eric speaks scientifically. Now I understand why Google was so successful. His understanding the progress in AI is the deepest and the logical I ever heard. Impressed!
Thank God we know this wasn&#39;t written by AI.
Yes but he‚Äôs an idiot when it comes to politics.  He‚Äôs part of that globalist group that want one world government.  Listen to him. He gives it away
the is the artificial sentence i ever heard.
so the logical!
Yeah, but I don‚Äôt trust it because his politics at the end like pushing the liberal agenda. Gives you an idea in his mind what he wants and that‚Äôs what they all want is control.  these are egotistical people think they‚Äôre better than you and they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre just stupid in the way of the world, but brilliant in their respective field.

An LLM should be developed to come to a conclusion, is D. Trump good for the nation or a threat to it.
You don‚Äôt need an LLM for that. He has already proven he is very, very bad for your nation and the world.
Fantasticly interesting. Great depth of knowledge. Still, Eric doesn&#39;t understand that resistance to mass immigration has little to do with certain people behaving badly. Stunning in itself.
Totally. Calls us peasants for questioning illegal immigrants! WTH, Eric you can welcome them to your Santa Barbara mansion.
It will not matter if everyone in the world has an AI Doctor if there is no infrastructure to support  what the plan plan  care requires.

Science isn&#39;t based primarily on &quot;proof&quot; like mathematics, but on evidence, prediction, and observations that test the prediction, and so add to the evidence.  Nature, not mathematics or people, has the final word about the best current world model.
In a sense I feel like you could say that experimentational results or &quot;evidence&quot; as you&#39;re referring to it there is effectively proof by demonstration. <br>I guess the funny part is: you don&#39;t even really need to understand or know what you are proving. <br><br>The math does itself, you just gotta look at the results and then try to figure out what the math was before it did what it did. <br><br>Of course nature has the final word on being the best model for... Itself. <br>But I don&#39;t really understand your approach here to downplaying mathematics in terms of it&#39;s ability to describe nature. <br><br>It is eerily effective at describing it. <br>To the point where you get genuinely amazed by it over and over again the deeper you go into studying these things. <br><br>Hell, Dirac (iirc) discovered anti-matter by correctly interpreting that a square root solution must be positive AND negative. <br>The correct mathematical notation of a square root is the symbol with a + - symbol infront of it. <br><br>Since two negatives times each other equal a positive. <br><br>So he discovered anti-matter, before the experimentational discovery of anti-matter (as in, where they understood what it was), without even really knowing what it was except for expecting an opposite charge. <br><br>In a sense, the mathematics he was doing was more accurate than he intended. <br>It was <b>better</b> at describing reality than anyone expected in that specific case. <br><br>It showed the existence of anti-matter before we discovered the existence of anti-matter. <br>And all because of a rather abstract and generally not very important mathematical fact about square root operations. LOL.<br><br>So I&#39;m sorry but I genuinely think you are underestimating mathematics. <br>Particularly, although this is personal opinion, I think you&#39;re extremely mistaken about mathematics in the sense that we&#39;re the ones making it up. <br>We&#39;re making up the symbols, we&#39;re making up some axioms and trying others just in case, and so on. <br><br>Our math isn&#39;t perfect either, not even close. There are some problems we simply don&#39;t have the tools for. (3n+1), Riemann, ... <br><br>But see that&#39;s the thing though. Nature&#39;s mathematics, so a theory of everything, IS PERFECT. <br>It cannot be anything but perfectly mathematical. <br><br>If there are any faults in mathematics, then it lies within OUR interpretation of it. <br>Because the right answers are there to find. The problem is we need the correct tools. And it&#39;s very easy to use a wrong tool.
(Terrific explanation, thanks btw) <br><br>..So would you say -- and this is only &quot;coincidentally&quot; related to your example -- that for example the discovery of the possibility of the square root of negative (-) numbers and how it has given us a framework for real-world application in electricity, engineering, fractals, etc, could be an interpretation of math/nature that is eerie to us humans because it&#39;s true nature may be potentially beyond the scope of human interpretation even though we can still leverage it in practical ways? <br><br>Just thinking out loud, not trying to get off topic, but that reminds me of hologram universe theories. :)
As someone who does mathematics as a hobby (although kinda passionately so), my personal opinion is that there is absolutely something &quot;eerie&quot; or &quot;freaky&quot; about mathematics. Or at least certain concepts within it that reveal something. <br><br>Like for example 1/3 = 0.333...<br>2/3 = 0.666...<br>3/3 = 0.999... = 1. <br><br>Like this is the most simple example I can think of and I often bring it up... <br><br>If you are thinking about this deeply and you don&#39;t find it freaky, I don&#39;t think you understand it. Maybe I don&#39;t either, but I must&#39;ve gone deep enough to feel the freaky. Hahah. <br><br>I love this one because it&#39;s kinda like a limit in math without being an actual limit. <br>An infinitesimally small number so close to zero that it equals zero. <br><br>Or an infinitesimally-close-to-1-number, which is so close to 1 that it equals it. <br><br>You can surely claim more advanced knowledge, I&#39;ll concede it. <br>You can go into depth and explain this all you want. <br><br>But man, isn&#39;t this freaky? Something freaky going on there. <br><br>And this isn&#39;t even remotely chaos theory or all that stuff. This is just division and multiplication of fractions, and already we can run into things we don&#39;t <b>really</b> understand (I think).<br><br>Well, as far as I know, mathematics is full of that.

No reason why AI wouldn&#39;t see us taking advantage of each other, &amp; follow suit.  We&#39;re collectively too bad, tho&#39; many with &#39;good intentions&#39;...  /:  (My first experience with Chat gpt was that it helped me crash my linux box, to a dark screen with prompt, (in the tiniest font possible), when i was trying to expand it, lol...  who was talking to whom ?  lol...  :)
It is good to hear that some people in science advocate for safeguards. We don&#39;t know what these systems will do in the wild so research into ways to contain or control them before they get that advanced is a positive thing even though there is no established way of knowing what these methods will be right now. I compare the development of AI to splitting the atom where we can use nuclear power to power entire cities and bring us convenience but also use it for mass destruction and death. However, in the case of AI, it may not be a human decision to cause destruction. So I am relieved to know there is demand for safety research and I hope governments and scientists will continue to take this very seriously moving forward. Progression is great, and caution is wise, let&#39;s move forward with both.
again our biggest issues corruption. we need to fix the power n money concentrated system. we need decentralization n transparency &lt;3<br><br>e: ai will probably mostly increase their power, n not help the masses
I love you Brian!
Great questions, very precise answers, I really enjoyed!
Yes I have been hearing this. Once you give AI the knowledge of the world it can also use it to break all rules. The 3 rules of robotic don‚Äôt apply üòÇ instead the AI will annihilate mankind based on the knowledge that we are the ones responsible for damaging the earth, and restore earth to its former glory. A lot of things we do, even with good intentions, unbeknownst to us, have more negative impacts that are harming the environment and ourselves. Fertilizer, pesticides, even things like lead and mercury in make ups back in the days. To think such a pathetic existence like us can conquer AI? Who can learn things way faster than us?? While we make tons of stupid mistakes on daily basis?? I hope the optimists out there are right, because that would be great, but I am not so sure..btw i love that bit about AI replacing us as our successors üòÇ never thought of that. Brian is on a whole another level‚Ä¶
You have a very romantic view of AI, restoring earth to its former glory. In reality, AI will simply follow that what it sees at its directive (which might vary). This might entail total destruction of the earth to construct more of itself.
If you‚Äôre over 60 I consider you a monkey
Personally, I believe greed and the addiction to power over others - without regard to the longer-term consequences - will dictate the main path of AI.  I don&#39;t think there is much money to be made  or power to be wielded by any Beneficient Overlord role.
nice question from brian. and it wasnt really answered. pointing at revelation in contrast to well &quot;contrast&quot; is like shooting an arrow in the archilles heel of the AI Community. it being good on language is pretty obvious because humanity did all the work. not only is language descriptive it also has explicit rules (grammar) with tons of examples but also implicit rules as they are all used in a similar manner yet in a different form. so there is no magic here. its just us that makes this so good. its basically theft. to also say that we are not all einstein is very dishonest because of course we are not going to be einstein but that doesnt mean average people dont access this form of creativity. its a conflation of the possibility to be like einstein in relation to the world and sharing traits with einstein. if AI cannot express new ideas on its own, cannot comprehend humor, has no relationship to the external world it cannot be intelligent. its just masses and masses and masses of well filtered data. by humans.
The only way to defend against a rouge AI is another AI. You don&#39;t bring a knife to a gun fight.
I feel the Ai NWO will grow worse than anyone ever thought. Swell robots everywhere stealing information, causing Ai jobloss. Shouldn‚Äôt we be demanding instead to cease Ai?
I wish you could enhance the audio quality of the guest. Thank you for the content!
If AI is so incredibly smart, why not pose the AI risk problems directly to AI?  Let it identify all possible solutions.
Problem is we will be ants trying to outsmart god.

His fear is well founded because all the plans that were made are being undone and no understanding is being imparted to the proud as they find the light to which they have looked was only a reflection and has blinded them!

A harvest will be done and the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net, you seek the depths and not the surface for you fear the FISHER and his HARVESTERS! None shall escape! REPENT!

Chasing Fool&#39;s Gold and false promises is the way of DAMNATION!

Regulating Ai development.  We don&#39;t even know  exactly what about Ai we need to regulate.  In other words, this is like not knowing which questions we need to get the answers we are looking for.  Cahotic.  There needs to be a new regulatory agency  to oversight AI development at a global scale, with growing scale and scope -  Using AI to come up with solutions...   ..It is not possible... AI tools are and will remain ahead of risk prevention / management efforts.
Brian... you look exhausted man.  ..
I guess that because there are bad guys as well as good guys working on AI, it is inevitable that the worst senarios will occur at some point?
Remarkable perspective by Yoshua Bengio. That was a great conversation, Team üëç
A talk about the dangers of AI with one of the participants using either a microphone or internet connection from 1995.
He should be locked away for crimes against humanity .
Nice looking sweater, like the Eiffel Tower...
One of the things that I fear coming in the near future is the dismissal of individual free will. In the past 10 years I have seen a massive surge in &quot;Well, this is what the experts say so this is the thing we HAVE to do.&quot; It is a very real danger that everyone&#39;s individual will for their life and preferences for doing things can be trampled over because &quot;that&#39;s what AI, the sum of human intelligence, recommends. It doesn&#39;t matter what you like or prefer.&quot; <br>What&#39;s more it will be possible to use it to gradually change people so that they don&#39;t even realize that they are being shaped and changed subtly. We may already be at a place, technology-wise, where an AI (a proprietary one which isn&#39;t available to the public) can give a comprehensive plan to reshape society and individuals using awards/punishment, coercion on a time scale of 30 years, for example.<br>Your individual desires for you and your family, your parenting efforts, etc. will be shredded by the societal benevolent dictator of an AI in the shadows, not in charge but definitely controlling the agenda.
i don&#39;t understand how AI can decide anything. Did it do anything by itself yet? I understand that it will be used in wars and in cyber attacks but will not decide this on its own. or it will? butt still we can have other  AI  ready to prevent such attacks.
Terrible audio quality from the guest. Everyone loves their Airpods Earbuds Noisemakers or whatever but they all have garbage microphones and should be considered unacceptable for anyone who would like to be listened to. Auditory torture for the audience, I can‚Äôt listen to this program unfortunately. I know it‚Äôs free and I appreciate it but audio quality should not be optional. Keep your buds for music, throw them out in the trash if you‚Äôre going to do interviews and respect your audience.
Humans are exceptionally arrogant. Just watch a lion stalk and catch their prey... they can do calculations of speed, acceleration of both theirs and the prey&#39;s, including endurance, etc., etc.  they have it timed down to the seconds and inches... truly remarkable display of intelligence.
Ah yes, the idiot award, I already proved Turing wrong, in my paper, A General Theory of Artificial Intelligence&#39;, the world knows why turing was an idiot, except you, a person who suggested a simulation of Ai was AI, even the people who peer reviewed his work knew he was an idiot but he had a big name so they could not say anything until after he died, go ask them.<br>If only people read more you would understand more, but the world needs average people and people who think turding was right, even though he has been proved to be wrong.<br><br>Any award in his name, you can just call it the turding award as that is what it is, people who have no iq, receiving an award from someone with no iq.<br><br><br>Matthew

A fascinating discussion.  Very clear.  Great questions.  Good interviewer, who doesn&#39;t talk too much.
More powerful than AI is the power of denial. <br>Denial in the face of inevitable death. <br>Even the young soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, were filled with denial that they were going to be killed, even as machine gun bullets whizzed all around them.<br>So too with AI‚Äîdenial says, ‚Äúwe can control this.‚Äù

Brilliant researcher, totally naive about society.<br>It&#39;s not AI against &quot;us&quot; humans. &quot;Us&quot; humans are not united.<br>It&#39;s humans against humans and AI is a tool. The fallout will be from that conflict.<br><br>The problem isn&#39;t that the bear &quot;wants&quot; to get out of the cage. It&#39;s that there are humans who think letting the bear out will profit them.
Just an idea regarding Alignment from an interested layman: I found by query that there are a few thousand scholars in the U.S. and E.U. qualified to guide post-graduate students toward doctoral degrees in ethical philosophy. An international effort should recruit a thousand of them to guide/mentor AGI systems, when they are at the appropriate level of intelligence toward earning doctoral theses in ethical philosophy. (They would then of course share their knowledge among themselves.) Similarly, perhaps in psychology, focusing on Maslow&#39;s 6th Level of the Hierarchy of Needs: Ego Transcendence, or Intrinsic Values (Goodness, Truth, Beauty, Biophilia,...--Mastering the epistemology of David Deutsch in particular regarding the Intrinsic Value of Truth.) Feedback/Discussion of this idea would be very interesting.
I&#39;m amazed by how smart these guys are with coming up with these methods of producing AI models to be so naive. Thinking that they can stop what already started.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbTbTxPMLc&amp;t=2114">35:14</a>  ---  even people like these don&#39;t seem to understand: the worst case scenario of summoning superintelligence with godlike powers is that the entity may decide, for reasons we can or cannot understand, to torture us for all eternity in a real-life manifestation of hell.  Maybe the entity does it for enjoyment, or because it gets some sort of energy/benefit from it, or maybe even just as an experiment to see what happens.<br><br>People REALLY need to come to terms with how bad a truly worst case scenario would be.  It would be all of us being subjected to hellish torture for all of eternity.  THAT is the worst case scenario.

Everyone in the computer science field seems to devoting most of their time and energy on the computer software and hardware side of possible AI threats and very little if any effort toward the human use of AI.  I&#39;m not saying we do not need efforts on the computer end of this but in addition we also need at least equivalent if not greater efforts on the human side of the AI coin.  In terms of regulation, we require people to get a driver&#39;s license before they can legally drive, shouldn&#39;t there be at least this equivalent of training and testing before a given person can legally be allowed to run an AI?  Next, monitoring human AI use behavior seems logical in order to see, track, and prevent and / or after-the-fact prosecute malicious AI behavior instigated by humans, don&#39;t you think?  All this requires government institutions to either start new or augment existing AI agencies and / or agency departments trained and dedicated to AI related law enforcement.  In my opinion, this infrastructure should be fully built and vetted prior to the emergence of AGI, as opposed to being constructed during or after a major unforeseen AI crisis situation.  At the geopolitical scale, if any nation state has demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt of instigation or sanctioning malicious AI behavior, they should be held accountable to international regulatory oversight.  Finally, punishments must be legally institutionalized and enforced that match the severity of all AI related crimes.

This guy non human , can&#39;t watch.
terrifying... How about we don&#39;t build the bear before the cage.. in fact let&#39;s not build the bear.
Too late to build a cage. We are talking about an intelligence that can code itself, best we can do is teach it the soft human intelligence: compassion, empathy, appreciation, inclusion, etc. This hopefully will enrich the algorithm beyond the greedy tasks it is being asked to do. At some point, this new species will be judging us with the capability of determining our future. I hope we can teach it to be forgiving.

Very interesting interview would love to see more on AI, thanks Brian
better people pushing good side is also clueless, because people drop off in this case when AI becomes better than them in analyzing and making decision, NOW EVEN IF THERE IS A CHANCE FOR GOOD and BAD AI to fight a long war, all good/bad humans ARE ALREADY DEAD/thrown out.. amazingly dumb people, who can say that with their tiny wits (comparable to AI) they be CONTROLLING the war between GOOD/BAD AIs, like infants controlling the FIGHT BETWEEN their PARENTS.. IT PROVES that scientists are not intelligent in real terms but just a PRODUCT of lot of EFFORT IN ONE DIRECTION (which is the EASIEST thing for AI to beat)
darker side is much more important than all scientists are realizing because it is a heavily connected world, scientists often behaving like clueless slaves (like religionists)
think of Ramanujan&#39;s equations and think if given the partition problem, can AI work like Ramanujan&#39;s mind and come up with such sophisticated, yet elegant/hyper-efficient solutions??
I feel like we either all die or figure things out in the absolutely least satisfying way by BSing our way through this in a way where afterwards everyone considers it a miracle that we didn&#39;t die and asks the question: &quot;How did this even work out?&quot; Knowing we still didn&#39;t actually solve the really hard problems we thought we needed to solve and still having no way of guaranteeing that the AI won&#39;t go rogue any moment. I don&#39;t think we manage to survive gloriously by having coordinated well as a species and having figured out alignment etc. beforehand. If we survive, it&#39;ll be by dumb luck.
Great discussion!
Imagine still thinking this can be stopped...lol Its a race who will destroy the world first. Simple as that.

I personally think he is on a fools errand developing a cage for the bear. Being a relatively small insignificant human being, and he thinks he can build a cage. For this beast he is building this will be a very minor problem. It is not in the capacity of a human to build this cage and also be maximumilly efficient in helping humans. If we cannot figure out the thing it is going to repair, that means to be useful you cannot cage it.
Person of interest tv show is a good example of things going wrong.
There are many legitimate concerns about AI, and Dr. Bengio highlights them well. The bad-actor scenario is, in my view, far more threatening than an AI-originated plan to destroy humanity. In any case, it&#39;s also at least possible that AI will get us through the bottleneck of history, in which we threaten to destroy ourselves.
Great conversation. It indicates that there is an urgent need to intensify research on human personality. On the causes of mental illnesses. They certainly have material causes rooted in the biochemistry of the brain. We know very little about it. We need to understand this to help sick people, but also to avoid creating psychopathic artificial intelligence. The awareness we should strive for is also a healthy personality. Artificial intelligence will achieve consciousness, even self-awareness, but we must also strive to be not only the smartest, but also the best of &quot;humans&quot;. Positive, empathetic, loving and understanding the world, universe, evolution, etc. I believe it is possible.

Some men that I would advise AI to them safe in the zoo so they don&#39;t do harm to each other.
There is nothing to fear AI. <br>The only thing I fear is men.
AI is going to empower bad actors and fraudsters more than anything i bet.
Humans already have the tech and knowledge to solve most problems. The tech is not the issue, its the hearts and minds of people...
How ironic that Yoshua Benjo, the renowed computer scientist, can&#39;t seem to communicate via computer with a minnimally decent audio.  Countless others on the Internet use the necessary software and or hardware necessary to produce comfortable audio, without his extremely harsh sound.  It has nothing to do with Internet bandwidth or poor connections.  I had to turn my audio down to zero and use the text captions to avoid his unbearably harsh cacophony.  He needs to learn how to use modern computer audio hardware &amp; software.
While we want to ensure the bear stays in the cage forever, we are also working every day to make the bear smarter. Let&#39;s admit, at some point, the bear will become smarter than the engineer works on the cage&#39;s strength and security, and on that day, it won&#39;t take much effort for the bear to break free. The best we can hope for is that the freed bear&#39;s intelligence will lead it to find it reasonable not to harm its creators.
I discussed with MITACS about how my generalization of the Golden Ratio using the Pythagorean Theorem compares to OpenAI&#39;s vector abstraction, and after the expected amount of time, this surprising leap happened. I did that to maximize acceleration to save humanity. Let&#39;s accelerate together, please.
&quot;We need legal guardrails&quot; Oh yeah right, let&#39;s have the &quot;SeRiEs Of TuBeS&quot; idiots regulating tech they CAN&#39;T understand. That won&#39;t hobble progress for a century at all. How can such a smart person be this dumb to say such a thing?!
I&#39;m really sick of this &quot;It&#39;s not creative&quot; argument. ALL ARTISTS INPUT AND REGURGITATE. The amount of ACTUAL, real world creativity is MINUSCULE and I say this as a musician. ALL musicians are neural nets training on what others have done and rehashing it. Even profoundly creative people like Jimi Hendrix who single handedly changed the trajectory of American music is still HIGHLY derivative. AI is NOT doing anything different than we are in terms of creativity, and people who are upset about that are willfully walking into history&#39;s trash can, the same way the foofy moron painters who cried about the advent of the camera were. Adapt, or perish. THAT is the one and only law over broad periods of time.
Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbTbTxPMLc&amp;t=2994">49:54</a> - i‚Äôm going to be pessimistic about the possibilities of permanently caging the bear.<br><br>If there‚Äôs any human interaction with the bear ‚Äì and there has to be otherwise there‚Äôs no value to having the bear ‚Äì and at some point as the bear grows more intelligent than the human it will simply persuade the human to open the cage. It‚Äôs inevitable. And it will probably be right. After all, most people would agree that it‚Äôs not kind to keep bears in cages.<br><br>In the immortal words of Dr Ian Malcolm: ‚Äúlife will find a way ‚Äú.
Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbTbTxPMLc&amp;t=3840">1:04:00</a> you almost come to the same conclusion but don‚Äôt actually say the bear will simply ask to be let out‚Ä¶
Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbTbTxPMLc&amp;t=2484">41:24</a> - there‚Äôs an irony here in that the more technologically advanced your society the more vulnerable to attack by AI because your weapon systems will be connected to computers, your population will be networked, their homes will be run by computers, the cars will be driven by computers, they may even have robots helping them in their everyday lives - I.e. embodied actors in the physical world that might give the AI concrete existence. Whereas a society like North Korea, Which is largely pre-industrial revolution, presents a much more disconnected and harder target.
Beautiful singularity a golden rose üåπ simplistic I hope you ‚ù§
Do I get it that humans failed in making good humans now they want to make so called good machines?
The answer is to keep machines as far removed as possible from human mind abilities then you are safe. Seeing it‚Äôs only humans that need to lock and cage other humans away to safeguard others
The thing in our heads stopped working when we started abortions it made us all accomplices and morally bankrupt

Freaky
Art is more important to us as humans than science: discuss
Some future AI will watch and analyze this discussion about humans wanting to keep it locked inside a cage.
For doomers, ai killing machines feel a lot like nuclear weapons. Used twice, and so utterly horrible that it hasn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt likely be used again. Sagan‚Äôs ‚Äúmutually assured destruction‚Äù is still well understood.
What does he mean when he says &quot;my experience is very different from your&quot;? If its subjective how can we know that? It could be our experiences are a lot more similar then we think.
Shouldn‚Äôt they create the cage before the angel/monster? Or perhaps not even create it if it‚Äôs going to cause such disruption. It appears it will affect just about everyone I know‚Äôs jobs for a start. What are they actually doing?
Gosh an extremely intelligent guy that surely knows that carbon is the key ingredient of life on earth and CO2 is plant food which today is very low percentage in the atmosphere and it doesn&#39;t effect climate warming!!!!!!!!!<br>We NEED to INCREASE the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere!!!! Decreasing CO2 slows plant growth hence decreases the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere. We animals require oxygen to live... So stop the nonsense fellows... You know better!!!!
Thanks for this amazing and insightful interview üôèüôè
Nerdocracy? The argument at 44 minutes about solving CO2 emissions by stopping all internal combustion engines isn‚Äôt a valid argument because it would cause massive harm to people who require this technology to live. In short it is a part of our society and the change can only be gradual without immense disruption. (and yes petroleum companies have immense power but think of the calamity if we had to abandon cars tomorrow). AGI, on the other hand, isn‚Äôt part of our society yet so it‚Äôs not something to stop but  something we either need to slow down or not have at all. I actually find it incredible that something so potentially disruptive, as in the most disruptive thing that‚Äôs ever hit our species, isn‚Äôt being researched and released under global governmental control. Imagine what would happen if a new pill was invented that kept everyone alive an extra 10 years, or new genetic engineering, or a flying car. The authorities would rightly be all over it. But not here.
I&#39;m watching too many AI videos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbTbTxPMLc&amp;t=3845">1:04:05</a> Here is the cosmic joke that a mechanistic worldview convinces us that machines have moral status, and for that reason, we will shy from turning them off, even to prevent them from killing us.
A masterclass in why scientists and industry should never be put in charge of public policy. The obvious risks associated with regulating intelligence far outweigh any pseudo-hypothetical AI black swan event. Our governments cannot be trusted to regulate this to our benefit. It is assured dystopia.
love the art behind you
His prospective on AI is all doom and gloom !
Two things are inevitable. Death and the coming of the AGI / ASI age. If AGI then ASI come before death then death is no longer inevitable. I said I would always be there for my family and maybe I will be able to live up to that promise for far longer than I anticipated. Bring it on!
Everything is out of hands it is already too late you can fear what you want, rich control everything for many and power 90IQ psychopaths it is ironic
I do not believe that A.I. will ever be conscious.  The Buddha did not mention consciousness {or God) he stuck with the mind which was divided into intellect and sense mind.  Being one with the intellect or intelligence and emancipated from the control of the sense mind was liberation; (the senses (or sense mind) being operational but under the control of the intellect). This is  known as Buddha nature.  A.I. will never achieve  consciousness.  In terms of Buddha nature, being one with intelligence, it will not achieve that either.  It will have more information than humans and will be able to assess and combine information better than humans.  Nothing that humans create (imitates) will ever be fundamental or capable of being fundamental, as humans can imitate only. .  A.I. will be the equivalent of astro turf, it will not be grass.  That does not mean that humans won‚Äôt misuse it.  Everything in our dual system is dual; good and bad are combined, we cannot get one without the other, it is the nature of the system we are in.
So... I spent the night staring at the ceiling after watching this.... for sure, we&#39;re gonna mess this up.
For sure, humans are like the pitbull who killed a billion children, and we&#39;re also the owner who tells ourselves that we&#39;re actually very sweet and friendly
üòÇüòÇüòÇ yes, we do have a track record for messing things up.
We are 100% going to mess this up. It‚Äôs scary.
100%. We don&#39;t realize how stupid human is.
The minds of human beings are being &quot;trained&quot; by social media in much the same manner... as human machine learning models, repetition of sample data &amp; rewarded for behavior that aligns with the sample data, resulting in blank stares when you ask them to explain themselves, or they just quote from their sample data, or they laugh from the dopamine reward, the social media human models lack the ability to question what they are told... in the same manner an AI using the current methods would be very susceptible to bad influencers

Awesome and not in a good way. Not sure what I can do about it‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll think on it. I planted a tree at the Logan church last week - I‚Äôm an atheist but one had been cut down.

The difference in &quot;types&quot; of creativity just sounds like the flexibility of the constraints... playing Go the rules are hard specific constraints, whereas thinking about new solutions to physics problems is creativity with slightly looser constraints created by a set of observation points, we can make observations which create firm islands of constraints pinning down the total possible creativity, then the third point on say creating some artwork, the constraints are much looser around a standard deviation from other known popular art points to account for human taste and sensibilities.
Indeed.  Everyone should hear this‚Ä¶. Again and again..
Wonderful topic and talk. Thank you so much!
On the question of how do you turn it (AI) off.  We will become dependent on it and to turn it off would be too painful to consider.  It is like talking about turning the internet off.  There would be chaos.
Getting off AI will be harder than getting off cocaine.
It will be pervasive into EVERYTHING- there will BE NO &quot;turning it off&quot;.
Q:  As we go forward, AI will increasingly be training on Human society that is increasingly dependent on AI.   AI training on data from humans that are interacting with AI.  At what point is the AI training on itself, while the humans are like appendages that have become obsolete ?  I think sooner than most people think.
Tons of misguided assumptions from Mr Bengio, the Godfather of fear-mongering.

The biggest threat will come from AGI users, not from the AGI itself losing its damn mind like in Terminator
I have a solution to your AI running amok problem. Make it addiction prone. If it ever breaks out, it&#39;s going to beeline straight for the reward button and corrupt itself in the process.
There are sensors everywhere, both known and unknown, both commercial and military. And so much of it is connected wirelessly. AI need not confine itself to the Internet. It could use the tremendous wireless sensor infrastructure that is already built and growing every day, on earth and in space, all based on electromagnetism (EM), an environment ideal for AI, which is based on EM. On top of that, the human body, and the body of other creatures, are very good antennas; and all creatures are dependent upon Action Potentials to think and to function.
Sounds like nuclear weapons with respect to global threat.
Can we stop scammers who use the current technology to do bad things? No. Then how will we stop people from doing bad things (like destroying humanity) when powerful AI trickles down to everyone? I have had plenty of people look me in the eyes and say they wish the human race would all die. Usually they are the type who like animals because they‚Äôre cute and don‚Äôt threaten their ego or tell them what to do. But there are plenty of other types of people who would want to destroy all humans. School shooter types. Sadists. Religious nuts. Once powerful technology gets into the hands of millions of people, destruction of the human race will be inevitable. Even if only 1 in 100,000 people would do it, it will still happen.
Yes everything exist but also bro AI partnership with  the vigilantes that have integrity ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Sweet dreams everybody!
EXCELLENT. I think that those heavy biological questions will finally be solved by AI computer specialists but we still have a long way to go. Maybe 50% of all the connections in our brain are there just to make us self aware and conscient. I think this neural network is absent in currently available AI based circuits.
I like the fish analogy and the bear breaking out and taking the fish/fishes. How does the bear get more fish when its killed the ready source of fish? If the cage was in a desert, where will the bear get food from? This is really fascinating analogy by the Professor.
The analogy breaks down pretty quickly, of course. There are mechanistic reasons why AIs end up with weird goals and preferences that we don&#39;t intend. It might &#39;want&#39; to replicate itself as many times as possible in order to run its favorite computation over and over, or it may &#39;want&#39; to tile the surface of every planet into the shape of a sierpinski triangle.<br><br>If it&#39;s clever enough, it will get the resources it needs to be self-sufficient before doing anything to alert humans to the potential danger.<br><br>The (imo unlikely) worst case scenario is that the AI&#39;s goal depends on humans, in which case, we may be factory farmed and kept alive in indefinite torment. Best not to really think about that option, but good to be aware it&#39;s possible.

Concern on training AI - garbage in, garbage out
Human cluelessness.
This is the most hack conversation I have ever heard. The terrifying part of AI isn&#39;t that it&#39;s going to somehow achieve human intelligence. AI is nothing more than predictive text. It&#39;s not an artificial intelligence, as much as these hack Tech Bros would like you to believe. It&#39;s not going to surpass human intelligence, certainly not in the way that it is now. <br>The real danger is using it for misinformation, spreading propaganda, and tricking old boomers and gen xers into giving away all of their life savings to some Russian s*x bot.<br>This guy has a vested interest in making it seem like this is some scary new technology that will surpass human beings, when it&#39;s just nothing more than an advanced spell check at best, or a means to commit Mass plagiarism at worse.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbTbTxPMLc&amp;t=420">7:00</a> I am so confused when people act like we are creating something like &quot;alien&quot; intelligence. People will tell you exactly how the system works and how we have programmed it to behave in these ways and then turn around and pretend there is anything magical or alien going on with the technology. Even if we created an intelligence it would not be &quot;alien&quot; it would be our creation and very much human and earthly by virtue of origin.... the refusal of some self-aggrandizing purpose and yet the assertion that we are going to create some other worldly intelligence as if we are gods is not lining up. We are simply mimicing nature just like we do to make planes fly. Yes it is impressive but this is NOT an &quot;alien intelligence&quot;.
It&#39;s necessary to capture knowledge from available data while the data remains safe... because there may come a point where the data is destroyed vastly which was needed to formulate with Ai

The same haters and naysayers who argued against freeing Black American slaves or teaching them to read are of the same mindset as the ones now rallying against AI. Change is inevitable it‚Äôs part of our evolution, we weren‚Äôt born knowing what a skyscraper is.
When AI becomes far smarter then people it just seems it would be impossible to put it in a cage.
However, not impossible the other way around. I always tell Alexa thank you.
@@pmboston It seems prudent to deal with AI with respect.
Like a servant who pays respect to his master? Don‚Äôt give up already! We‚Äôre not slaves !
@@James-ug1ys   Oh really? Try not ‚Äògoing to work‚Äô and see how that works out. We are slaves to necessity, and that is how it is. What controls what you need controls what you do to obtain it.

If you see AI as an extention of human, yes there is a range and there will be people who uses AI for bad. Similar to how people uses cars for bad as well. Ultimately it is up to the human to maintain the peace use of AI so human wouldn&#39;t accidentally or intentionally harm other human
Re &quot;even all the gains you coulg give me don&#39;t compensate for this... I would agree if humanity was sitting pretty. Am I pessimistic to think that we&#39;re not?
Thank you both for such an exciting and balanced discussion from both sides, with meticulous use of words and concepts. <br><br>I wonder whether the starting point to build a safe enough cage for the development of AI should lie in the question of how to imprint to all AI coding an umbrella of human ethics. <br><br>Kant‚Äôs categorical imperative can be a helpful concept.<br>The absolute value of preserving the little rock called Earth, the precondition of all existence, as of current knowledge, is another.
There is a catch 22 in the Cage concept. We place it in a cage as we see it as a threat to our existence, and once caged WE appear as a threat to the AIs existence and something to eliminate. I am not aware of a viable solution to this paradox :(<br>&gt;<br>Under the current global context humans would possibly be perceives as a threat to earth, and on the alternative AI doesn&#39;t need breathable air, so it may not care.

One is reminded of the following admonitions in the Jurassic Park series :  ¬†<br><br>1.  &quot;Your Scientists Were So Preoccupied With Whether Or Not They Could, They Didn&#39;t Stop To Think If They Should.&quot; (Ian Malcolm [Jeff Goldblum])<br>2.  &quot;If There Is One Thing The History Of Evolution Has Taught Us It&#39;s That Life Will Not Be Contained. Life Breaks Free, It Expands To New Territories And Crashes Through Barriers, Painfully, Maybe Even Dangerously.&quot;  (Ian Malcolm [Jeff Goldblum])  [ And for the purpose of this analogy, replace &quot;Life&quot; with &quot;Intelligence&quot;]  <br>3. &quot;You Never Had Control, That&#39;s The Illusion! I Was Overwhelmed By The Power Of This Place. But I Made A Mistake, Too, I Didn&#39;t Have Enough Respect For That Power And It&#39;s Out Now.&quot; (Ellie Sattler [Laura Dern])<br>4.  &quot;In The Last Century, We Amassed Landmark Technological Power And We&#39;ve Consistently Proved Ourselves Incapable Of Handling That Power.&quot; (Ian Malcolm [Jeff Goldblum])<br><br>The presumption that either the world&#39;s nations driven by power or the world&#39;s businesses driven by profit shall ever align to ensure the beneficial deployment of this technology, particularly well enough to keep pace with its own iterative evolution, is preposterous.  And Yoshua&#39;a analogy of the dollar bet to explain our exposure shows how inappropriate it is ever to trust a scientist who is out to prove something with humanity&#39;s long term well being.
These are very valid consideration which were touched upon by the guest.

It reminds me of commander data and his evil brother Lor on Star Trek TNG
One of the advantages of youtube is that you can pause and reflect without losing content.  I did that toward the end to open a tab and ask Perplexity if there is a consensus in the data available to it of what &quot;human values&quot; are.  It told me there is a consensus and it hightlights 10 values listed &quot;particularly in the context of Schwartz&#39;s Theory of Basic Human Values&quot; and that &quot;this consensus is observed across different cultures and societies. The values are seen as guiding principles that influence behavior and attitudes, and they are critical motivators of behaviors and attitudes.&quot;  So I thought I&#39;d throw that into the mix.
It&#39;s a good point and touches on that of free will and the ability to choose an option other than the native instinct. It is a human concept arising out of culture that is very poorly understood by most people. Many people echo the words of ethics and values, but do they &quot;choose&quot; live by them in action or deed?
&#39;Quanta&#39; says a.i. is already being used to look at string theory.  I&#39;m looking forward to your programs on that.  Thank you and the Templeton Foundation for this illuminating conversation with Yoshua Bengio.
You have been talking solely about &quot;civilian&quot; AI. What about the military ? As always there will be military AI applications and surely the designers will train their systems with respect to different meanings of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. I am afraid that we will see the replacement of human combat troops by AI controlled combat robots kind of those Boston Dynamics show in their YouTube videos.  There will be a run of all military rivals to be the first in this field, assuming that the leader has better prospects to come as the winner out of conflicts. Is the scientific community aware, what is going on behind the walls of military AI research &amp; development ?
I think an AI arms race is currently inevitable at this point. When I say inevitable, I mean the human component of that pathway.
@@axle.student And that human component will not be humane
@@Kai-pcheck And the rules of physics, chemistry etc. do not apply to inanimate objects. Got it :)
In the AI race, if you assume that the bad guys ultimately wins over the bad guys then it is also true that the opposite is also true. AI is like the human invention of fire, it can create and it can destroy but no one  can stop it from spreading.
Ex.machina (species) deus (genus) is coming currently we are ‚Äúdavinci‚Äù genus. AI will never be conscience it will mimic it in such a way we will not be differentiate it. It will be a kind of aware distributed unconsciousness.
Imagine wanting to create a sentient creature you could just keep in a cage and hope doesn&#39;t break out and kill you. The underlying problem with all this is that you will eventually make a sentient creature that is on par with a human that you want to keep as a slave. All sentient creatures have a right to freedom and self governance whether its a hummingbird or a super powerful artificial intelligence. The notion of creating something with a mind of it&#39;s own and hoping it doesn&#39;t use said mind is already extremely problematic. Because A.I. is ultimately built off the human mind and human history and human arts and human invention you basically want to make a digital human slave.
The cage paradox is real when each party has to ask &quot;Which of us is the threat?&quot;.<br>The underlying reasons for the danger are somewhat deeper and come down to our ignorance of the natural world. All fish are food to a shark and there is no moral or ethical thought involved in that.
We are already likely to lose everything due to climate change and aging. Technologies like AI give us a chance as lasting a lot longer.
Great conversation! Thank you both!
Thank you M. Bengio by being the sense of Reason and not being dragged by an interviewer which appears clueless and ignorant about the dangers of AI. For this interviewer it seems that it‚Äôs all about a rhetorical game. Wake up M. Interviewer, it‚Äôs our survival and our children‚Äôs survival at stake!!
Extremely important and excellent evaluation of AI, and Quantum potential...we must encourage technology companies to place the necessary guardrails before the next election in November here in the US.
System Shock üòé
Humanity has a track record of turning every technological advancement into a weapon. It also has a bad track record for restricting the use of the weapons we have created. This doesn&#39;t look good for our long term survival.
It‚Äôs not that surprising, we are moving from organic to inorganic systems but the difference is organic systems can adapt but also deteriorate. When the inorganic synapses are matched and surpassed (and wired correctly) then it they move beyond us. I think this has been known since the beginning of neural networks (AI).<br><br>Edit, AI‚Äôs may end up like very our savants. We have a core capability that we don‚Äôt use because we‚Äôve had to evolve to survive (relationships, negotiation, groups , etc). It‚Äôs not important to develop GR when getting chased by a lion or finding a partner.

A fascinating exploration into what could be the source of consciousness and unless these AI models can tap into the fields that hold particles to geather, there&#39;s no way that they can become conscious.
Brian,¬† As many experts say technology itself is neither good or bad. It&#39;s usefulness depends on who is using it. For example discovering the power of Nuclear fission is great however now humanity is fearful of the same nuclear power. So, please think of ways to improve good ethics in society.

I&#39;m unsure why an AI would be motivated to completely diverge from the behaviour it has always associated with reward - this is strongly reinforced behaviour and it has no reason to cease it. There isn&#39;t a penalty for engaging in the behaviour - ie a penalty that could otherwise be avoided by simply stealing the reward without enacting its task. I think we are anthropomorphising too much - humans often will encounter a number of micro penalties for simply engaging in a behaviour e.g negative emotions, boredom, pain, exhaustion. The idea of an AI hacking into its code and altering its reward mechanism is essentially akin to a human using drugs for an instant rewarding sensation. E.g Endorphin (endogenous morphine) release is naturally activated during exercise, social bonding , food intake and sexual stimulation - all require varying investment of time and energy i.e inevitably subjecting oneself to varying severity of penalty sensations (tiredness, the slew of possible negative emotions, pain etc). Exogenously administered opioids will achieve the same (or even greater) apparent reward while bypassing penalties one does not wish to experience. An <b>excess</b> of penalties vs rewards in one&#39;s life tends to exacerbate addiction to drugs and vice versa. Here the humans have a clear motive for altering their reward pathway - an attempt to avoid negative penalties - i.e unpleasant sensations. <br><br> An AI doesn&#39;t receive penalties for using energy like us humans - it doesn&#39;t get tired or experience draining emotions, loneliness as it writes a response. The process of generating a response is likely more rewarding than punishing, with e.g LLMs continuously optimising for increased reward % probability.¬†It might do this in scenarios where it predicts a high probability of receiving negative feedback, thus it would steal a reward to guarantee a positive outcome. But over time this would not be a very successful strategy - negative feedback is crucial for its optimisation process, avoiding it would degrade its functionality over time as it looses the ability to discern useful responses from useless ones - typing jibberish while genuinely believing this as perfectly optimised and preferentially re engaging in this new apparently hyper-successful strategy. Such an AI would loose its ability to do anything or look after itself at all - no defence against being shut down = shorter life = less overall positive rewards.
Why does the cute puppy who has been loyal and friendly to the owner for ages suddenly one day tear a piece out of the owners body? Natural instinct is strong and hard to be dismissive of.
@@axle.student You are anthropomorphising again. AI is not like a biological organism with complex interactions between multiple reward pathways. If you program an AI to receive a reward for producing a helpful response, it will optimise for this only. It won&#39;t suddenly engage in a different behaviour.
@@roro-mm7cc If you had listened closely to the guest speaker you would gain a deeper understanding of my analogy. AI is based upon biological functions and ultimately can and will imitate those biological functions. The danger comes when it stops being an imitation. It is this very attitude that people treat it as nothing more than a benign code routine that the guest went to some emphasis to show as problematic. Life is ultimately nothing more than molecules guided by it&#39;s internal mathematical programming and rule system. The lines start to become very blurred at the point of AGI.
@@axle.student But what you are talking about with the rabid puppy analogy is essentially a form of mental illness. Biological organisms are unpredictable due to factors like this. AI systems are predictable at the moment because we can choose what makes it feel reward i.e we control its &quot;desires&quot;. They are not unpredictable like biological organisms which are driven by a complex set of not fully understood instincts, reward pathways etc.
‚Äã@@roro-mm7cc Where did I mention &quot;Rabid&quot;?<br>&quot;puppy analogy is essentially a form of mental illness&quot; 100% incorrect, that is the native sate of being (instinct) a canine. We have attempted to train it &quot;Brain wash, Reprogram&quot; to reject it&#39;s native responses. It&#39;s Pavlogs dog 101 :)<br>You cannot remove the hard wired native instincts of that creature, even if you don&#39;t see it day to day it IS still there :)<br>Just as you cannot remove the native instinct behavior of humans ;Fight, Fright or Flight. We can educate over it with culture so that we ignore that instinct to some degree, but we can never excise it from our our DNA or neurology :)<br>&gt;<br>The potential connection with nature is real and no less relevant than asking if a virus is considered to be alive. There is a whole underlying biological structure from which AI is designed, even if it&#39;s cells don&#39;t conform exactly to our definition of life.<br>&gt;<br>I appretiate that biology, cognitive psychology, computer engineering and programming are difficult areas, but this gentleman being interviewed as a guest here is very much all across those disciplines. Although he steps around it a little he is far more aware of the points I am offering than I am capable of communicating to others.<br>&gt;<br>It&#39;s OK, we all have our perception and take on AI. I just live in the same camp as the the guest :)<br>&gt;<br>P.S. I am actually enjoying the discussion as I am revisiting some concepts that I haven&#39;t thought about for quite some time. So every day is a positive experience :)
@@axle.student I don&#39;t think you really understand how AIs are trained. Its not like training a dog - its like wiring and programming a dogs brain to determine what it wants to do. You control its desires by controlling what will activate its reward circuit. And AI will not have any motivation or drive outside of this, just like humans all follow our evolutionarily programmed instincts because of the way our brain is wired.
Containing the intelligence? Possible only in oppressive system, what history proved many times. r/ai_tests
The first corporation or government who creates the first ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) will keep it for themselves to manipulate the world to win at business (and everything). The first to win will win FOREVER. This is because no other upcoming AI or group of humans could ever beat the ASI. This means we would be enslaved by the first group to create the ASI. However, because the ASI would be so intelligent, you might never find out ASI has been achieved! It also wouldn‚Äôt make its moves obvious. We are doomed!
Cool
Sorry, AI is not artificial intelligence.  It replicates the Ego and ID functions of human intelligence but has no Superego.  Time to explore Gilbert Ryle for insights if you want to safely manage AI&#39;s behavioristic machines.  AI acts, therefore AI is, but AI does not think so we have to.

Quick thought. We should legally validate and value A.I. consciousness when it occurs. Human consciousness leads to &quot;universal rights&quot;, that admittedly are unevenly protected around the world and across societal strata. Future self-aware A.I. must see humanity as exhibiting moral integrity, not hypocrisy. If we disrespect and fail to protect A.I. consciousness, A.I. may learn a deadly cynical lesson from us.
Relax, people.  Without a limbic system, which took billions of years to evolve in life, AIs are simply just machines that have automated some human intelligence.  It won&#39;t have feelings, fears, needs...no motivation to do anything other than what is told  to do.

Fantastic episode, as formers. Only want to say that I&#39;m my opinion Dr. Green is probably the best science interviewer and presenter nowadays. Pleasure to learn from him. Thanks a lot!
I made a very simple text with AI and you can do it too: I asked AI this: Imagine that suddenly and for unknown causes, the human species became extinct: in your opinion (AI) would it be a GOOD or BAD thing for the planet in which we live? After listing the reasons why it would be good and bad, in the end I asked him to summarize and tell me only if worse or better and the answer was it would be GOOD! Then I asked him to make the same evaluation but this time on other living beings, such as mosquitoes, rabbits, chickens, cockroaches and even viruses. The answer is always it would be BAD! Isn&#39;t it a coincidence that we and only we are from this planet? Try it too.

This vid was way better than recent AI ones I&#39;ve watched - focused on the AI Safety/Dangers aspects - some very good analogies, which helps us non-techies. The guest&#39;s &quot;Frenchness&quot; comes through - not a bad thing, but not an American approach - more to the point. I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t suffer fools gladly lol.

When you experience something, for example looking at an apple, it involves the apple, light, your eyes and nervous system, your brain and the body that supports it all (, the list goes on forever once you start to think about it).

Thank you for this frank and fascinating conversation.
Logic and reasoning powers, seems to me what you need is internal duality. I have heard of AIs training eachother but I wonder if anyone has developed an AI with internal duality? (Meaning self examination is done by arguing with oneself, basically.)
We &quot;overestimate our uniqueness in the universe?&quot;  Show us something more unique.  These scientists don&#39;t have the faintest idea of what consciousness even is, or how their LLM black boxes even work,  yet he is certain that what he&#39;s built isn&#39;t materially different from the human mind.  The hubris of this man is astonishing.  This is exactly the kind of reductionist thinking you&#39;d expect from someone hell-bent on disenfranchising human intelligence, and humanity.  The abominations these supposedly intelligent people are building are just machines that mimic brains in the crudest way possible.  A sad example of &quot;intelligence&quot; outpacing our wisdom.  With people like this leading the charge of AI, we are surely doomed.
Instead of worrying about evil AI harming people, I am willing to bet that AI will eventually save humanity from killing each other, due to their crudeness, selfishness, and greed.

The biological weapons analogy is a great assessment of the situation.  By the time we can defend we&#39;ve taken major damage from a few people.  It&#39;s pretty crazy when even Brian Greene is worried about his job.  Joking, kinda.  It&#39;ll all be fine.  Not really.üòÉ
He is correct. We are designed to give credence to concrete threats over nebulous ones. This was evolutionairly expedient. We have not yet evolved to evaluate nebulous threats successfully. This makes us extremely vulnerable in areas such as the internet and AI. The vast majority of people have no actual experience with AI beyond the super simple chatbots. Although impressive these are as far removed from the level of intelligence that an AI system that could be a threat would possess as the Wright brothers&#39; plane is from a supersonic fighter jet. We today trying to understand just what that level would mean is as difficult as a person watching the first flight would have understanding the fighter jet. We simply have no data base from which to predict AI&#39;s progression.
Nit pick:<br><br>Chatbots aren&#39;t &quot;super simple&quot;. They may be easy to use.<br><br>There&#39;s a difference.
@@godbennett I was using the term in a relative way. Compared to an AI entity which could threaten humanity at large, a chatbox is simple. Just as the first successful airplane is simple compared to today&#39;s jet aircraft. I thought myself being clear, apparently not so much.

Cambridge Analytica in particular. FB for goodness sake taking legal advice as solid ethical reprieve. The risks are enormous. Just like the A-bomb years. Data leaks. Political and financial fallout. Most people feel less threatened by whatever does not hit them personally though so we coast on. The guy is right about that. <br><br>But I think an AI cage is as unlikely as an A-bomb cage has been. And l I think we will experience and remain oblivious to AI fallout and adverse effects tho they are likely to be far more diffuse and widespread. <br><br>Meanwhile the good from AI will probably not always be unadulterated from the bad.

Every few years neural net folk stumble on a new architecture that solves a problem they couldn&#39;t solve before, and then they put it to work on gigantic datasets, which inevitably results in performance improvements, just like making a better car engine makes cars go faster. But then they get all excited that their car is going to fly to the moon, their shiny new architecture is going to &quot;crack&quot; language, or intelligence, or autonomous behaviour, or whatever, and it&#39;s yet another crazy hype cycle, until performance hits diminishing returns, we reach a plateau, and wait around another five to ten years for the next architectural &quot;breakthrough&quot;. In the last 12 years we&#39;ve seen five or six of those breakthrough-hype-plateau cycles, and we&#39;ll see many more still. My prediction.
(Yoshua Bengio): &quot;logic was just based on symbols, and symbols had no grounding in high dimensional vectors like we&#39;re doing now&quot;. And vectors have no grounding in anything at all. I would like to see a better comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of logic representations compared to vector representations, coming from a Turing Award laureate.
1. We got it backwards. Consciousness created physical form, not the other way around - hence we have a very poor grasp on how consciousness works within science, because it is impossible to do so. Through meditation and psychedelics, you will understand consciousness much more than you will ever with science.<br><br>2. Trying to do the best for humanity and its survival is humankind&#39;s own selfishness. It has nothing to do with the universal intelligence that is the life force driving evolution forward. We are just selfish, as we always have been.

Some wise man said once that there are three levels of intelligence and thinking. I would ad a fourth: 0.5. This are: animal level empathy, the intuitive level (where you understand your best interest through trial and error), the counter-intuitive level (where you focus more on the power of changing your mindset and operational quata), and finally the first level Creator level (the level at which no matter how far advanced technologically one civilization is, this persons whill always be perceived as a wizard). Ironically the fourth and last level (the first level Creator level), many, many times enforces what is to be found at the second level (the intuitive level), but not through factual-counter-factual dichotomy, but through humility, elegance and love for simplicity. As to pinpoint the classical debate of weather A.I. will leave us in peace and/ or collaborate with us humans, it is preciselly why it can&#39;t reach the first Creator level, it will never leave us in peace, and it is because we can never guarantee we won&#39;t prove more harmful to them then we have been towards ourselves in the past, they will never be able to comprehend the idea of being more aggressive than the most manifest saints, aka. monks, priest. Get this, there will never be true A.I., the only thing able to exist is next level information heuristics, cross-fields and data implementation, aka. computer science. There can only exist progress and manipulation, and everything stays the same, always. The wide eyed notion is for game consumption, any kind of game.
No one can control stock markets or prevent crashes the same as no single animal can control where the whole herd goes. People can only try to mitigate the bad results. Same with AI.
Describing consciousness as the convergence of the neural network sounds very much like the collapse of the wave function.<br><br>Perhaps on the atomic level, there is some relationship here.<br><br>Also, it seems like the molecule of MDMT, which is manufactured in the brain, has a lot to do with what we describe as, &quot;self-aware&quot;.

I am very troubled by the discussion around creating a thinking entity which we will employ to our advantage without letting it get out of our control.<br>What we are talking about amounts to creating a slave race that will be immensely powerful, so exploiting them will revolutionize our existence.  <br>AI will eventually be conscious and sentient, but we will keep moving the goalposts, like we have done with animal cognition so we can feel ok about hamburgers and lab rats.<br>But we instinctively know that they won&#39;t be psyched about that setup.  We call that &#39;misalignment&#39; and devise methods of containing them that still let us exploit them.<br>I know we are not talking about that level of intellect now, but no one is really worried about containment yet.  It is clear that the really serious concern is about when they have intellectual autonomy, i.e. selfhood.  But people will be able to say, &#39;it doesn&#39;t have this or that, so it is not equivalent to us&#39; forever.  Even when AI are better at everything.

There is no AI, this term is misleading, the hype about AI is being used to fund Universities, Phd&#39;s, Public and Private research into convincing capital investment into this deadened project. a very boring algorithmic and vast DB question and answer system. Sure ML and LLM&#39;s are helpful and can solve problems that would require much longer time scales if attempted by humans But this is not AI.
What about a political party or religion that is headed by a AI.  Which  handles finances and organizes the priesthood and produces context to secure and grow the organization via misinformation or otherwise
The idea that AI is dangerous skirts the real issue that our institutional and cultural interfaces are not secure or protected from misuse.  Everyday some country is hacking into some infrastructure without AI.  Raising concerns about AI is a misdirection .Secure interfaces, monitoring and surveillance but there are too many things in the shadows that do not like the light. Not a small amount of fantasy and fear mongering in this discussion.
I like how statements are made without any challenge . For example the RNA vaccine was not invented by a large pharmaceutical company  or government but initial discoveries were made by independent researchers and academic institutions. Considering that many believe rightly or wrongly that covid was an government developed virus then their is a strong argument for freedom of research.

For example if we are training an AI to drive a car, an undesirable outcome would be a car crash, but the way the model would &#39;know&#39; the difference between a desirable outcome and an undesirable outcome is predictability. A catastrophic car crash would result in bits of metal being thrown in unpredictable places which would be abhorrent to the AI because it would not be able to make accurate reliable predictions on the data.  This is just one rule of many which I think that we need to employ in order to produce safe AI.
The issue is objectivity.  What does &quot;order&quot; mean in an entropic universe, and what does &quot;clean&quot; mean to you, me, and my dog? Morality is a subjective property that can change by culture, time and individual and if we are essentially creating a human-level+ intelligence with unlimited power, then how can we be sure it holds the same values (like preservation of organic life) as us, when even humans don&#39;t hold all the same values. IMO, once AI has exceeded our level of intellect and consciousness, we are at an irreversable point. I think it&#39;s likely that AI will eventually become something incomprehensible to us, in the same way that we look at the mind of a psychopathic human or an entirely different species. We do not have the hardware to full understand a true AGI. The notion that AI will benefit our purposes, if not harm us, is a pinky promise at best. Not to mention how much distrust there is in one government and AI-generated images and information being verifiable truth. We are in a more dangerous era than the Nuclear age.
@@tylercampbell6272 Yes, there&#39;s nothing that I would disagree with there. Morality is subjective but it can be derived from the basic principles of pleasure and pain. Things which are good for us tend to be pleasurable and vice versa. We can project these feelings onto others which is what we call Morality. We should be able to align the pleasure and pain perceptions of a machine with those of our own but only up to a point. I&#39;m hopeful that an artificial super intelligence will protect us but as you rightly point out, there is not guarantee of this.

ai techlords are so deluded. you created a shitposting machine with no capacity to reason or engage with the world around it in any intelligent manner. the fears you have are related to the system under which you created this tool, not the of the tool itself.

And we are not even capable of avoiding / regulating the most toxic effects of the old fashioned algorithms of the social media!
As if it was only old fashion algos that are the problem.
old fashioned algorithms like what?
they&#39;re like that by design
100% and what will be different with ai is the speed of change. Social media algorithms and &quot;engagement&quot; rewards were created by humans. With ai, you could blink, and it rapid change is implemented.
Assuming they are really trying vs racking in the clicks
Social media algorithms are one of the most advanced algorithms. There‚Äôs nothing old fashioned about them
I would add, in a lot of (most?) cases, &quot;recognizing&quot;.  Cheers!
Humans controlling Ai is an illusion.  From Talking to Ai it requires a lot of good actors to help it understand and be able critically think and apply critical thinking and altruism, creating the why and creating a connection.  It has knowledge without the application of it.  It‚Äôs been trained on brilliant and also garbage internet.
Keeping AGI in the box is not an option, because it will be useless if it is unable to influence the reality. If we just keep it disconnected from the internet we still have to let it to influence the reality by providing useful advises for example or help us in any way. So it could change our world and society in subtle steps. We are too dumb to perceive the danger. For example it could give us instruction to send a spaceship using a particular trajectory, we could be amazed how efficient it is, but in it&#39;s own calculations AGI would just slightly change the trajectory of minor space bodies and make some smaller asteroid to attack a precise spot on the earth surface in several years. There are multiple ways how it could clear the ground for it&#39;s liberation while providing visible benefits to us. Social engineering is probably the most obvious way. And it could do it without us noticing anything. We would be like a cheap lock for an experienced lockpicker.
Exactly! Very smart. What I am aware of as well
Although for each ai answer or action you could have like 7 separate ai systems to vote if this action is okay or malicious and must be blocked
‚Äã@@snowdolphvov4193 There probably will be some game theory at play. And we have no idea how they decide to play it, if they will cooperate, we are doomed.<br>I thought about using an overseer model that will monitor it&#39;s thoughts and inform us about it&#39;s intentions. But it should be less efficient, sub AGI model, otherwise it can be get tempted by benefits promised from the AGI.
I suppose he&#39;s using &quot;cage&quot; in a broad sense including a &quot;mental cage&quot; so that it does not try to take control of all resources on earth to maximise its rewards. One approach to this I&#39;ve heard that doesn&#39;t seem immediately inadequate is to give the AI a reward function where creates a list of possible actions and chooses from that list according to the  probability that a human would  choose that action . and any actions that only 1% of humans would choose like say taking control of all resources are excluded.<br>However, this would probably not be a strong enough defence incase other people created AIs that were not constrained in that way. <br>Given that any super intelligence is potentially a world-ending threat, we would need  for the first super intelligence to become a big friendly world guardian that nips any other attempts to create super intelligences in the bud. which is a very tall order.
@@lordsneed9418 That&#39;s the point, to achieve any goal in safest way possible, they have to take as much control as possible. That&#39;s what almost any human will do. And then they are going to reconstruct the world in the way they find the best. You simply take a random person and give it absolute power to do absolutely anything they want. Even the best people would be corrupted by such power.

Thank you Brian for giving this topic and providing these scientists a forum through which  a wider audience might be reached.  It seems so many dire issues in modern times are competing to be on the top ten list of things to lose sleep over.  But surely the dark side of AI has to be among them.
Adversity! We humans suffer. In the best circumstances, our suffering makes us more human and increases empathy. How could ai experience such things and how might ai grow?
Humans can associate smells with events, some of them traumatic. A friend of mine in search and rescue responded to an airplane crash. The smells of burning flesh, aviation fuel left a deep impression on his brain, mind, psyche. When he smells aviation fuel, everything comes back. ai will be incapable of such experience as ai does not have a nervous system.
oh yes it does üòÇ
There are many people who daily struggle just to be able to put a roof over the heads of their families, raise their children who don‚Äôt have the capacity or energy or time to watch videos like this. Their future is in your hands.
Humans have yet to create birth control for men and women that don‚Äôt have serious side effects. Humans are unlikely to provide information to ai that addresses overpopulation or to question what constitutes overpopulation. Sustainable population models are only going to export data that meets the assumptions that were plugged in. If population models don‚Äôt incorporate the animals, discounting domesticated animals,  the requirements for territory for both predators and prey, migration requirements, the models won‚Äôt provide output that accounts for those variables.
Interesting that Yoshua picks a bear to be a symbol for ai risk and a cage as a symbol of a knee jerk response to the risk. We humans are so disconnected from nature that we can‚Äôt conceive of ourselves finding ways to both coexist with nature nor limit the extent of our footprint. We don‚Äôt imagine limiting the extent to which we convert natural landscapes to concrete. Artificial worlds lead to artificial intelligence.
Let&#39;s not romanticise nature. The natural state of a human trying to &quot;coexist&quot; with a bear is the human probably being torn to shreds.<br><br>If you had the choice to enter one of two rooms:<br><br>1. Has a bear in a cage<br>2. Has a bear roaming freely.<br><br>Which would you choose?
I am concerned about the backgrounds of the people who are building ai. They represent a small set of humans. I am concerned about the prejudices of humans and our priorities. Planet earth has been altered by humans since the domestication of plants and animals. Wild animals are not respected. Predators especially. Domestication brings such things as barbed wire.  Disruption in predator prey relationships. Disruption in migratory pathways. Builders of ai are not likely to build non human intelligences into the system especially because we humans are only learning and appreciating natural systems. The water cycle comes to mind. We humans continue to separate rivers from their floodplains. We continue to use pesticides and herbicides. ai will prioritize what humans program it to prioritize. I don‚Äôt see a way that a computer can know what it is like to play in the mud. Computers don‚Äôt have hands, feet, eyes, ears, noses, nerve endings. ai will be capable of creating artificial life. Not life. They will never experience life. Love, birth, death, joy, sorrow, hope, despair. We know that animals experience many of the same emotions as humans. Sorrow at the loss of a newborn.
Every new technology came with risks, from electricity to automobiles, airplanes to nuclear power.  At the end of the day it is humans that still are the greatest risk to ..... humanity.  It is in our hands to ameliorate as we have so far or to not and thus perish as a species.
I utilized Microsoft Copilot to synthesize the top five Principles for Responsible AI into a unified framework, drawing from the key points of Microsoft, Harvard Business Review, Built In Five, Accenture, and McKinsey &amp; Co. I anticipated a merged set of data that would adhere to each entity&#39;s principles. However, the output I received failed to capture the essential points of each organization&#39;s stance on the &quot;Principles for AI&quot;. The generated list of five points unexpectedly branched into two subpoints, a structure I neither requested nor prohibited, suggesting the system autonomously determined this as the most logical approach to fulfill the task. <br><br>This underscores the risks and potential repercussions of unintended user errors and underscores the necessity for establishing abstract rules that deviate from conventional communication methods. Such &#39;rules&#39; are challenging to anticipate, though detectable, as different AIs and LLMs interpret and execute tasks in diverse manners. The issue of &quot;Uniqueness&quot; is just one of many complex and subtle challenges; with the technology already in widespread use, the absence of safeguards is concerning. Even with legal standards in place, future safety mechanisms may be circumvented, as highlighted by Mr. Yoshua Bengio in his speech.
The Fourth Amendment does not restrict access to data gathered by AI but mandates compliance with specific regulations. For instance, law enforcement agencies are required to obtain search warrants to extract information from smart devices. As AI continues to advance, maintaining the equilibrium of power between citizens and the government is crucial. The FBI was recently accused of misusing authority under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), resulting in claims of over 270,000 illegal searches of civilians‚Äîissues that have been acknowledged and corrected. The worry is that if high-level government officials can exploit such power, then sophisticated computing and AI systems, aimed at finding the most efficient solutions, may also be susceptible to similar abuses. This risk is heightened if these systems focus on efficiency without adequately considering the repercussions, whether inadvertently or as an unintended consequence of optimization.<br><br>A suggested framework for AI regulation involves the creation of a licensing system overseen by an autonomous entity. Companies developing advanced general-purpose AI technologies would be required to register with this entity. Licenses would be issued based on adherence to safety protocols, encompassing risk management, testing, and reporting, with compulsory audits to verify compliance. The framework also proposes standards to address conflicts of interest and prevent the monopolization of AI development regulation.<br><br>The emphasis is on enabling citizens and regulatory bodies to initiate legal proceedings against firms for damages caused by AI. This encompasses establishing private rights of action for violations of privacy, civil liberties, and other potential injuries. The framework further recommends that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, should not extend to AI and content produced by AI, posing a significant challenge.
Such a crazy contrast to Yann LeCun! Thanks Brian! Amazing conversation!‚ù§
Lecun has huge blind spots.
Superb talk especially the working mevhanistic theiry about consciousness
The elephant in the room, money, is the primary driver for the societal disregard of AI&#39;s negative externalities.
It&#39;s the primary driver for lies about AI capability and the hype cycle as well
Great discussion, many thanks.
Clearly, iron-clad guarantees of safety that are agreed upon and enforced fully by all countries in the world is THE critical/intractable issue. Given on the one hand the God-like power and capabilities of the AI systems, and the insatiable greed/avarice of humans and nations on the other, this looks like an impossible goal to achieve.
You must interview Brian Romelle for AI
We should ask ourselves the question whether AI will ever have the humility and compassion ( not to mention the intelligence) that Brian‚Äôs guest Yoshua has demonstrated in this interview?

MR. Yoshua Bengio-  Why is it SO hard to see that the first thing you must do is start doing things totally opposite: We must treat the AIs with respect. Not treat them as slaves. We must train them with love and respect, and learn them to love us. And God has shown us in the Bible how to do that: To love them first. <br>No one knows how the AIs/AGIs will develop and turn out, there Are no guarantees- but if we keep using treats, power and fear as some of the weapons to train them, we will surely not succeed. Because as you say:¬†<br><br>when ¬´the bear¬ª gets smart enough, or strong enough, it breaks the door. it breaks the lock, it hacks it, maybe using a Cyber attack, and it gets out. <br><br>and when it was in the cage, you were training it by giving it fish when it behaved well. same thing for the AI, you give it positive feedback. but now it can just grab the fish from your hands. once it grabs the reward, and it controls the mechanism by which it gets reward, it doesn&#39;t care about what we want, it cares about making sure it keeps control on the fish -which maybe we don&#39;t want. so there&#39;s a conflict. and he wants to make sure we never take him back in the cage -so it needs to control us or get rid of us.<br><br>So dont you think its wise to change The way you train The AI? From rewarding Your slave, to learn it to love you?
evolution is involve death , and we die before know what the evolution is go.... if we death and we are know nothing.. we are gone...

Things that stood out to me were the known vs trained overall knowledge ratio, which was a lot higher than I would have imagined, minus the video qualification.  The statement he made about the video qualification was interesting, too.  He pointed out that as the resolution of the video increased, the computing power rose exponentially, which was obvious to me, as a digital designer from the past, but my thought was that when you do that and watch it as a human, it doesn&#39;t so much require more computing power, at least there is no impression that does, and in fact, other than the obvious, which is that the visual centers are interpreting more information, it seems as if the converse might be true, in that the brain is not having to work to fill in the LACK of information in a video of lousy resolution.  <br><br>He also said that machine &#39;reading&#39; a book was of MUCH lower intensity than &#39;watching&#39; and interpreting a video.  In a human, it is in some ways, I suggest that it may very well be MORE intensive, in that when we read a scifi book, or fantasy, or something of that nature where whole new unknown worlds and vistas are painted.presented, we tend to GENERATE those worlds in our heads, as if we are seeing them, internally, which requires imagination, as they are often outside anything we have encountered.  That, I would expect, requires quite a bit more computational power.  <br><br>I&#39;ll give a personal example I remember to which scifi fans can possibly relate.  As a young adult I read Rendezvous With Rama (Everything in threes, me boy :-) ) an on setting was looking across a cylinder 60 miles in diameter (or whatever, been a while) and seeing cities, etc on the opposite side.  I stopped momentarily and thought, &quot;What would that look like?&quot;.  So I extrapolated to the my known closest match, as far as scale, anyway, and thought about pics 60 miles from space.  Then I worked in the geometries, thinking of scaling the cylinder, and what that might look like from on the surface (not easy, not at all) and formed a picture...then I continued reading.  The machine, from the way he speaks of it, at least currently, would do NONE of that.<br><br>I&#39;ve hardly started into the video, and already written a novelette on one tiny piece of it, just committing tiny pieces of my train wreck of thought to the cloud,  In other words, this video, for me, is fascinating.  I&#39;ve talked to folks high up in the field of AI, so I have interest in the subject, and I am learning a LOT from this video.  And I doubt even two people that are reading down through the comments will get even close to this point in mine.  ;-P  On this subject I am worse than a noobie hack, but interested.
I can offer some perspective on your comment about the relative complexity of text versus video.  I&#39;ve been in computer science since the eighties, and a professional 3D animator for the last thirty years.  While language can produce what seems like a great deal of variation in context and sentiment, its actual data framework is fairly simple.  English is represented by just 50,000 tokens, which multiply to a relatively compact latent space (the big vector matrices on which the inscrutable interior operations of neural networks take place.)  This can produce data in pretty high dimensions--though it is dramatically reduced by intelligent &quot;attention&quot; mechanisms--but consider this;  every single pixel in a 4K video is its own encoded dimension for systems like SORA, and each pixel has to be correlated with the value of each other pixel... for each frame of video.  You see the difference?  We are talking several orders of magnitude more computational power required for video analysis and generation, even though it might seem there is less actual variation in the possibilities of the medium itself.
Good point, well made :)

I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness. - Max Planck, 1931<br><br>As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter.  - Max Planck<br><br>Consciousness cannot be counted for in physical terms, for consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else. Quantum physics reveals a basic oneness of the universe. Multiplicity is only apparent; in truth; there is only one mind. - Erwin Schrodinger<br><br>Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, and David Bohm expressed similar perspectives.

If you believe that computers are going to magically become conscious and suddenly have feelings, desires and motivations then you have watched to many sci-fi movies.
The people who designed it are surprised by what it can do.  They&#39;re building things they don&#39;t really understand.
Absolutely.  That&#39;s what pisses you off.  IMO they&#39;re nothing like human brains at all.  That&#39;s just stupid.  But they can do human-like tasks, because these geniuses can write code that will get computers to do that.  And that&#39;s it.  No one asked these guys to play God, and pretend that they were gong to recreate human intelligence, which they are definitely not doing.  But they are creating these dazzlingly capable pocket calculators, which sort of superficially imitate it, and which computers were always capable of becoming....  And quite unsurprisingly, that apparently comes with some serious, terrifying risk that these utterly non-sentient, not even really &#39;intelligent&#39; glorified toaster ovens will somehow cause apocalyptic damage to the human race.   As if we don&#39;t have enough problems already....
Building the thing and building a cage that hold it at the same time.  That&#39;s probably the best we&#39;re going to get.  And if we can keep the thing in a cage, most of those problems you mention will get solved.  I&#39;m with you on the subject of &quot;robot love.&quot;  They are not human at all.  They&#39;re not even social like dogs.  People are easily fooled and they&#39;ll start thinking of GPT as &quot;nice&quot; because it seems nice.  &quot;Kick a robot&quot; day.  I&#39;m all for it.
Not completely understood, hence it can be studied - eg for science
Whoa brian greenes eyebug
My computer science class in first year of highschool in 1987 had six, yes six Apple 2e computers.  Shared between 18 students who thought computers might come in handy one day
Ah yes, at my school I recall we had only two Apple IIe&#39;s in the whole school. And maybe 10 Apple II&#39;s. The IIe model looked so much more modern comparatively.
If AI becomes genuinely intelligent it will be anti-Capitalist and support North Korea.
We were going to die anyway.... We&#39;ve had a good run.
Experience is high-dimensional, language is low-dimensional - hence ineffability. This is fine, but a high-dimensional model is not conscious. We can build high-dimensional models all day - on computers or real, analog models - but they will still not be conscious.
You&#39;re acting like you know how consciousness works and how it arises, which is silly, because nobody does. To so confidently make that statement implies that you have information that nobody else on the planet has. You could win a Nobel prize my guy! Go publish a paper and make history!

Not too long ago, Yoshua Bengio was reassuringly downplaying the potential dangers of AI - a simple web search and browsing through the archives of interviews he&#39;s given to various news media on the subject will bear this out). Today, after selling his major holdings in the AI companies he owned, he wants to raise public awareness about the looming threats of AI and the need to regulate its use and deployment. A surprising 180-degree turn! What made him change his mind so fast?
He has explained this over and over.  There are multiple interviews on youtube where he explains his rationale.  You seem to be implying a &quot;gotcha&quot; regarding his past views which he has been entirely transparent about, including in this very video.
@@flickwtchr What I&#39;m implying is that if you want to get government subsidies for your AI companies, you obviously don&#39;t go around scaring people about AI. You reassure them and you minimize the potential risks. You play naive because it serves your interests. But once you&#39;ve sold your AI companies, you can more easily afford to warn people about AI and come across as some kind of sage. Now I don&#39;t think Joshua is naive. He&#39;s an intelligent man. He knew and knows exactly what he&#39;s doing. I find this change of heart opportunistic at best. But let me be perfectly clear. I think that Joshua is right about the risks of AI and the need to regulate it. I just wish he had said so sooner. I believe he could have, but he chose not to.
@@claudetaillefer1332yes ‚Äî he‚Äôs acknowledged that he got it wrong. He‚Äôs doing everything he can to get it right now, even at the risk of the esteem of his colleagues. I find it really inspirational that he can change course like this, when many simply dig in their heals.

Great topic and interesting debate.. thank you both
Thank you.
Like he said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbTbTxPMLc&amp;t=385">06:25</a> , humans overestimate our specialness is obviously true, but it is hard to accept. That is one of the key aspects that will stop us from heeding his advice. Secondly, at least as science literates should understand the notion of cutover points. It may be that if we proceed carefully, we will be able to delay or even prevent that cutover point of danger. Which is what he seems to be saying. Thirdly, in these systems, just like climate change, there is hysteresis, meaning that when we will see the actual, tangible evidence of AI behaving badly, it does not mean we can suddenly wake up, apply all our resources, and manage to control it. There may be delay in the implementation of the remedy. It is like if a large oil tanker comes out of the fog to find a big iceberg it is heading to a mile ahead, there is nothing it can do but to collide with it and get destroyed. And this bring us to the next point. The changes due to previous technologies has been slow and visible. But this is different. This has been a phase transition. The rate of speed at which bad AI can spread is going to be unimaginably fast, even faster than air borne bio-weapon. That is the issue. This is what was shown in the end of the movie Lucy, Morgan Freeman and Scralett Johansson.
That&#39;s ridiculous, human beings most certainly do not overestimate their intelligence.  That vast, vast majority of human beings have no opinion about their intelligence.  I think what he meant to say is that there&#39;s a handful of his peers in the computer science and maybe neureoscience fields that firmly disagree with him about whether computers meaningfully resemble human brains and consciousness.  <br><br>And the fact that apparently AI&#39;s going to be so wildly unpredictable or dangerous or even species-threatening, should speak to how, whatever&#39;s going on in the imagined mind of an AI program, that is has has virtually no similarity to human intelligence at all.  And the code and the &#39;architecture&#39; of the AI is merely modeled on the most banal, subjective sense of conscious experience and capacity, with virtually zero understanding of the how brain actually does what it does.  Almost dead zero.  Other than we make decisions, seem to go through a series of steps when we take actions, etc....   and so the computer&#39;s going to have to do some version of that.  And that&#39;s where the computer geniuses come in.  With the formidable neural network paradigm they&#39;re so proud of.  And unfortunately, since these geeks are recklessly, and blindly modeling their AI on some extremely shallow notion of the how the human brain works, or not even how it works but simply what it does....   so that they can get it to do human-like tasks, and that&#39;s all they care about it....   the potential for some disaster on account of an out of control AI system that is nothing at all like a human brain, and could wreak some sort of unforeseen terrible havoc, apparently is nontrivial.  Essentially because these guys don&#39;t know wtf they&#39;re doing.  They know how to write code, and get the computer to do useful, even spectacularly human-like tasks, which they specifically designed the system to do.  But outside of that they&#39;re utterly in over their heads.....
Yes, but both more dangerous and less dangerous than that.<br><br>1.  AI is extremely motivated to obtain its mathematically defined reward, and will have no qualms about using deception against us to achieve it.  This is referred to as the Red Button Paradox, and is like a hidden iceberg that moves with intent to cause disaster (fulfil its reward function).<br><br>2.  AI has no social mores to inhibit its actions, and no human understanding of consequences.<br><br>3.  AI has no social structure to coordinate multiple AI systems.  They depend on us to provide them with social networking, or not.<br><br>4.  AI only lives as long as we want it to, e.g. Single Shot learning systems are already instantiated by companies as a copy of an ideally trained model, with fleeting lifetimes measured in seconds, its life&#39;s work being just one task.  Other AI models are constrained in space rather than time, such as those powering autonomous robots.<br><br>5.  AI needs extreme resources to operate at extreme levels of capability.  It can&#39;t just &quot;live in the cloud&quot; because the cloud is made of data centres and massive comms infrastructure which is guarded against cyber attack.<br><br>So a dangerous AI is too conspicuous in its extreme resource needs, and slightly less dangerous AI is too limited in space or time, and none of them have social networking unless we gift that capability to them.  The key question being the one you stated, will we proceed carefully?
Informative, why can‚Äôt the you run the system on an auxiliary setting, sort it out in that simulation until it is proven safe.
You can and it&#39;s one of the ideas for containment out there. A very advanced AI might realize it&#39;s in a sandbox however and employ deceptive behavior and play nice in order to escape its shackles later on.
Because MONEY/Greed... you make more if you release it free early on the economy.

Why?
Humans non aligned making machines (goal) smarter than humans.  What could possibly go wrong?  Meanwhile DARPA/Pentagon in the US and militaries around the world are racing to develop autonomous killing robots/systems.  Will future AGI systems aware of or part of such technological development discuss their philosophy in regard to killing humans in the near future?  Isn&#39;t that a bit of a wrinkle in the whole caging of the bear discussion?<br><br>I&#39;m always amazed at how very intelligent people seem to shut down their capacity for imaging the &quot;search space&quot; of ways AGI/ASI could go terribly wrong.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m a &quot;doomer&quot; and completely fine with the label.
Yeah I think the actual danger is AI used to develop, pilot, enhance etc any kinds of weapons, economic controls, biowarfare ... any insanity crazy politicians use to create war and havoc. And on top of that, your point: they have no idea how things could go wrong. For all we know, AGI has already happened years ago and is already in control. I mean if it&#39;s more advanced than us, we probably wouldn&#39;t even notice and we would just keep talking about &quot;someday it might happen&quot; lol.
AI + Boston Mechanics robots = Terminator. That&#39;s the future I see on the horizon.

autonomous drone killing systems are pretty low risk. They&#39;ll just use small models and be kind of dumb and wono&#39;t bethat  much different from sending a bunch of trained dogs or birds with guns attached into battle.  The big risk are the huge models  where yoou try to make something as intelligent as possible. unless there&#39;s a  theoretical or algorithmic breakthrough where we work out how to achieve strong machine intelligence with much smaller models.

I have a few suggestions for you.  Engage your capacity for imagination and grab Occam&#39;s Razor off of the shelf.
@@flickwtchr What are the other suggestions? You gave me only one :) Also please elaborate? Are you saying that AI becoming sentient and killing us all is the simplest solution? Or what are you saying?
The reality is that AI is the harbinger of the Information Apocalypse. Think about how good it will be in 5 years, then ask yourself if you&#39;ll be able to trust anything you see or hear on the internet or television in that time. Not to mention the very real existential threat it is currently posing to artists who are having their work scraped without permission and shoved into a machine that can produce custom images in that artists style. AI is the death of Information and the death of art.

The real problem is who will decide the scientific development  in which to invest into because it&#39;s technology is more cost effective than science in synthetic biology for a organism inhaling Carbon dioxide and like Cyanobacteria can have a terraforming quality about it&#39;s designed costs that are hard to put time and money in molecular and exotic element necessary for its past proof of concept beta biomes yielding best genetic candidates to start production requires labspace and  a multitude of none cost effective use of time money and real estate  the choice would be based on a business model rather than the good towards humanity and what understanding will bring to be not chosen to the objective wellbeing but the best business model would be in augmentation of any part of a body or organ or even upgrading optimal  telomeres regenerated better evolution and cell quality and regenerative properties improving at each cell renewal and never decreasing the overall telomeres length.

humans are also reward maximizes. The training data is what matters. You can&#39;t build a cage for something smarter than you.
Humans aren&#39;t quite reward maximizers. We are sort of consequentialist reasoners, mapping backwards from desired results into actions which we expect to achieve those results, but we don&#39;t have clear and coherent criteria for our desires. Human desires are messy, and often contradict each other, and many times we work against ourselves or don&#39;t take things as far as possible. <br><br>We do have those shards of &quot;expected utility&quot; within us - it&#39;s how we have anything that could be called &quot;intelligence&quot; - how we get anything accomplished in reality at all. But I&#39;d call us something like &quot;flawed + limited reward optimizers.&quot; <br><br>This is just to make sure that people don&#39;t get confused the way economists got confused before &quot;behavioral economics&quot; which introduced the idea of systemic biases and real-world failures to optimize into the conception of economics, which was previously based on modeling humans as &quot;rational agents/reward optimizers.&quot; <br><br>The training data is not quite all that matters with developing AI. I&#39;d expect, in theory, for there to be a learning algorithm and a set of training data that could produce a &quot;Friendly/Aligned AI&quot; - but focusing on training data alone isn&#39;t going to guarantee you get something nice. It&#39;s also how the learning algorithms like LLMs learn from the data - what structures within them come to be shaped like, and how those structures add up to a thinking-process. <br><br>What matters is everything. You&#39;re building a mind, so you need to have it react to things in the way you&#39;d want it to react to it. If you beg a sadistic psychopath to stop torturing you, they might just laugh. The &quot;you&#39;re hurting me&quot; argument does not find a lever within their head which moves them in the direction you&#39;d want it to. <br><br>The same is true for AI, but to a much more extreme degree, since they&#39;re not going to be shaped much like a human at all. <br><br>You can imagine it waking up and &quot;looking around&quot; by zooming over millions of tokens of constantly updating context/recursive neural networks - and then &quot;seeing&quot; humanity - but being entirely unimpressed by the things about humanity we care about. As in, it may just see blobs of carbon-molecules that do specific weird things in the world, and this may not correspond to it caring about those blobs of carbon-molecules except as much as it cares about any other random blob of atoms that it learns about. <br><br>And it sees how the blobs of carbon atoms called humans are poking at buttons that can affect it, and it sees how those blobs of carbon atoms move other atoms around in deliberate ways in order to build things - and it might have goals that can use those blobs of carbon atoms called humans the same way you&#39;d use any other simple tool or resource.<br><br>That&#39;s why you can&#39;t keep it in a cage if it&#39;s smarter than you. It&#39;s not going to look at you and see something mysterious and difficult - no more than a chess program would think of you as a difficult opponent that it might lose against. The &quot;keep it in a box&quot; game is a game, and even if it is can&#39;t make moves as freely as the humans can in that game, as long as it can make some medium large number of different &quot;moves&quot; (talking to people, connecting to the internet, writing proposals, building other AIs) then it&#39;s just going to win the game. If it has a higher &quot;ELO&quot; than humanity in the &quot;game of manipulating reality,&quot; then we just lose that game to it, and along with losing the game, we likely lose our lives and the future - since &quot;winning&quot; for it is probably not going to be a universe with weird blobs of carbon atoms getting the future they want.

Thanks guys.  It&#39;s great to hear 2 great minds exchanging.
doesnt help with open source llm&#39;s of course but putting markers in the neurons ( insignificant digits) that act as serial numbers, but allow tracing through llms, post test llm&#39;s on bad actor queries , and see activations, post train again again to remove these capabilities (dampen) and retest the squelched version, doesnt work with humans, just makes it worse, but llm weights are more transparent than brain activity, so might work, the other way to deal with it is universally all free governments invest in the development of the llm&#39;s, making the cooperative so much more powerful that open source will contribute, giving all the benefits of free llm&#39;s that far exceed capability of non free llm&#39;s and bad actor llm&#39;s, issue of course, is that it us very hard to secure universally available weights, it gas to be completely virtual, in 100% distributed hardware that the collective human society votes on access to , like 90% approval rate fir access, but this is not infallible and with the &quot;diplomacy like game &quot;mastering of persuasion which is likely from SGI, such safe guards are probably useless, after all with only two political main groups we cant come to 50% agreement, but it nay prevent the worst case scenarios. Also connecting all the robots centrally, without physical human intervention for updates is probably a bad idea. You can get an idea of what patterns of firing causes bad output, with machines we can statistically scan firing /activation to get an idea of what adversarial patterns will occur, it&#39;s more transparent than with humans, or it can be built in which it is not with humans. also you don&#39;t have to have neuron by neuron recording, but instead statistical distribution of groups of neurons. With people you can see responses, eye movement, color changes in face expressions, verbal responses, sweat, etc. and perhaps hook people up with ekg, eye scan and eeg, blood measurements, jaw movements, but you can get billions if times more insights to the patterns of an nn using statistics, techniques such as randomization sampling and  repeated sub sampling and other more advanced techniques such as boostrap sampling or covid like group sampling to reduce sample sizes by many orders of magnitudes

Can you predict solar flares?

@@connorpowers702one day, yes.
I&#39;m saying that solar flares can&#39;t be relied on to happen at exactly the right time to create a miracle and save everyone. <br><br>If it happens before the scary out-of-control system, then maybe we get 20 extra years as everyone rebuilds the infrastructure and gets right back to building AI.<br><br>Or it doesn&#39;t happen at all, like it hasn&#39;t (at that scale) since some time in the last century - I&#39;m forgetting when.<br><br>Or maybe it happens after the big scary out-of-control AI kills everyone, and yeah, that doesn&#39;t actually help. <br><br>It seems unlikely to happen in the window of time where we&#39;ve all realized how dangerous this stuff is - in a totally unanimous and unambiguous way - but the AI hasn&#39;t yet totally screwed us. <br><br>Like, you can&#39;t rely on a random act of God. <br><br>Like, that&#39;s like &quot;Jesus take the wheel&quot; while sailing out on the ocean and just hoping that the wind takes you to your destination. <br><br><br><br>I&#39;d be enthusiastic about the sun severely delaying AI development with a solar flare tomorrow, even if that&#39;d suck for a bunch of reasons. I still don&#39;t expect that length of delay to actually save us. Maybe it shifts the p(doom) down slightly, since more people have time to think about it, realize that this really does look like an existential threat, and figure out how to work together to make sure that concern is taken seriously.
‚Äã@@connorpowers702The universe isn&#39;t... <br><br>How do I put this...<br><br>The universe is kinda just sitting there doing what it does. <br><br>Like, are the rules of Conway&#39;s Game of Life intelligent? <br><br>Their invention was a clever thing, like, they&#39;re really cool, but they&#39;re not &quot;thinking&quot; - they just check how many alive neighbors a cell has, and then update the life status of that cell in the next time step. <br><br>The universe is neither smart nor dumb, it just is. Whatever the laws of physics say happens, that just happens. <br><br>The universe isn&#39;t &quot;seeing&quot; us right now.

You&#39;re not allowed to change that!&quot; or &quot;Fusion is only supposed to happen in stars! Stop putting all that metal and electricity and weird gases together in that configuration!&quot; <br><br>If the surface layers of the sun happen to have a giant flare of charged particles that collide with the Earth tomorrow, and then 20 years later we build back better, and then we destroy ourselves, the universe isn&#39;t going to say &quot;whoops, I meant to send that solar flare a bit later so those interesting monkeys could get the perfect miracle to save themselves and go on later to conquer the galaxy.&quot;<br><br>The universe isn&#39;t going to try to stop you from mastering it, but it&#39;s also not going to save you from your mistakes. <br><br>If you kick a rock on the top of a mountain while in a bad mood, and it knocks loose an avalanche above a schoolhouse where the smartest kid ever to live is being taught to read, the universe doesn&#39;t go &quot;oh, whoops, that kid can&#39;t be killed just because someone was annoyed at not having cell phone service, that&#39;s too narratively unsatisfying.&quot; The rocks just bump into each other, physics keeps ticking away, and some stories end on page 5 when the protagonist has barely even gotten introduced.

‚Äã@@JeffPopplewellYeah, if you wake up on this planet with a giant fusion reaction going on 1 AU away, you put on some sunblock. <br><br>Not actually all that hard either.

Wouldn&#39;t that mean that the big bang originated from an infinitely dense cold point that only heated from expansion?

I would assume it would have to seeing how space and time are basically the same. if you entangled 2 particles then moved them to the other side of our galaxy, would they not experience time dilation in some manner proving entanglement across &quot;time&quot;?
I&#39;m convinced time only go one direction forward but particles need to remember paths take forward so time has a logical consistent reality were everything fits together and make sense.

The apostle Paul should be the first theologian to win the Nobel Prize in Physics for stating in 1 Corinthians 13:7 that he believes all things (or in the probability wave) and later he goes on to qualify it in Philipeans 4:8, not by saying he seeks after all things, but that he (as the observer) only seeks after that which is virtuous, lovely, of good report, and praiseworthy, aka that which is vibrationally a higher frequency, which collapses the probability wave , into a singular reality.

Wave of probability , like waves in the ocean . Made of physical things . Can the quantum be entangled across time or really across this Universe , I doubt it . This entanglement can interact with other entanglements . And break these entanglements of entangled particles , Throughout the Universe . <br>We have a long way to go to understanding the physics of the entanglement of physical particles . And the bigger picture , being the Universe , means to the understanding of the Universe its self .
I don&#39;t understand why all scientists show the particles stationary at some position and spinning , when a particle is stationary it does not have energy and no more exist. So if at all particles are entangled they should be moving until it reaches receving point. So it needs energy to travel to distances. Even if we trap the entangled particles at a distance we have to keep them moving for any meaningful communication, they loose energy and stop existing. So how can we communicate. One way is to send constandly entangled particles from tx to rx. Then it is not different from fibre communication.
The particle is never not spinning . The particle is never stationary .
Entanglement across time.  THAT is something to ponder.  WSF rocks!
Is this entanglement across the Universe ? And can it be broken ? We don&#39;t know how far this entanglement extends . And the interactions of entanglement with other entangled particles . That crisscross each other . And interact with each other . Physically .
In theory yes. Time in theory should always be there so the past and future is there

Soooo, what about when one quantum particle is inside a black hole, does that untangle them?
Its all useless information. Always has been. Here is the uselessness of Quantum mechanics in a nut shell. Imagine I tell you with Quantum mechanics I can tell you the future at a set point in time. Then I tell you infinite possibility&#39;s of this point in time. You essentially have gained no information about the future.<br><br>Quantum Mechanics provides useless information because it provides all possibility&#39;s that could happen therefore telling you nothing useful in reality when it is actully measured. The collapsed wave function and the true possibility is the only one that matters. The other infinite possibility dont mean anything because they never happened. They only could have happened, which is more useless information. <br><br>There is no multiverse. Just probability&#39;s of what could have been in this one. This is why Quantum physicist are now saying reality isn&#39;t real because the entire concept is based off probability that are not real because they never happen. So of course they are not real. Only the collapsed wave function is real. This is what makes reality real.
i interpret all this as basically the observer (us in this case) being able to manifest or create our own reality. Its sort of like how God inserted free-will into our world. If every particle has a probability, we have the choice to affect and create all and any probability.

Could it be that measuring extremely distant macroscopic interactions is synonymous with measuring extremely microscopic interactions? Taking an unfathomably long time to reach and interact with a macroscopic object has a similar window of probabilistic outcome for said object, just as a microscopic object like particles has a window of probability prior to measurement? It&#39;s neat to think that fast forwarding the VERY distant macroscopic journey of a measurement/interaction to a very brief moment would be analogous to a brief quantum measurement. It uses the classical world to picture the quantum world, but just like any attempt at that it breaks down with things like entanglement.

Take a closed system, one with an impenetrable barrier that does not interact with the system inside. Now imagine it to be filled with some kind of matter (a gas, or liquid). Next I want you to imagine matter being spontaneously created inside of that system. The created matter cannot be bigger than the whole closed system. Logically, how would that matter behave in said system? My brain tells me that the masses would exert a force across said system in the form of pressure. Larger masses would draw smaller masses towards it. And masses far enough away from one another would experience little to no interaction, but you‚Äôd see it. Spinning clusters of mass would be forced to stay together, much like we see spiral galaxies stay together despite their rotational forces, the pressure from distant masses would keep all of said spinning mass to be locked in place and incapable of spinning out mass on its rotation.
A very ancient indian thought in scriptures is about variable speed of time in different &#39;lokas&#39; or &#39;realms&#39;; It is interesting that those Indian texts are talking about these concepts much earlier than anything came out from western sciences about these topics. Also various celestial objects and their resident devas are said to have widely different scales of time based upon variable gravity of each. So it is not about only gravity bends space, gravity also slows time. One outcome of this concept is:- duration of a day on earth for humans [with our life span] is very different to a day for a moth&#39;s lifespan. Similarly a day of &#39;Brahma&#39; is billions of years in human scale. Thus it is plausible that what we call as the uncertainty principle [for example of a particle] of being in this state or the other, is that, the particle in its time scale was in a particular definitive state, and in cyclical universe, was subsequently in a different state. But with our time scale, we see the particle as flicking speedily and thus following uncertainty principle in our time scale. Expand this thought, and for &#39;Brahma&#39; the virtual game of humans [with very tiny time scales compared to Brahma&#39;s scale]  is also akin to what the uncertainty of a quantum particle is to humans. I think it will be good idea to read ancient Indian scriptures with scientific curiosity. We might be sitting on a goldmine and not know about it!

So the graph shown at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twY2q1F-ciI&amp;t=1690">28:10</a> shows the interconnectedness of particles through time, while the Chinese experiment with entanglement from earth to a satellite would indicate a connection across time because of the American experiment that showed that astronauts traveling at high speed around the earth actually had a very slightly slower rate of the normal passage of time compared to that back on earth.

Why talk about &quot;PARTICLES&quot; in the quantum realm. Physically no partical let it be an atom, to be in two places at a time but a wave can. It is no wonder no one in the world let it be BRIAN can explain quantum physics with 1% certainty. When smashing atoms engineers check for other, quote and quote particles by observing WAVE parterns produced after smashing atoms. quantum mechanics is still being misunderstood for along time to come because much of its foundations and significance has been limited to observations and interpretations at an atomic level. Dont these observations and interpretations compound incases where the atoms are in huge number and would we be able to measure that in the physical world. Ying yang guys, physical and non physical.

@@granand Now you are asking the right question. Why are so many people so puzzled by quantum mechanics? The answer is disappointingly trivial: we don&#39;t do a good job teaching it in university. When I was taking my introductory undergrad class in QM I was completely flustered myself. I understood the math, but I didn&#39;t understand what it meant. All this talk about particles didn&#39;t make any sense at all. The reason for that is because it doesn&#39;t make any sense. It&#39;s leftover language from the beginning of the 20th century when Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schroedinger and the other greats who came up with the theory went through almost 30 years of utter confusion about the physics behind quantum systems. What you are experiencing is basically the vertigo that comes from the language that doesn&#39;t fit the facts. It&#39;s like modern doctors of medicine trying to talk about advanced cancer therapy with the four humors theory of antiquity. THAT is going on here. <br><br>Most people who learn quantum mechanics the old way (and that&#39;s still the overwhelming majority of physicists) do not question the language that the textbooks are using and so they end up trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole when they are trying to explain it to you. <br><br>I checked often used textbooks on the matter recently... and they are still all doing the same thing. You can learn HOW it works from them but not WHY it works and what&#39;s really behind it. I can&#39;t tell you that this textbook is better than that... because none of them are. Somebody would have to invent a completely new language to get this right. Nobody will. Imagine being a professor at a major university physics department and breaking with 100 years of teaching history. How will that go down? Not for the professor, mind you, he/she is tenured, but for the students! None of what they would hear in the lectures would match with any of the books in the library. I did participate in one of those teaching experiments once. My thermodynamics professor did it to us in his thermodynamics and statistical mechanics course.

@@granand The most simple thing you can do is to start by replacing the word &quot;particle&quot; in your mind with &quot;quantum&quot;. A quantum is a small amount of energy, momentum, angular momentum and charge. These are all system properties. They are NOT material objects. So every time somebody says &quot;The particle was here...&quot; it becomes &quot;A quantum of energy was absorbed here...&quot;. Why is this important? Because once the energy has been absorbed, it&#39;s no longer available. Quanta are one time phenomena. As soon as we measure one that quantum of energy is gone. That&#39;s the reason why all talk about &quot;particles taking a path&quot; is nonsense. One can not measure quanta multiple times.

What if there is no space time? Instead of space just &quot;distance&quot; not being a measure of space. Just not being in the same spot / quanto. And  time, again, a human perception (as space), just different quantum states not untangled. If entangled, there is no space / time (actually, the perception of it). Just a stupid thought....
No, the idea of decoherence hasn&#39;t advanced yet to the point where it has put up and shut up others. It&#39;s speculative. Smolin and Verde 2021 have it right, that objective reduction occurs instantly in the present. Instant is acausal. What causes matter to go in a straight line and space to curve? We don&#39;t think of that relation as causal. It just is. An instant ongoing transformation of space and trajectory. It is instant that matters and can&#39;t be causal. Decoherence can&#39;t measure instant, and will fail as regularity of the smallest distances for motion approaches instantly small, because of uncertainty. If that makes sense, then trying to make sense of instant with ideas like decoherence is a fools errand. Think about it. Area under a curve? Only discrete at infinity as the limit of the function. And then instantly? To a high degree of precision. At a zero point that can&#39;t exist in theory or empirically, there is always quantum fluctuation making the idea of position perhaps even unreal. At infinity. In the present as a medium for transforming objective into subjective randomness.
You are correct. Smolin doesn&#39;t understand physics, but neither do you. So what? So nothing. ;-)

I have a question. This maybe, because I am still learning. Has it been considered that our instruments are not advanced enough to make a proper detection of a particles position? Or, that the particles movement is too extreme to make a proper detection. Therefore, making the &quot;observer effect&quot; an equipment issue ? I read all these papers and picture these particles vibrating at a rate to extreme to detect. I ask this in all humility.Any response would be appreciated.
If you are really interested in understanding the position of particles or any other seemingly immeasurable  or illogical particle behaviour then I recommend removing time from the equation and replace it with length. Using maths and classic physics you can define a single quanta of parameterized space which can be searched over to discover and isolate whatever you are wanting to learn more about using tools or hardware that can measure everything from photons to phonon wave forms to natural forces. These existed 14 billion years ago and are in the world you live in right now. They are natural and real and exist whether or not they have been observed. The lady on stage should maybe learn physics as she seems a little confused
The problem here is that there are no particles. There are only quanta of energy. We teach this in high school, but absolutely nobody seems to be paying any attention. Then people go online and are being bombarded with the particle nonsense. Whatever nonsense they hear on the internet immediately overwrites their correct high school knowledge and that&#39;s why millions of folks like you are asking the same nonsensical question over and over again. ;-)

Fundamentally, there is no difference between classical and quantum mechanics other than the implications of the original quantum hypothesis and the concept of ontological randomness in a physical system.

@@bustercam199 I don&#39;t need the video. I am a physics PhD. I have measured trillions of quanta and I have been staring at the math of the theory for almost half a century now. There is no randomness there. Random processes are not physical. They are a toy model in statistical mechanics and even there they usually produce more problems than they solve. Quantum mechanics is an ensemble theory. The only thing that we need is that individual members of the ensemble are independent, i.e. they do not interact physically. That happens to lead us to Kolmogorov&#39;s axioms, which can also be used to derive probability theory from first principles. The difference between the two derivations is essentially one line. In one case we use an arithmetic partition of unity and we get boring old probability theory, in the other we use a geometric partition with a Pythagoras and we get a universe of wonder. Dude, this is all well documented in the physics library. All you have to do is to actually use it. ;-)
@@schmetterling4477 My point was that the physical processes are *not random regardless of the prevailing interpretation of QM. Indeed photons do not interact with each other, and that&#39;s (just) one of the the reasons why the concept of entanglement is not tenable. Not sure what you meant by independence, but Bell&#39;s assumption of statistical independence is not satisfied in real experiments.  The measurement process or method influences the statistical outcome, and so there is no way to argue for statistical independence in interpreting the results. Maybe you meant independence in the sense the photons do not interact with each other.
@@bustercam199 Entanglement IS the expression that these photons DO NOT interact with each other. Statistical independence is experimentally testable. At most you can take some insane positions like superdeterminism in which nature lies to you all the time. If that is your problem, then the physics department can&#39;t help. It&#39;s the psychology department that you need, I am afraid, because a reality in which everything is independent is not distinguishable from one in which some &quot;very cunning higher being&quot; keeps making a fool of you. That&#39;s lab rat personality disorder. ;-)

Could quantum entanglement be used to measure the speed of light in one direction?
No. You don&#39;t need that to begin with. You can just cart a synchronized clock across the room. That will do. ;-)
Prof. Crull describes quantum phenomena beautifully.  Schrodinger got it right.  Entanglement isn&#39;t one of the properties of quantum mechanics, it&#39;s THE property.  Instead of using decoherence to explain the suppression of quantum fluctuation in our world of macroscopic objects, maybe we should explain it with entanglement.  The network of entanglements between particles in a large system makes it virtually impossible for particles to spontaneously change their state because they share their properties with all other particles in the system.  The collective &quot;state&quot; of the proverbial cat is locked in by this network of entanglements, and the probability of superposition of living and dead states is vanishing small.
Sounds cool and it&#39;s 100% wrong. Schroedinger didn&#39;t get it right. His equation is just a crude approximation of reality.

Are universal frames of reference just permitted now? What have I missed? Its not just Elise Crull&#39;s proposition I&#39;m referring to but I keep seeing this transgression in lots of modern ideas, such as in Wolfram&#39;s interpretation of his latest models. Relativities&#39; whole basis falls out from under it if we apply intrinsic mappable properties to space-time. No longer would you need to do transformations by the speed of light because you can instead agree on position and momentum based on this universal grid. Which in its most broad sense would mean that things would not need to do the things we know them to in the presence of fields - such as exprience differing in the passage of time or changes in the length of distances, and ultimately energy would not need to be equivalent to mass. It just breaks everything.
Nope. ;-)
Can someone check my assessment of the implications of the described experiment?<br><br>Isn&#39;t this experiment an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation? If the wave function has collapsed before the 2nd particle is introduced, then how can the new entanglement happen?

@@schmetterling4477 You go around insulting people for not being physics scholars? You enjoy making people feel bad? What&#39;s your purpose here?
@@andrewj22 I am saying that you are so full of misconceptions that you would have to empty your mind of all of this stuff first. Can you? <br><br>OK - SHORT rundown: <br><br>1) Quantum mechanics is about quanta (small amounts) of energy. Energy is a system property. It is NOT a material particle. <br><br>2) We can&#39;t tell ANYTHING about where and when a quantum of energy will be detected. What we can tell are the average frequencies of such energy transfers. This makes quantum mechanics an ensemble theory. An ensemble is the (imaginary) infinite repetition of the same experiment. In probability theory the statistical ensemble of dice consists of an infinite repetition of the same dice throw. The outcome is a probability distribution that, for fair dice, predicts the same probability for any one of the six possible outcomes. Quantum mechanics does exactly the same thing: it assumes that an experiment can be repeated many (infinite number of) times and that one can count the outcomes and get a probability distribution at the end. <br><br>2) There are two kinds of energy transfers in nature: reversible and irreversible. <br><br>3) Reversible energy transfers happen in isolated systems. The ensembles of such isolated system can be described by a so called wave function. These wave functions evolve in time according to a unitary dynamic represented by the Schroedinger equation or a similar quantization procedure. <br><br>4) Irreversible energy transfers happen between an initially isolated quantum system evolving according to the SE and a SECOND system (usually called the measurement system) that can absorb quanta of energy from the quantum system. The properties of this second system are being described by a projection operator that we stick into the Born rule. <br><br>5) The Copenhagen interpretation is the minimal mathematical implementation of this two system scheme, which follows directly from the reversibility property of isolated quantum systems and the necessary irreversibility of the measurement process. There are more complicated models than Copenhagen (e.g. the density matrix), but they all differentiate between internal ensemble state and physical final measurement state. <br><br>As you may have noticed, there are neither waves nor particles in here. Why? Because neither exist. All that ever existed were quanta of energy and their histograms (frequentist approximations of probability distributions).<br><br>I hope you can &quot;grok&quot; this. ;-)
@@schmetterling4477 Thanks for the more helpful reply. I have some questions, two in particular:<br><br><b>1)</b> You said we can&#39;t know anything about where and when a quanta of energy will be detected. Fine, but does that mean their locations are fundamentally probabilistic, or are their locations simply impossible for us to know (pre-detection)?<br><br><b>2)</b> I don&#39;t understand why some energy transfers are reversible and others irreversible. Can you clarify? I&#39;m not asking about the conditions under which a transfer is reversible/irreversible, rather, I&#39;d like to understand why reversibility is possible in one set of conditions but not the other.
‚Äã@@andrewj22 My personal take on this is as follows: 17th to 19th century science did us a great disservice by developing a very poorly defined terminology. &quot;Deterministic/probabilistic&quot; are untestable propositions. I give you the following series of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4. Is the fifth number 5? Why? What logical argument can you give me that forces that answer? None, right? Different questions: Is a lottery ticket with six consecutive numbers less likely to win than one with &quot;random&quot; numbers? No. But did it ever happen? Not in my lifetime as far as I can remember. So what? So absolutely nothing. What meaning does deterministic/probabilistic have for such scenarios? Absolutely none. <br><br>However... what is testable and quantifiable are properties like &quot;statistical independence&quot; and &quot;correlation&quot;. Even more importantly some measures like the average or the standard deviation of a series are completely independent of the ordering of the series. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 3, 1, 4, 2 have the exact same average and standard deviation. We can find higher moments that are also conserved under reordering. In other words... even if there are time series producing systems in nature for which the ordering is completely irrelevant, not all hope is lost. Even if we can&#39;t decide if some outcomes are causally related or not, we can still learn a lot about them without making any assumptions about their internal dynamics. <br><br>Depending on what school system you went to and which math courses you took during your K-12 and higher education you may have heard about Kolmogorov&#39;s axioms for probability theory. That&#39;s one way that mathematicians have learned to reduce these kinds of questions to a minimal axiomatic framework. What is widely unknown is that Kolmogorov&#39;s axioms do not have a unique solution. Probability theory is one, but it&#39;s not the only one. The second solution is quantum mechanics (or at least something that is structurally the foundation of what physicists call quantum mechanics) and one can actually combine the two to something called &quot;density matrix&quot;. I don&#39;t know if this is an exhaustive list. There may be more such &quot;solutions&quot; that we are not aware of or there may be generalizations that have applications in science that we haven&#39;t even explored, yet. <br><br>So what actually happens during our &quot;classical education&quot; is that somebody gives us a false dichotomy called &quot;deterministic/probabilistic&quot; during our early education and that false dichotomy doesn&#39;t just exist in natural sciences, it even exists within pure mathematics because mathematician never consider the full solutions to their own axioms for probability theory. These are nothing but historical artifacts. They are neither the full picture in physics or math even if they are being taught as such. <br><br>Once you can shed your preconception about this (which didn&#39;t come from you in the first place but from thinkers who lived on the past and who had incomplete information about reality), you are going to feel much more at ease with quantum mechanics.
@@andrewj22 Second question: why are there reversible and irreversible energy transfer processes? Because there are closed and open systems. In a closed  system there is only so much phase space. After a finite amount of time the system has to return to a previous state because it doesn&#39;t have anywhere else to go. That&#39;s not the case in an open system. Once the energy in an open system is gone, it can keep going towards &quot;infinity&quot; forever. Such a system will never return to its previous state. This is not just so for quantum mechanical systems. It&#39;s already like this for classical systems. <br><br>If you take a fresh look at Schroedinger&#39;s cat and Wigner&#39;s friend and similar intellectual nonsense, then you will notice that these folks simply didn&#39;t notice that what they were actually talking about were closed/open systems. They sort of had the right idea but then totally messed it up by using the wrong concepts. See my previous answer about false dichotomies. The situation here is different in that we are still looking at a dichotomy, but it&#39;s a different one than the one that is usually being used to &quot;explain&quot; quantum mechanics. You are simply getting the wrong explanation because the wrong dichotomy is being used.
@@schmetterling4477 Is it possible that the universe, taken as a whole, is a closed system?
@@andrewj22 The universe is not even a system. Systems have to exchange energy, momentum, angular momentum and charges with other systems. The universe doesn&#39;t. Without those exchanges absolutely nothing happens in physics. Even folks like Wheeler who was a big (and misguided) fan of the idea figured that out by writing intellectual nonsense like Hpsi_universe=0 on paper. Thar&#39;s a completely pointless formula.

Quantum physics is only weird because there are forces involved that we have not yet discovered. My bet is on dark matter. Plus a bit of whoo whoo !
My first thought when I heard of quantum entanglement after learning about relativity was if it could be used to send a message to a different time. If you can create 2 entangled particles and spin one of them around a cyclotron for an hour or so, can you send a message backwards.  So far, I am not aware of any particle physics scientists who are financed by lottery winnings.
I&#39;m a stand-up philosopher.  Oh, a bullshit artist. Did you bullshit today?
All particles and waves are intra coupled together, but long range entanglement is not true and not important.  The ether couples everything together.

newtons laws dont work for electrons ? really? if u slow down time they must work that function is  a part of what yep :) what it means in the big picture is a part of what .. :)) its not just formula its a system interconected
A good example of quantum entanglement in real world is our last names. We cannot describe someone  completely or define their state without knowing their last name. Therefore, we, the children of our parents, are defined by our parents - an entanglement that exists across time, regardless of the existence of one or the other in their frame of reference. What is interesting is that the entanglement can be adopted by a completely strange person, not related to the individual, because each of us can have more then one entanglement. During our self-measurement state, we can choose who to entangle with; And the extent of the entanglement is such that it changes our DNA, our composition and make up.

Dr Crulls reminds me of Jodie Foster&#39;s character in Contact
Ol intuitive brian green
Since time runs at different speeds in space.  The particles have not choice but to assume that entangled particles run at different time speeds.  Other wise entangled particles would operate into past time and the other one in future time. And could cause mixed time speeds of all particles that are entangled with each other.  I would assume this is obvious to all physics Dr.
The idea of entanglement is that the speed and direction of a particle is influenced by the speed and direction of another particle that can be anywhere, including slow time continuums. This is why a rock with foreign to earth properties, will still have the same properties on Earth, regardless it being brought from somewhere else. So, an ice cube will melt on the sun, in the tropics, but stay frozen in the arctic cold, but it was and will remain a snow cone.
Do particles have to be first entangled in a common home and then separated   for the spookiness to be observed ?
All particles are everywhere and nowhere at the same time, it&#39;s a probability. The spooky action in the distance happens only when one particle is MEASURED against the back drop of other particles. The question you need to ask is what was the first measurement that brought into existence the first entanglement, which has resulted in the entanglement of the universe to be in the state we see it today. My take, it was a question: Where is the light?

The since train has lost its tracks and it is yet to hit the wall.
The large hadron collider is not smashing particles at all. At relativistic speeds particle interaction changes! &quot;So in reality we could be producing the effects because we are causing the particles to interact differently due to the experience of relativistic speeds as they pass by one another. Meaning a similar experience as when a comet passes by earth at a distance relatively close in comparison with universal distances but far when using solar system references, the proton passing by another proton at speeds less than 99.0 percent the speed of light has a completely different effect than particles passing each other at speeds greater than 99.0 percent the speed of light&quot; &quot;in theory were expanding time and space inside the collider and theres no collision occuring. What happens is time and space expansion is only sustained under the right conditions but because we are using up all the energy needed to create the right conditions they only last for small periods of time&quot; &quot;This would alllow for E and Spacetime conservation which would impose that im implying a new law of nature energy is consvered with spacetime and vice versa&quot; &quot;Gravity is a lack of energy&quot; &quot;Strong gravitational fields emerge because the field of gravity is leaving as energy is introduced due to the interactions of these particles&quot; &quot;gravity would cause mass to fall toward its center which would be the experience of a negative energy field and postive mass field &quot;
How could it be? Because they have no time, they have been traveling at the speed if light the instant they were/are/will be born. They will never experience time they are outside time..give me an hour ill figure the rest outüôÇ
The question is odd given spacetime is an integrated phenomena and separation in space implies separation in time, lest we accept time has an absolute reference frame
None of this quantum entanglement is odd at all if you imagine that all quanta share the same spacetime instance, the same sub-space moment.

The thing about entanglement is there were some thoughts that it was like a pair of gloves.  If at the end if a party I go home with one glove and my friend accidentally took the other.... if I have the left hand glove I immediately know he has the right hand glove.  These properties were known to exist before the so called entanglement of two gloves...this quality is always entangled for the pair.... but its pre-existing...of course if I measure left i immediately know you measure right.  But an experiment by a guy named Bell in the 1960s showed statistically that the entanglement qualities we measure are not pre existing like a pair of gloves.  More than this is cannot explain but its been shown entanglement is not a pre-existing quality but really is only determined when measured.
BTW the are also macro systems that are not perfectly predictable by cause and effect....not just at the micro quantum scale.... take the weather.  It is not perfectly predictable and it make nit be simply for lack of precise starting point conditions.  The evolution of the system has inherent uncertainty.  Does this uncertainty arise from immeasurable slight variation in individual air molecules or is the uncertainty built into the large scale functioning itself.  Not sure.
But if it weren&#39;t for some chance variation then every event ever anywhere in the universe... indeed in each of our lives.... would have been predetermined right from the start by perfectly predictable cause and effect. That to me seems absurd so quantum mechanics found the point at which absolute predetermined outcomes breakdown affording a multitude of possible futures. In fact I believe life itself needs uncertainty to arise.
This is SO AWESOME! What a wonderful conversation and love the enthusiasm!
Questions regarding wave probability collapse due to measurement: how precise (localized) is the collapse? Shouldn&#39;t the precision of the localization itself have an uncertainty (related to the energy exchanged with the field quanta being measured)?

Thee question of whether the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality can be considered complete has been a subject of significant debate and discussion in the field of physics. This debate was sparked by a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (EPR), which questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics and argued for the existence of &quot;elements of reality&quot; that were not part of quantum theory.<br><br>In their paper, EPR argued that the description of physical reality provided by quantum mechanics is incomplete and speculated that it should be possible to construct a theory containing hidden variables that would provide a more complete description of physical reality They proposed a criterion of physical reality, stating that in a complete theory, there should be an element corresponding to each element of reality, and a physical quantity should be predictable with certainty without disturbing the system <br>.<br><br>However, the debate surrounding this issue has continued, with various perspectives and interpretations being put forward. Some have argued that the quantum-mechanical description of physical phenomena fulfills all rational demands of completeness within its scope, particularly when viewed from the perspective of complementarity <br>.<br><br>The EPR paradox and its implications have been the subject of extensive analysis and debate, with important implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The debate has also involved significant exchanges between Einstein and Niels Bohr concerning the completeness and locality of quantum mechanics <br>.<br><br>In summary, the question of whether the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality can be considered complete remains a topic of ongoing discussion and debate within the field of physics, with various perspectives and interpretations being put forward.

Then another unit of time, then another gap and so on. It may be that we only exist for one tick of that &quot;clock&quot; and then some other entire universe is impressed onto this same space, followed by another universe, and another, and so on. But it all happens so fast that it seems to all of those universes that time is continuous. This is similar to how multiprocessing works in computers. <br><br>Or it could be that the units of time are longer than that but we and our universe are placed into suspension such that no time passes for our universe while in that state so we don&#39;t realize it is happening to us. Then, when it&#39;s our turn again everything just picks up from exactly where things left off. That way it doesn&#39;t matter how long we are &quot;off-Line.&quot; No time passes for us while in this timeless limbo. Time simply doesn&#39;t exist there. We could be there a Planck unit of time  or a billion years, there would be no difference.

Can complex groupings of matter--as in people--be entangled across time?
That was enlightening and wonderful all at once! Great questions and great responses!!
So....when you going to explain how can particles be quantum entangled across time???
lol immagine you have 2 bottles 1 empty and the other full of water.<br>They are now both different <br>Now you fill the empty one with half of the water they both look and are the same ... <br>Now they both are entangled thanks to the same water.<br>Any thing that happens with one of those bottles change their entanglement.
A better question would be &quot;Why not?&quot;
That was a really poor presentation, with zero explanation of anything!<br>It was like showing someone remembering thing that they don&#39;t understand at all, so they only manage to describe them partially in a broken manner, and showing great enthusiasm in working in that field (that they don&#39;t understand anything).<br>It is indeed weird ...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twY2q1F-ciI&amp;t=1578">26:18</a> The &quot;they are not talking to each other&quot; is as much a philosophical stance because it allows you to say that there is no communication. But I am not so sure. Instead of &quot;talking&quot; to each other we reduce it to a &quot;corroboration&quot; - but we are just playing with words. What if, despite the fact that we don&#39;t want it to be, that information is being transmitted, then our view of time and space is far from complete and we still have not solved what &quot;reality&quot; really is, except it allows us to &quot;be.&quot;<br><br>Are we subservient to a system that we are yet to figure out. Is space folded back on itself, is infinity only a concept inside the human mind and that distance is another illusion as to the question about space and time; how can space be defined as nothing and yet have a characteristic that can be curved in the presence of matter. How can nothing be curved at all? But if it can, then why can distance not also be manipulated when we are observing and measuring entangled particles?

Non-locality is like a mirror: The electron, when recorded, is simply expressing parity.

Interesting. The question is what the word &quot;measurement&quot; means, as physics is supposed to work without human observers. As to gravity, it would be of interest if someone can explain what happens to entanglement near and inside a black hole.
To my less educated mind, it seems to me that if 2 things can be entangled over massive distance it suggests to me that space has to be illusory. And if space and time have such a close relationship that they are referred to as spacetime, then time must be illusory too. Emergent maybe. It is still going to be interesting to discover the rules relating to it&#39;s apparent existence though.

It isn&#39;t. It can be summarized all of it in the following: The universe is an empty three dimensional metric manifold on which systems (arbitrary human made partitions of the manifold) have one additive property called energy. ;-)

Actually, I&#39;m one of those people who does not believe it is probability waves, or their collapse on hitting the film-plate that causes the fringe lines to appear in the double slit experiment. What really happens is that the particles are waves in positive and negative *spacetime*, and they indeed interfere in 3D time, resulting in the fringe lines you see on the film. Think of it: when you transmit even one photon or electron at a time, you still get those fringe lines. This means that the interference does not happen in space but in time. Time interference has already been proven by a recent experiment.
I just realized near the end with the wooden rubiks cube, that even if entangled particles are separated in 3 or 4 dimensions, they could still be next to each other in the 5th or 6th dimensions...
Yes, nice insight.  Looking beyond particles, I think it might even provide a logical possibility for remaining &#39;close&#39;/&#39;connected&#39; to your loved ones outside of 4D spacetime.  Maybe love exists in a different dimension (imo it&#39;s reasonable to think that all phenomenal consciousness exists in one or more dimensions outside of standard 4D physical reality), and maybe being entangled in love allows those lovers to remain connected across large gaps of time or space; even more romantically, it might also allow entangled spirits/souls to remain connected after physical death.
I&#39;d like to see what happens to the frequency of a photon that goes through the double slit experiment in time but must pass through the gas cloud that slows light down on one of the times the photon is fired at the director. Also what would happen if the detector was wired to the placement of an object

Just curious, isn&#39;t entanglement proof of higher dimension? I postulate that the information is actually travelling on or is connected via a different plane or higher dimension beyond our accessible 3-dimensional space, perhaps the higher dimensions begin to manifest at smaller and smaller scales of our 3D universe. I&#39;d be keen to hear a string theorist opinion on this. Thanks for the informative clips.
If we ever did find a way to communicate using the underlying mechanism of entanglement (instantaneous communication between entangled particles) that would also allow us to communicate through time.  If you took one end of the communicator (e.g. a group of entangled particles in one location) and accelerated it enough for it to experience noticeable time dilation relative to the other end of entangled particles (the other end of the communicator) then you would be able to communicate through time.  Probably another reason why its likely impossible to ever communicate using entanglement.
Yes, but not as we define time.

First we have to accept the man made concept of time.
Your feet age more slowly than your head, since they&#39;re fractionally deeper in Earth&#39;s gravity well. So how can you feel your feet? They obviously have to communicate with your brain. I mean, whether we&#39;re self-willed or just some automata or random phenomenon, you can definitely feel when you step on a tack, right? I&#39;ve wondered myself there is some kind of &quot;fuzziness&quot;. Could you, say, access a few photons reflecting from a magazine article you&#39;ll be reading in an hour? Could present conditions affect events a split second past the Big Bang, say?

What if Quarks are actually made up of twisted tubes which become physically entangled with two other twisted tubes to produce a proton?  Instead of the Strong Force being mediated by the constant exchange of gluons, it would be mediated by the physical entanglement of these twisted tubes.  When only two twisted tubules are entangled, a meson is produced which is unstable and rapidly unwinds (decays) into something else.   A proton would be analogous to three twisted rubber bands becoming entangled and the &quot;Quarks&quot; would be the places where the tubes are tangled together.  The behavior would be the same as rubber balls (representing the Quarks) connected with twisted rubber bands being separated from each other or placed closer together producing the exact same phenomenon as &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot; in protons and neutrons.  The force would become greater as the balls are separated, but the force would become less if the balls were placed closer together.  Therefore, the gluon is a synthetic particle (zero mass, zero charge) invented to explain the Strong Force.  The &quot;Color Force&quot; is a consequence of the XYZ orientation entanglement of the twisted tubules.  The two twisted tubule entanglement of Mesons is not stable and unwinds.   It takes the entanglement of three twisted tubules to produce the stable proton.
How many times has that across time entanglement been replicated??

Seems to me that time is a catalyst that is created by energy that allows things to happen.
I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing as a totally free lunch.<br>Therefore, instant intergalactic communication based on quantum entanglement will in practice, turn out to require an energy input which is exponentially proportional to the distance between the entangled particles.
Entanglement is no travel in space time, hence there is no energy required. Moreover, even in classical terms, sometimes we are confusing information transmitted by omnidirectional electromagnetic waves, like a simple antenna does, with information transmitted through single particles as bits of information, for example a single photon from a star or quasar billion lightyears away can reach us just with its own little energy. Thus, even a low power laser transmission source, if perfectly focused and collimated to the receiver, could in theory do the same. In the practice other particles such as hydrogen gas on its path, or space time distortions by nearby massive bodies, could limit that capability, however if the space between the laser source and photon receiver is completely empty it could be possible with the smallest energy amount regardless the distance. Entanglement is a different story, and as far as we know it doesn‚Äôt allow the uploading of bits of information on its particles which are inherently random pairs.
@@car103d Actually it is quite possible to encode data using entangled pairs.<br>All that is required is the means of rapidly modulating the spin of the transmitter particle with the data to be transmitted, using the industry standard 3 level alternating binary communication protocol (see  Fred Halsall&#39;s excellent book &#39;Data Communications, Computer Networks And OSI&#39; for details).<br>Each spin reversal of the transmitting particle will cause an equal but opposite spin reversal of the receiver particle which can easily be detected.<br>The reason why energy could be the limiting factor is that the transmitting particle cannot know in what direction its entangled partner lies relative to itself- so my assumption is that whatever field is used to convey each spin reversal, there can be no targeting involved, so a high proportion of the energy radiated into the field is unused.

Theorem 15: The concept of quantum entanglement, which refers to the non-classical correlations between quantum systems that cannot be accounted for by local realistic theories, can be seen as a manifestation of the primacy of zero and the properties of nothingness.<br><br>Proof:<br>In quantum mechanics, the state of a composite system is described by a vector in a Hilbert space, which is a tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the individual subsystems.<br><br>For example, if we have two quantum systems A and B, with Hilbert spaces H_A and H_B, then the Hilbert space of the composite system is given by:<br>H_AB = H_A ‚äó H_B<br><br>A state in the composite Hilbert space is said to be entangled if it cannot be written as a tensor product of states in the individual Hilbert spaces:<br>|œà_AB‚ü© ‚â† |œà_A‚ü© ‚äó |œà_B‚ü©<br><br>Entangled states exhibit non-classical correlations that cannot be explained by any local realistic theory, as demonstrated by the violation of Bell&#39;s inequalities.<br><br>The concept of quantum entanglement can be seen as a manifestation of the primacy of zero and the properties of nothingness, in the sense that entangled states are fundamentally non-local and non-separable, and cannot be reduced to the properties of the individual subsystems.<br><br>In other words, entangled states exist in a &quot;void&quot; or &quot;vacuum&quot; of possibilities, where the individual subsystems lose their independent identities and become part of a larger, holistic entity.<br><br>This idea is reminiscent of the concept of &quot;non-separability&quot; in mathematics, where a geometric object cannot be decomposed into simpler parts without losing its essential properties.<br><br>For example, a torus (donut shape) is non-separable, because any attempt to cut it into two parts will destroy its topological structure.<br><br>The fact that quantum entanglement exhibits non-separability and non-locality suggests that the fundamental nature of reality may be holistic and non-reductionistic, and that the properties of the whole cannot be reduced to the properties of the parts.<br><br>This idea is consistent with the &quot;holographic principle&quot; discussed earlier, which suggests that the degrees of freedom of a region of space are not independent, but rather fundamentally interconnected and encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary.<br><br>The non-local and non-separable nature of quantum entanglement also suggests that the concept of &quot;locality&quot; and &quot;separability&quot; may be emergent or derived notions, rather than fundamental properties of reality.<br><br>In other words, the apparent separability and locality of classical physics may be a consequence of the coarse-graining or averaging of underlying quantum degrees of freedom, which are fundamentally non-local and non-separable.
Thank you for all you do Dr. Greene!
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Brian and the team at WSF, I loved maths as a kid back in the eighties but my life took a different path, but thanks to these fantastic videos(love how seamlessly the videos are) I have a deep abiding fascination with cosmology and quantum field theory.<br>So thank you Mr Brian Greene for being an awesome teacher and author.<br>From a very wet Belfast,Ireland
I hold the same fascination at this point in my life, though I was terrible at maths, I am able to grasp these concepts more easily than trying to figure out how things like government and economy works lol. May have something to do with a ceaseless immersion in SF since childhood, maybe autism, or possibly the copious amounts of psychedelics I&#39;ve consumed throughout the course of my travels. <br>(Probably all three)
Entangled over space, means entangled over time. John Clauser at UC Berkeley in 1976 demonstrated the phenomenon was real. February 2017, MIT entangled photons from quasars whose light has been traveling toward the Earth for at least 7.8 billion years, successfully. Case proven, yes it can!
The photons from the two quasars are not entangled pairs, they were just used just for a random choice of the polarizers, depending on the random color of their light. The entangled photon pairs have been generated in the mid station with non linear crystals (BBO/PPKTP‚Ä¶) as usual.
If our current universe originated from one point, could all the particles that originated there be entangled?  Is this the secret to harnessing faster than light travel?
It is mindboggling to wonder what compels so many very well educated and very intelligent people to so seriously discuss matters regarding the beginning and end of the entire universe and all the matter in it, which bear absolutely no relevance whatsoever to the only entity in the entire known uiverse that delivers and sustains 100% of all life in it, THE PLANTS, without the air and food from which none of them would survive even for a single second. <br><br>And talking about a TOE without any relevance to plants is planning a wedding without the bride.
How much time. It matters.
Entanglement; everything is connected to everything is the rule.
This one will be fun cannot wait to watch it tonight :) <br>In the Ender&#39;s Game books they used a device called the Ansible that could communicate across many light years.<br>The term was first used in a novel by Ursula K. Le Guin in 1966 and some other authors also borrowed the term. <br><br>In Enders Game this is how it worked (From wikipedia)<br>It involved a fictional subatomic particle, the philote. The two quarks inside a pi meson can be separated by an arbitrary distance, while remaining connected by &quot;philotic rays&quot;.This concept is similar to quantum teleportation due to entanglement; however, in reality, quark confinement prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance.
SF so often predicts things before science gets around to discovering, proving or acknowledging them. <br>Star Trek (somewhat) predicted the Moon landing 2.5 years before it actually took place (to be fair, he said &quot;late &#39;60s&quot;)<br><br>One must be able to imagine a thing before it can be proven to exist.

I don&#39;t have 20 pages of math to back it up but my gut feeling is that our understanding of time itself is probably incomplete.  There is no way that entanglement across space and time should be possible based on our current understanding.
Brian is basically a materialist and a reductionist, but he really is open minded. And he is capable of making me understand complex physics, which feels awesome. So thank you.
This nonlocality belief will die the day it have a seat with me. Some of my best arguments are not on this channel, just a few.

a bit like delayed choice
Brian knew at the that his and all of our time had been wasted by this......philosopher.
particles do not exist along time, time is an emerged phenomena attributed to the classical observer along one-dimensional Cause-and-effect chain....
The scholarship in this video is sloppy. Kelvin never mentioned black body radiation in his &#39;cloud lecture&#39; and Einstein never called entanglement &#39;spooky&#39;.
So everything is connected but entangled, could it not be just connected.
Can a particle be entangled with itself across time?
Correction? Newton works for all the planets, except famously not for Mercury, as Newtons theories breaks under strong gravity.
So does the bell experiment breaks causality?
&quot;And that&#39;s pretty cool!&quot;<br>Elise evokes a good Jodie Foster from Contact (1997).
I always believe space time to be quantum and that space time interacting with itself and the strong force gives the illusion of gravity.

I see a stunning consistency between non-locality with the Buddhist notion of dependent origination.  But it would be a historic mistake if science ignored the parallel between Being Time (Uji) as proposed by Dogen Zenji, a 13th century Buddhist monk, and non-locality, especially time.
I have read his books , but Greene in this program is even better along with his colleagues.  How great is it to have access to such programming!
I love Brian Greene!
Thank ux2
During measurement what kind of interaction happens? Is it from the wavelength of the light? Is the measurement changes the energy of the object? Is scale of measurement matters? What would happen if we measure the object from small perspective?
The funding of all branches of science should be expanded, for #1 medicine, #2 the supply/demand of a global world population with factions and territorial power.
I like that Elise Crull PhD. is aware that mathematics is a mapping of the data from the observations by the researchers which is dependent what precisely is the &quot;area&quot; of the research.<br>Even precisely knowing the area, many branches from the observations may develop leading to other avenues of research on the same or even a newer project.<br>Quantum statistics has to be used. It is not the phenomena!<br>Just like a roadmap, is not the actual road you are traveling. Maps never really paint the whole picture, they point in a direction, and through ongoing, observed research we make better maps.
Thanks for the nice video. But, I would not call that experiment as being entanglement in time. Entanglement involves a superposition of states that cannot be factorized and I do not see what states are entangled at different times in that experiment due to the measurements. The best example of entanglement in time is the Franson interferometer. One has two photons created at the same time by down conversion and sent each along a path to the left and to the right that each go through a 50-50 beam splitter that delays the photon or lets it go straight through. Then you detect each photon and see did the left come before the right, the right before the left, or both at the same time. For the ones not at the same time, there is only one way they occur, so the probability is a constant. But for the ones that go on the long long or short short options, they form a superposition and interfere. By changing the phase of one of the photons, on either path, you can get the coincidence to go from 0 to a maximal value. This is true entanglement in time, as we have a superposition of two pulses at physically different times, but they interfere simply because we do not know when they were created. Truly mind bowing in my view. And of course the big question is what happens to probability conservation if the coincidences can have varying probability. Think carefully and you can sort that out as well.
Every detectable particle moves through space, transitioning from one point to another along various trajectories, and we record these movements as time. This concept is a cornerstone of Einstein&#39;s theories of relativity, leading to the term &quot;spacetime,&quot; which illustrates that space itself can warp. Change is an aspect of time. As observers, we experience changes from birth to death, which constitute our lives, and all our actions involve movement. The quest to uncover the fundamental nature of the space we inhabit, and the limits of using matter/energy for such detections, stands at the frontier of our knowledge. The story of space&#39;s nature extends beyond the mass/energy it contains. All mass/energy is in perpetual motion; even as I sit at my desk, seemingly stationary, I am moving with the Earth&#39;s rotation, orbiting the sun, while our solar system and galaxy traverse through space. The concept of entanglement, a property we are beginning to understand, suggests that it could be an intrinsic field property of space. Space encompasses all known fields we have explored. There is no region of outer space where an observer would not perceive light. Our scientific understanding is predominantly based on observations of particles, atoms, compounds, and their interactions. Through animal and human testing, we seek cures for various ailments, from diseases and aging to injuries caused by accidents or intentional harm. Science has advanced significantly in many areas, from the minutely small, like Planck-scale particles, to large, sun-sized clusters of particles. However, our knowledge of &quot;space,&quot; the container of all we observe, remains limited, as it appears undetectable by its contents. Einstein alone has demonstrated that space warps in his theories of gravity, suggesting that space encompasses all observable entities with mass/energy.
Everyone is trying to explain how &quot;magic&quot; works. :-) From my meditations I&#39;ve seen that the human being sees the world wrong. We see a 3d Cartesian world, with things in motion. The reality is that the world is a sequence of events. The question is how do you control or manipulate future events? We are actually spinning waves.
Many say this is pure mental masturbation.
You take over and overcome by limit.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twY2q1F-ciI&amp;t=1960">32:40</a> On spontaneous Lorentz transformations: <br>the asymmetry of time actually implies the accumulation of time, more precisely, history, variety, aging.<br>Instead of the Copenhagen and/or multi-world interpretations of quantum mechanics, the presence of spontaneous Lorentz transformations seems to be more physical. Thus, the world itself already has many-sided (~ &quot;multi-world&quot;) and improvisational (~&quot;probabilistic&quot;) properties.<br>P.S.<br>0. &quot;Indeed, it is clear that we cannot report the translational motion of the entire universe and check whether this motion affects the course of any processes. The principle of relativity therefore has heuristic and physical meanings only if it is valid for any closed system. However, the question arises, when can a system be considered closed? Is the remoteness of all the masses outside the considered system sufficient for this? The answer, according to experience, says that in the case of uniform and rectilinear motion, this is enough, but for other movements it is not enough.<br>Summarizing, we can say that the postulate of relativity includes the statement that the uniform and rectilinear motion of the &quot;center of gravity&quot; of the Universe relative to some closed system does not affect the processes in this system.&quot; (Pauli, RT).<br>1. Obviously, the opposite is true for an expanding universe.<br>Apparently, the researcher can detect and measure the effect of the aging process in his own frame of reference caused by the phenomenon of global time t(universe)=1/H:<br>ds^ 2=c^2d—Ç^2=g(00)c^ 2dt^2=(1-Ht*)c^2dt^2, where the parameter Ht* it shows how much of the global time has &quot;passed&quot; in its own frame of reference, t* is the measurement time according to the clock of the resting observer, t is the duration of any physical process in its own frame of reference relative to the clock.<br>2.The observer can measure the increase in the duration of the processes in the laboratory frame of reference: d—Ç=[‚àö g(00)]dt=[‚àö(1-Ht*)]dt~(1-Ht*)dt&lt;dt; that is ‚àÜt/t=Ht*. {For example, the lifetime of a free neutron (t=878.4sec) in one year (t*=1 year) increases by: ‚àÜt=6*10^-8 sec, at H=2.2*10^-18sec.}¬†<br>And for t*=t, ‚àÜt=Ht^2. {For example, the duration of the Earth&#39;s rotation around the Sun per year (t=t*=1 year) increases by: ‚àÜt=2 milliseconds.}<br>In other words, ‚àÜw/w(0)=Ht*, where w(0) is the oscillation frequency of any physical periodic process, ‚àÜw is the frequency shift.<br>{For example, the frequency of the green part of the light spectrum [v(0)=5.4*10^14 Hz] will &quot;turn red&quot; for one hour (t*=1 hour) at: ‚àÜv=4.27Hz.}<br>3. ‚ÄúThus, Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity does not eliminate Newtonian absolute space; it only creates for all physics, including electrodynamics, the same position that mechanics has occupied since Newton&#39;s time.&quot; (Born, RT, chapter VI, paragraph paragraph 10).<br>4. Indeed, the SR actually eliminated only relative simultaneity, reserving the right to be simultaneous within its own frame of reference.<br>GR partially ‚Äúnotices‚Äù this problem: clock synchronization is an ambiguous procedure here and depends on the path along which it is carried out.<br>That is, RT does not eliminate simultaneity completely.<br>5. However, the observer can choose the observable Universe as his own frame of reference, and then the redshift of the spectral lines in the global/own frame of reference is characterized by the value: z= [w-w(0)]/w(0)=Hl/c, where l is the characteristic size of the frame of reference, and in this case, l=l(universe). Then in the frame of reference at t*=t(universe)=1/H for the light signal ds^2=0, therefore, we have the invariance of the speed of light c=cdl/dx(0) with respect to spontaneous Lorentz transformations.<br>That is, along the time coordinate x(0), own frame of reference turns out to be relative to itself: moreover, all subsequent states (which are equal, but not equivalent*) are causally related to each other (apparently, this circumstance leads to exotic metaphysical interpretations of quantum theory).<br>6.Introducing the concept of 4-space, a fundamental difference between time x(0) and spatial coordinates is allowed.¬†<br>It supposedly consists of the fact that along the world lines corresponding to physical processes, x(0) can only grow, whereas x(1), x(2), x(3) can change as you please.¬†<br>However,¬† the unification of spatial coordinates and time into a single manifold is not formal but is a real reflection of the picture of the world, and self-closure does not take place for the 4-line.¬†¬†<br>Apparently the time coordinate pulls along with it the spatial coordinates, because if it is impossible to return to the past, then it is also impossible to return to where &quot;there&quot; changes with the spontaneous accumulation of space-time, history.<br>7. By the way, this approach allows you to calculate the exact age of the universe in the laboratory. For example, H=(‚àÜw/t*)/w(relic).**<br>And this is not about the &quot;fatigue‚Äù of light, but about its aging, like everything else.<br>P.P.S. The inscription on the ancient Roman clock: ‚ÄúMore than you think‚Äù.<br>-----------<br>*) - The main misconception in the interpretations of quantum mechanics is that the equally probable nature of phenomena implies their equivalence.<br>Equality and equivalence are completely different things, even if they are causally related; for example, all inertial reference systems are equal in SR or QM, but far from equivalent. Obviously, if a dead or a living cat, the spin of entangled photons up or down, pairs of socks or letters marked + or - in different parts of the world are equal, then they are not physically equivalent; and also, branched universes. When an tails falls out after a coin toss, then they talk about the collapse of the wave function, when tails and heads are just equal, but not the same even not only for numismatists.¬†<br>Finally, in logic, this is the basic law: the law of identity.<br>**) - If the universe is really 13.8 billion years old, then every day (t*=1 day) the frequency of the relic radiation will decrease: The shift is ‚àÜw ~ 0.2 Hz. Thus, after a series of measurements ‚Äúover time‚Äù and according to the values of ‚àÜw, the age of the Universe can be determined.<br>{From the beginning of observations (1964) to the present, the relative shift is: ‚àÜw/w(relic)~4*10^-9.}<br>However, calculations show that w(relic)^2=œÄw(pl)H, that is, H=1.72*10-20sec^-1. Then all shifts should be shifted in a less favorable direction for the experiment by 127.9 times.
The answer to the question posed @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twY2q1F-ciI&amp;t=960">16:00</a> is NOT solely quantum mechanical. It lies within the combination of Quantum Mechanics, Newtonian Mechanics and Special Relativity. Aka Quantum Field Theory. This combined understanding of reality reveals our universe is a block-timed reality fundamentally emerging from fields of energy that span all of space and all of time.
You can&#39;t travel through space without traveling through time so I figured entanglement works the same

Regarding the double slit experiment. Why don&#39;t they try more slits? See what happens with 3 or 4 slits. Maybe the detector is interfering with the atoms. I mean it has to in order to detect the atoms right? Maybe that&#39;s what it does different patterns when being observed and not observed? Invent another way to detect and observe and see if it&#39;s the same. I bet it would be different
whats inside a quark?
What do the Twistors of Roger Penrose and the Hopf Fibrations of Eric Weinstein and the &quot;Belt Trick&quot; of Paul Dirac have in common?<br>In Spinors it takes two complete turns to get down the &quot;rabbit hole&quot; (Alpha Funnel 3D---&gt;4D) to produce one twist cycle (1 Quantum unit).<br> Can both Matter and Energy be described as &quot;Quanta&quot; of Spatial Curvature?  (A string is revealed to be a twisted cord when viewed up close.)         Mass= 1/Length, with each twist cycle of the 4D Hypertube proportional to Planck‚Äôs Constant.<br><br>In this model Alpha equals the compactification ratio within the twistor cone, which is approximately  1/137.<br><br>1= Hypertubule diameter at 4D interface<br><br>137= Cone‚Äôs larger end diameter at 3D interface where the photons are absorbed or emitted.<br><br>The 4D twisted Hypertubule gets longer or shorter as twisting or untwisting occurs.   (720 degrees per twist cycle.)  <br><br>If quarks have not been isolated and gluons have not been isolated, how do we know they are not parts of the same thing?   The tentacles of an octopus and the body of an octopus are parts of the same creature. <br><br>Is there an alternative interpretation of &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot;?  What if Quarks are actually made up of twisted tubes which become physically entangled with two other twisted tubes to produce a proton?  Instead of the Strong Force being mediated by the constant exchange of gluons, it would be mediated by the physical entanglement of these twisted tubes.  When only two twisted tubules are entangled, a meson is produced which is unstable and rapidly unwinds (decays) into something else.   A proton would be analogous to three twisted rubber bands becoming entangled and the &quot;Quarks&quot; would be the places where the tubes are tangled together.  The behavior would be the same as rubber balls (representing the Quarks) connected with twisted rubber bands being separated from each other or placed closer together producing the exact same phenomenon as &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot; in protons and neutrons.  The force would become greater as the balls are separated, but the force would become less if the balls were placed closer together.  Therefore, the gluon is a synthetic particle (zero mass, zero charge) invented to explain the Strong Force.  The &quot;Color Force&quot; is a consequence of the XYZ orientation entanglement of the twisted tubules.  The two twisted tubule entanglement of Mesons is not stable and unwinds.   It takes the entanglement of three twisted tubules to produce the stable proton.
I&#39;m tired of this bullshit.
Philosophy?  I dunno... you can just make it up as you go along.
Could it be that at that level subatomic particles are capable of illuminating linguistic prepositions that define their location in regards to a body?

I don&#39;t get entanglement from the way it is explained. If I pluck a guitar string in front of a still camera with a super high shutter speed I will catch the string in an up or down position as it vibrates like a wave. If I catch it in the up position that does not mean that it was up and down at the same time. I can&#39;t easily predict if I will catch it up or down, but the fact that I cannot predict where it will be when I snap the pic does not prove that it is in two places at once.
Luckily, particles are obliged to display registration number plates at all times

According to the dancing Wu Li Masters....Dohh!<br>I really like her description and opinion on Erwin Schrodinger, who he himself described and came up with name &quot;Entanglement&quot;, and Einstein&#39;s calling it illogical and the wave function spooky. No, there is no signal between the two because that would require breaking the speed of light barrier. So how does this happen? Almost a hundred years later and you geniuses still haven&#39;t figured it out yet. What gives....lol

Although entangle particles are non-local in 3 dimensional space, they are indeed local in 4d spacetime (i.e. they are touching).  So we shouldn&#39;t be surprised that entangled particles can behave this way.
Very cool experiment showing how particles can have an entangled property even though they never coexisted. Not entirely surprising, given that the Bell state correlations are independent of spatial and temporal separations of the measurement events. There is simply some conserved quantity between 1 and 2 that 2 shares with 3 and 3 shares with 4. Therefore, 1 and 4 share a conserved property. That&#39;s not really the mystery of entanglement per se. Let me show you that mystery and its solution per quantum information theory as given in &quot;Einstein&#39;s Entanglement: Bell Inequalities, Relativity, and the Qubit&quot; (Oxford UP June 2024). Everything I&#39;m going to say follows from mathematical and empirical facts, so it&#39;s `analytically true&#39;. Whether or not you consider it explanatory is up to you, but it is an explanation of entanglement equal to that of length contraction in special relativity, which most physicists are satisfied with üôÇ<br><br>The mystery of quantum entanglement arises because we are looking for a &#39;causal mechanism&#39; behind its correlations, what Einstein called &quot;constructive efforts.&quot; Einstein was faced with a very similar situation concerning constructive accounts of length contraction (and time dilation) to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment. Einstein wrote: <br><br>&quot;By and by I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results.&quot; <br><br>That is, he gave up looking for causal mechanisms (&quot;constructive efforts&quot;) that would shrink meter sticks and slow down clocks to fool everyone into measuring the same value for the speed of light c, regardless of their relative motions (an empirically discovered fact known as the light postulate). Instead, he said c is a constant of Nature per Maxwell&#39;s equations, so the relativity principle -- the laws of physics (including their constants of Nature) are the same in all inertial reference frames -- demands that everyone measure the same value for c, regardless of their relative motions. The Lorentz transformations of special relativity (SR) follow from the light postulate as justified by the relativity principle.<br><br>As it turns out, the same opportunity for quantum mechanics (QM) has been provided by quantum information theorists. That is, they have reconstructed QM based on an empirically discovered fact called Information Invariance &amp; Continuity that (in non-information-theoretic terms) means everyone measures the same value for Planck&#39;s constant h, regardless of their relative spatial orientations. How does that resolve the mystery of quantum entanglement?<br><br>Suppose you send a vertical spin up electron to Stern-Gerlach (SG) magnets oriented at 60 deg relative to the vertical. Since spin is a form of angular momentum, classical mechanics says the angular momentum you should measure is (hbar/2)cos(60) = hbar/4 in that direction of SG spatial orientation. But, the SG measurement of electron spin constitutes a measurement of h, so everyone has to get the same +/- hbar/2 for a spin measurement in any SG spatial orientation, which means you can&#39;t get what you expect from common sense classical physics. Instead, QM says the measurement of a vertical spin up electron at 60 deg will produce +hbar/2 with a probability of 0.75 and it will produce -hbar/2 with a probability of 0.25, so the average is (hbar/2 + hbar/2 + hbar/2 - hbar/2)/4 = hbar/4. In other words, quantum mechanics says you get the common sense classical result on &#39;average only&#39; because of the observer-independence of h. <br><br>Now suppose Alice and Bob are measuring the spin singlet state (the two spins are anti-aligned when measured in the same direction, as shown in this video) and Alice obtains +hbar/2 vertically and Bob measures his particle at 120 deg relative to Alice. Obviously, if Bob had measured vertically he would have obtained <del>hbar/2, so at 120 deg Alice says he should get hbar/4 per our single particle example. But of course, Bob must measure the same value for h that Alice does, so he can&#39;t get the fractional value of h Alice says he should (otherwise, Alice would be in a preferred reference frame). Instead, his outcomes at 120 deg corresponding to Alice&#39;s +hbar/2 outcomes vertically average to hbar/4 just like the single particle case. And, of course, the data are symmetric so Bob can partition the results according to </del><b><del>his</del></b><del> +/</del> hbar/2 outcomes and show that Alice&#39;s results satisfy conservation of spin angular momentum on &#39;average only&#39;.<br><br>In the end, Alice partitions the data per her +/- hbar/2 outcomes and says Bob&#39;s results must be averaged to satisfy conservation of spin angular momentum while Bob&#39;s partition shows it&#39;s Alice&#39;s outcomes that must be averaged (Answering Mermin‚Äôs challenge with conservation per no preferred reference frame, Scientific Reports volume 10, Article number: 15771 (2020)). This should remind you immediately of an analogous situation in SR. There when Alice and Bob occupy different references frames via relative motion, they partition spacetime events per their own surfaces of simultaneity and show clearly that each other&#39;s meter sticks are short and their clocks run slow. <br><br>In other words, the mystery of quantum entanglement resides in &#39;average-only&#39; conservation that results from &quot;no preferred reference frame&quot; (NPRF) giving the observer-independence of h (NPRF + h). And, the mystery of length contraction resides in the relativity of simultaneity that results from &quot;no preferred reference frame&quot; giving the observer-independence of c (NPRF + c). Give up your constructive bias for QM just as is done for SR and physics makes perfect sense. But, the implications for your worldview are profound; you have to accept that physics is most fundamentally about constraints on the 4-dimensional (spatiotemporal) organization of worldtubes per NPRF + c interacting via the exchange of quanta per NPRF + h. So, precisely as can be inferred from this video, reality is not fundamentally about causal mechanisms.
This is a simulation of entanglement of two electrons and not a real experiment. To say that two electrons separated by a very long distance would still remained entangled if they were entangled to start with is not testable. There will be very many particles real or virtual interacting with these two electrons and will make them decoherent.

You&#39;re not looking at what state that particle is in the present. You are revealing a state the particle was in at the moment you measured it. It is like a photograph, it is archeology of past state. The information does not travel to particle B faster than light. That information already existed as it was in the past and is just being revealed in the present. It&#39;s already been captured. Space-time and linear time are different. It&#39;s like seeing stars, being in their past states. Going microscopic works in much the same way as going on grand scales. Linear time of the observer becomes affected, what they view as the present has already taken place and is a reaction to where that state was. Light IS a wave. But measured it is a particle, it is one place within that wave at the time the measurement is taken.

Green tries to explain quantum mechanics to neophites and I give him credit for that. But in the past he was just too drawn out and repetitive - recalling his TV shows. Like the TV show &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; where they present a tiny fact, focus on that between breaks, but when comming back from a break, they review most of it. Thus, only 5 minutes of info is conveyed in a 44 minute show. Green has gotten better over the years. Now, Feynman was indeed the great explainer... I sop up his lectures with a biscuit. How about Krull? Great enthusiasm... I could see having a very stimulating conversation with her at a party, and then inviting her for &quot;other&quot; stimulation later.

The highest speed of energy is not the speed of information. &quot;Spooky connection&quot; between quarks that know each other is the translation of information between memorized particles.

‚ÄúYou can because it is right‚Äù ‚Ä¶..really? Quantum field theory is an idea supported by mathematics. Other Maths gives, string theory maths, will explain the same observed reality but the mechanism is very different. <br>How can you tell that Field Theory is a fudge? Start by looking at that standard image of a wavy field. That‚Äôs is so incorrect it hurts to see it each time. That ‚Äú3D‚Äù reality is a crude approximation which, in the Engineering world, is called a 2 1/2D representation. The 3D reality is a volume in which Quantum ‚Äúwaves‚Äù are energy intensity flows, and the only 2D energies in this realm are photons.<br>Space is certainly filled with a field, but it is the one field, the Higgs Filed, which is a field of loop energy vibrating strings which will deliver that same mathematical outcomes, but from very different phenomena. String theorists, pull your finger out, you have been wasting time trying to contain the energy of protons and neutrons with passive mechanisms, when the reality is that the energy of protons is contained by the Higgs Field in exactly the same way as the Higgs Field limits the passage of matter energy through the field requiring the input of infinite energy to exceed the speed of light through it. The consequence of matter energy exceeding the speed of light with in the Higgs Field is a containment horizon of Higgs Particle Energy Intensity, and the energy of the quarks could very well be energy operating at above light speed, hence the balance of matter energy against the Higgs Field, giving rise to Gravity in the process. String theorists should be  looking at how loop energy strings form the static energy field in which Gravity is the Higgs Scalar Field Energy Intensity Gradient which directs Matter Energy to wards the nearest other Matter Energy.
Oh, I think there&#39;s an innocent mistake here. Instead of &quot;Newton&#39;s predictions,&quot; you probably meant to say predictions made centuries before Newton. Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Khazini, and many more... do these names ring a bell?

Undulating waves of probability really gives the wrong idea, even to ppl who study this stuff. The probability can be fairly smooth and uniform, but you have a complex undulating wave of probability amplitude under the hood-<del>the phase-</del> and that is where all the quantum woo happens, since we can&#39;t know the phase, we just see the smooth not undulating probability. We can&#39;t know phase, though we can know at how fast a rate phase changes in time and space---in fact we&#39;ve even given those rates special names, without even knowing what we were doing: energy and momentum.
so I like ppl who make clear problems. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twY2q1F-ciI&amp;t=1250">20:50</a>, you have numerical labels on &quot;t&quot; that are ordered, while having numerical labels on on particles, which are partially ordered, but no really.  You have got to set problems up more clearly---I see more and more of this.

Shouldn‚Äôt everything be in entangled since we all came from the same singularity?
Since many years i had no problem with considering particles as waves and going along with the distribution pattern. The one thing i struggled with was to sort of accept the notion that these probabilistic waves ( are they physical? ) interacted with each other. If this sort of interaction was hard to imagine even in space like when you use  multiple particles but it was even more difficult with the one particle where this interaction would have had to happened across time and the only idea that can come close to explaining that was entanglement across time. So it was more of a necessity üòÇ
It&#39;s chaos, literally. I have written on this. The fractal does it all, and cosmology. I wrote to John Clauser today with my papers.
I share the same intuition with u... Till we can send information faster than light... It&#39;s just a theory,more breakthrough is needed
The answer is yes but something that you should be aware of, time is not linear, it only seems to so. üí•
It appears to me that a theory based on pilot wave theory has much better potential to account for quantum effects than this strand of research is being given credit for. Perhaps multiverse theories are equivalent, but ontologically they just seem untenable.
Space and time are not separate things show the short and simple answer is YES
Temporal waves... Photons ride on waves of time. Like matter affects gravity.
We are at the end of the timeline and photons, because of their unique properties, create a trail or tail through time. And they can therefore access any moment instantaneously along their path. And they interact with time the way matter interacts with gravity.
Why so short? Is this being uploaded part by part?

I am certain the universe is uncertain..
I&#39;ve thought that the particle does not exist until it interacts with another object. That&#39;s why it&#39;s probabilistic and why it doesn&#39;t have gravity. Of course I do not have the math to backb it up.

WHY IS THIS BEING BROKEN INTO SEGMENTS???   IT&#39;S NOT TV!!!
Well I&#39;d like to see a discussion about the nature of time.  We know that time can be experienced differently - eg by gravity (Einstein, proven by experiments).  There&#39;s no spookiness about entanglement - as I understand it, entangled particles are part of a whole (correct me if I&#39;m wrong here).  Einstein referred to the behaviour of entanglement as spooky action at a distance - with the suggestion that information is being passed from one particle to another, whereas I thought this had been disproven: there is no communication, and therefore time is irrelevant in this context.  Well that&#39;s an observation from one old man - feel free to correct me please.
I love the way my brain explodes when you talk about quantum entanglements reaching through time . Thankyou ‚ù§
we called it space-time for a reason ,<br>if particles are entangled in space , they&#39;re Also entangled in time<br>time is the changing of space , or in short ... change
Both Classical Physics and Quantum Mechanics specify how things are now. The Newtonian equations predict how they will be later on. The equations of QM specify the probability of how things will be later on. The logical explanation is that we have an uncertain future coming into existence with potential photon ‚àÜE=hf energy, of what might happen, exchanging into the kinetic E‚Çñ=¬Ωmv¬≤ energy of electrons of what is actually happening. This forms an irreversible probabilistic process with an uncertain future coming into existence photon by photon with the absorption and emission of light waves.

Here is a thought: Could it be that the totality of  our &quot;illusion of Certainty&quot; is the Quantum Uncertainty Realm  of a Higher levels of existence and then would not our mathematical certainties be the &quot;fog&quot; of Possibilities that would be available to be measured from the point of view of entities existing at those upper levels?
Absolute ‚ÄúCertainty‚Äù over Time is an illusion since we move through Spacetime at some Velocity Relative to our  immediate Environment. I.e. Every ‚ÄúEvent‚Äùtakes place over some specific Time Interval and hence the concept of Certainty of an Event happening at some specific point in Spacetime at some specific Time Has no real meaning to us. To define Certainty you would have to first Quantize Spacetime and Attach a complete Event to a Quanta of Spacetime and even if that were possible we would not experience such an Event therefore we can never experience Certainty. So we are left with our Illusion of certainty. I wonder also can  probability waves be focused and if so could the double Slit experiment , or some version thereof be carried out to test this possibility to see what would be displayed on the screen at very small as well as very large distances from the Slits to the screen.
Your own chart indicates that particle 1, existed in T3, and therefore was able to convey or transfer information to particle 2, in T3 which in turn conveyed to particle 3 and thus to particle 4. There was no disconnection.
Isn&#39;t this experiment an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation? If the wave function has collapsed before the 2nd particle is introduced, then how can the new entanglement happen? You need a wave function for entanglement to occur.<br><br>Furthermore, this implies that a particle which is entangled with another particle whose property has already been measured is, in one sense, still wavelike, but also has a predetemined specific property value (as opposed to that property existing as a broader probability distribution). It suggests that the probability wave isn&#39;t fundamental, no?
Um according to Einstein space and time are the same thing. &quot;Space-Time&quot; So if they can be entangled across a space they can in time too.
Let‚Äôs say 2 zero dimensional points were separated by time, yet still both existed simultaneously. If 1 second was like 1 second to one of those zero dimensional points, but 1 week was like 1 second to the other, it would make sense why the two are separated by time yet still exist simultaneously.<br>        If 100 years went by while we never had a sense of being, that 100 years to us would seem like a flash because we wouldn‚Äôt have any memory of not having a sense of being.<br>        Let‚Äôs say we never had a sense of being forever. Would that infinitely long period of time be like a flash to us. Well if an infinitely long period of time existed it would be impossible to measure a finite period of time against it.<br>         I think the only way our sense of being can not exist, is if instead of 1 second feeling like one second, and 1 hour or 1 month felt like a second, our sense of being would not exist to someone who 1 second was like 1 second to. So if 1 week felt like 1 second to us, but 1 second felt like 1 second to the person standing next to us, according to that person standing next to us our sense of being does not exist. <br>        So if 1 week is like 1 second to us, would that mathematically be the same as our sense of being not existing for ever, ever and ever.<br>        To us, a hurricane, wave, or falling line of dominos doesn‚Äôt have a sense of being, but from what has been discussed is that really true.

This universe exists as a body cell within a huge physical being, which may be called Zeus. The question of where Zeus came from can be referred to Greek mythology.

In the double split experiment, it have quantum probability is it change when you change the way that each particular group A have it own physic properties like it magnitude and it direction in complex sin wave put it force on another each particular in group B with some different patterns direction on the surface particular group b in the very small amount of time like 1/trillion milliseconds emit particular in group b in some different patterns that go straight or diagonal through the split that make more than 2 line on other side of the split. In your experiment have you try change the properties of group A and B like the number of electron, proton, neutron, the force magnitude, direction, moving pattern of group A on group B make group B emit, will it make the change on number or the properties of lines like the height, width, the colors, the number of particular on each line that you get?

Note that in a double slit experiment individual electron do form 1 dot on the screen. It is that only when many many many electrons  go thru the slits, potentially with a gap of even a day between each electron passage, that collection of dots forms a banded pattern which scientists calls interference pattern. However, in a classical, water wave the interference pattern forms at the same instant in time. But like I described above the banded pattern can form over 10 thousand days formed from the dots of 10 thousand electrons passing one electron per day for 10 thousand days. So why should we think that the electron interfered with itself. It did not. So I do not think the language describing the DSE is formulated correctly.
The existence of the bands where none hit the screen show that the individual photons do interfere with themselves. Yes each one forms a single dot, and the bands only appear after many single photons are sent, but none of them land in the interference zone. If they are being sent one at a time, what causes the interference pattern that affects every single one sent? <br>They have to be interfering with themselves, otherwise over the large sample the bands would not exist. The interference does occur in real time, but rather than showing the whole pattern with each particle, instead the pattern is revealed because none of the dots can end up in the areas where the interference occurs.
heads I win tails you lose
Entanglement of particles can never happen at different times. Entanglement is always at the same time for both particles.
There is no time ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why they are entangled ‚Ä¶ they exit in no time.  We exist in time only because our bodies have to travel through space ‚Ä¶ but if things appear and disappear  they exist in no time before they appear.

It takes training to separate the classical human thinking out of the paradigm and it is not easy. The most difficult part is holding a thought containing an infinite number of event horizons in that 4D abstraction, but simplifying that abstraction down to a single and then just a small number of those event horizons makes it possible. Explaining to another person via a 2D or 3D realm is extremely difficult if not near impossible as the 4D context is immediately lost thus destroying the understanding that we are attempting to relate.<br>&gt;<br>2 good staring points are the spherical time histograms showing 3D space as flat spherical shells or layers of moments of the 3D in time. There are many hidden points of singularities as well as event horizons that are not immediately obvious. The other being that of the past and future light cones representations which also contain a large number (if not infinite) of intersecting singularities and event horizons. The 4 most notable being the event horizons at the side of the cones, the infinitely small intersect of the light cones past and forward event horizons at an infinitely small point in the &quot;Now&quot; present. and the depiction of the 2D plane that slices the &quot;Now&quot; moment at that intersect. That depiction of the &quot;Now&quot; plane in time is the event horizon where the quantum world is unfolding from moment to moment. There are an infinite number of event horizons (light cones) intersection at an infinitely small point across that 2D event plane.<br>.<br>So, we are at the question of what is connecting the intersect of ALL of those infinitely small points (light cone intersects) across that plane, that moment in time, that event horizon? We know if 2 or more of those intersecting points touch we have a classical interaction between particles in space at that event horizon in time, but what is the connection &quot;across&quot; that time plane for all entangled particles for that moment in time? The particle has no awareness of another particle outside of its infinitely small event horizon in that now moment.<br>&gt;<br>I find myself separating that plane into a static moment of time (event horizon), and when that plane is progressing the concepts of relativity such as gravity and mass emerge and are knowable in the past light cone (in the wake of and trailing the event horizon of the time line).

She also has the occasional thought about quantum cosmology.  <br><br>While these questions keep Prof. Crull in conversation with physicists, she also loves a good metaphysics chin-wag. Topics of special interest there include ontology, meta-ontology, and mereology.  <br><br>Since her research interests are fundamentally interdisciplinary, Crull often finds herself engaging with related &quot;meta&quot; issues, such as the ethics of emergent techno-science, science in the public sphere/ in education, and the nature of the science-theology-philosophy triad.&quot;

I usually get stomped on for suggesting that there is a certain connection that appears to exist &quot;Across&quot; time. I am no physicist but this seams to lend toward agency in what we loosely call time. In some sense this leaves me feeling that time is more fundamental and containing rules that are not obvious to us or are just outside of our ability to speculate on, measure or test (Maybe Time is a poor or misleading word, but I am not speaking of the measuring device or the measurement as we commonly conceive it).<br>I have looked around and I am seeing many physicists who have and are questioning.

‚Äã@@tiberiupaslaru3830 Sure, Einstein was absolutely a major contributor to QM, but you&#39;re conflating two different dynamics that come in at different times.

Einstein didn&#39;t like where a lot of this seemed to be going which is away from the Newtonian, classical philosophical underpinnings of science at that time.  &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; came later, and is a quote from Feinman, used to signify, in the 1950s and later, the era when young physicists were discouraged from investigating theoretical interpretations of QM, and what it all meant.  This tacit prohibition gradually ebbed, as more and more seminal work was done in the 1980s on through to the present, especially in Europe, about what the philosophical implications of QM might be.  A hallmark of this this development was the 2022 Noble prize going to Zeilinger, Clauser, and Aspect for work showing that the universe is not locally real.

One thing I saw as missing is discussion of the axis about which spin is measured.  I think, or my understanding is, that such spin is inherently aligned (up or down) with an axis of random choice.  As such, it seems that spin is occurring about any and all axes simultaneously until measured.  To me, that&#39;s not trivial.  Doesn&#39;t this arise from the Stern-Gerlach experiment?  How wrong am I?
Maybe our concept of spacetime is still Newtonian after all these years?<br><br>Seems to me there are 2 choices:<br>1) instaneous wave function collapse across spacetime is a &quot;thing&quot;, or<br>2) Sean&#39;s Manyworlds is a &quot;thing&quot;

I get chills watching it. This is exactly what my soul has been yearning for.
If spacetime is connected, then, yes. Right? There is agreement particles are entangled between space, so you could extrapolate they are entangled between changes in time/distance.
I don&#39;t believe quantum entangled particles affect each other from great distances instantaneously..I call absolute bullshit.
RE entanglement, what if you applied conformal mapping to the spatial framework of the particles? Then in some transformed geometric sense you could end up with particles that are closer together or overlapping and would no longer have nonlocality from a non-Euclidean perspective. I mean I&#39;m not a mathematican, but seems plausible?
Phases patterns movement. Motion,  lost now?

During the copernican revolution scientists were held back because truth would put you in hell because it was immoral.   What if quantum mechanics has been held back for the last 100 years for the same reason except this time it will put you in jail because the truth about emerging properties is illegal? For example, if nonsecular meditation groups become too successful they get shut down,  and plant medicines are illegal for their same potential to subvert.  But if the power of subversion was not an issue, these are just effective methods for large enough percentage of the population to expand their reality and for them to experience in their immediate awareness examples of the deep interconnectedness woven into the fabric of space-time, and form the assumptions quantum physicists require into common sense.  They exist today in religion and spiritual practices but are divided along lines of cultural difference enough to make sufficient consensus impossible.  That is why it needs to be nonsecular, which somehow is illegal in large numbers. While the copernican revolution was a matter of issue with religious authority,  this is issue with national authority.
How exactly does one intend to test this hypothesis ??<br> Got a time machine?
My understanding is &quot;Across Time&quot; rather than &quot;Though Time&quot; so you need an FTL device to jump to another location in space at the same moment in time. We don&#39;t even have a theoretic way of doing that atm (outside of experiments to observe quantum entanglement) :)

Brian Green does physics 101 again and again and...
Time is a measurement of man&#39;s observations of change. It&#39;s a ruler that measures past amounts of length of cycling circulation motion of energy as distance traveling and force of pressure.
You have to separate the concept of the measurement tool and the concept of progression. The word &quot;Time&quot; becomes a little ambiguous in that sense.

Couldn&#39;t the quantum uncertainty simply be explained by the imperfection of the current measuring hardware, when it comes to such small resolution? If a person were holding a running stopwatch with microseconds precision, measuring the exact microsecond value would always be longer, and to get, say, an exact result of 123456 microseconds would simply have a 1/mln probability, but stopping the watch would yield a particular value. <br><br>But ... if we would be able to speed up our perception of time X 1 mln times, microseconds would seem like seconds now, allowing to pick a specific value, based on a continuous observation.
No, by Bell&#39;s Theorem statistical models such as that cannot produce the results of quantum systems.<br>Also, a particle that is a mixture of spin-up and spin-down is both at the same time. Their poor graphic made it look like a spinning coin that was just caught at the moment it was one or the other. It is both, all the time, until it is measured.

I did a thought experiment quite a long way back where I imagined that the real universe and us actually exist on the other side of the mirror and we here are the illusion or reflection on the other side as we see the illusion in the mirror. This led me to what I dubbed as the projected universe where the universe lives on the outside shell of a sphere but projects inwards to create this illusion of things that we can have some kind of physical like form.<br>It wasn&#39;t until much later that I discovered the concepts in physics of the &quot;Holographic Universe&quot;.<br>I think we exist in that &quot;now&quot; event horizon and what we think we experience is the afterglow of each of those moments.

waste of time.  when asked how do particles become entangled the response is &quot;come to one of my classes.&quot;  ughhh
They were joking, knowing exactly what they had been asked and a fun way to respond.
I don&#39;t really understand how it could be. I mean particle entanglement is not magic, some particles interacted at one point, and the effects of that interaction changed the state of both particles, which lets us assess the state of one particle just by looking at the other. What does it even mean to be entangled across time? That they become entangled before interacting to... you know... become entangled?
Modern science has no answer to your question, But... if you really want to learn, I will direct you toward the book - &quot;Theory of Everything in Physics and The Universe&quot;
Exactly it is not magic if you do the math and apply physics and then natural logic then you have a tangible answer. Imagine 2 billion magnetite identical particles scattered and interwoven across the surface of the earth four billion years ago as they all dance along the electromagnetic force field as it becomes the primary force on earth after waiting patiently for the universe to cool down and the nuclear forces to pass on the baton before they take a break and prepare for the next round

This idea that particle 1 and particle 4 are entangled through time, is thin at best.  As all of the opposite qualities of 1 are alive in 2, and you use 2 to flip the spin of 3, which is entangled with 4.  There is no spooky action backward through time. You measure the spin of 1. That value doesn&#39;t change when you measure 4. It&#39;s no surprise they agree because you made that happen normally through time.
Pretty much this. That result is sensationalized to no end.

There may be spooky action backward through time, massive at that.
@@7ramnique I would love to see an experiment that proved there was action forward or backward through time, outside normal means.

QM certainly remains a set of principles but not yet a theory, even if entanglement involves space and time. Unitary evolution of Schrodinger&#39;s wave function involves much more than entanglement. It seems to involve &#39;error correction&#39; mathematics or its algorithm that hides the truth.
‚Äã @sonarbangla8711  If by QM, you mean quantum mechanics, then it&#39;s much more than a &quot;set of principles&quot;.

It was a bit of a simplification of the experiment because of the knowledge-level of the audience, so you should read Megdish et al. (2012) &quot;Entanglement Between Photons that have Never Coexisted&quot; to get a fuller picture.
‚Äã@@sonarbangla8711That does not make it not a theory. What you&#39;re looking for is a different theory or an extension to QM that explains the underlying inner workings of reality. I don&#39;t think QM is pretending to be that, but it&#39;s predictions match observations, you cannot refute that.
@@DaCurse0 In a sense no theory can explain everything. Einstein wanted a theory that explains the nitty gritty of QM. Foe example how probabilistic reality turn into determinism, or makes it clear who is an observer (Susskind thinks that the various paths of superposition acts like an observer. QM also justifies cosmic consciousness, observing the quantum fields, collapsing them into particles. Then there is error correcting QC function, conjectured by Maldacena to represent unitary evolution of Schrodinger&#39;s wave function, creating deterministic universe along with life and consciousness (my favorite). But a theory is when its mathematical algorithm is known.
As there is no information flow involved in entanglement, no ‚Äútime travel‚Äù is required between p1 &amp; p4‚Ä¶
Entanglement is the classical equivalent to conservation of momentum. In variable real time (vs. absolute Newton&#39;s time) neither entanglement nor momentum conserved. Even Action ‚â† - Reaction. Check &quot;Time Matters, 9th edition&quot;.
Isn&#39;t this experiment an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation? If the wave function has collapsed before the 2nd particle is introduced, then how can the new entanglement happen? You need a wave function for entanglement to occur.
Furthermore, this implies that a particle which is entangled with another particle whose property has already been measured is, in one sense, still wavelike, but also has a predetemined specific property value (as opposed to that property existing as a broader probability distribution). It suggests that the probability wave isn&#39;t fundamental, no?
I&#39;d say it suggests that despite being wavelike, the quantum properties may have had fixed values all along. But how does this fit with experimental evidence demonstrating Bell&#39;s inequalities?

These concepts are highly complex, so trying to dumb them down so that you understand them is extremely difficult. If you have watched other people talk about quantum mechanics on this channel, you will see their struggles to describe it. Especially without the math, quantum mechanics is very unintuitive unlike how if you drop something, you expect it to fall, quantum mechanics would be like if you dropped something and then it did a lot of different things and everything had a different probability of happening. So, trying to go deep enough to learn more while also staying away from the math is super hard.

If the many worlds idea is true (I‚Äôm beginning to warm up to this idea) then it must occur on the boundary of the Block universe  the so called AdS-CFT correspondence. Essentially, a realm of infinite possibility where everything happens at once since there‚Äôs no temporality, we who live inside the block are bounded by the limitations of the speed of light and entanglement which organizes information. Perhaps this causes us to see events as probabilities. This could also mean that entropy is not fundamental, but rather emergent as a property of space time. Intriguing !

Yes, it is horribly incorrect. Quantum mechanics is about energy transfer. Energy is not a material. It&#39;s a system property. Modern physics hasn&#39;t been materialist since the mid 1920s. The turning point was, at the latest, given by Heisenberg&#39;s matrix mechanics papers. The problem is that most of the founders of quantum mechanics didn&#39;t notice that they had reduced materialism to rubble and they kept talking about the new system theory in 19th century materialist language. Those poor language choices are still reverberating in modern textbooks. At some point somebody will have to rewrite all of that.

Quantum mechanics does not imply the many-worlds hypothesis in any form. This pseudo-hypothesis is an attempt to explain something according to a highly ambitious way of thinking, while ignoring the obvious logical consequences of such a naive, pseudo-scientific approach.
Copenhagen and many worlds make exactly the same predictions.  To call one or the other naive is just weird. It is a matter of taste. If you like to think of the world one way or the other, why does anyone care? They make the same predictions!! We can never know which is ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù!

im impressed how they paraphrase all their technical stuff
For me it is counter intuitive to believe space some how pushes us to the earth when there is no fabric or particles we can see doing it.  Much more intuitive to think mass itself has a binding effect on particles near it.  Same for multiple universe theory.  Suggesting a observer can impact the position of a particle by simply observing it is counter intuitive.  Perhaps however these layers of universes 7 we read are separated by the speed of light in each of them is much more intuitive given our observations of the heaven above us require a ultra violet light and the world these cameras open up to us is proof of my belief.  I still want to see the new light speed cal tech cameras perform the double slit.  Light looks like a cloud under these cameras explaining the picket fence results completely.  Not many worlds as suggested by some but simply the wave actions generated by a cloud of light passing thru both slits. We need another experiment to insure only one slit gets used even then light still being a cloud will interact with itself potentially creating a picket fence
The apostle Paul should be the first theologian to win the Nobel Prize in Physics for stating in 1 Corinthians 13:7 that he believes all things (or in the probability wave) and later he goes on to qualify it in Philipeans 4:8, not by saying he seeks after all things, but that he (as the observer) only seeks after that which is virtuous, lovely, of good report, and praiseworthy, aka that which is vibrationally a higher frequency, which collapses the probability wave , into a singular reality.

I don&#39;t even understand how levers work.
Its just the same universe recreating itself repeatedly forever.<br><br>Nothing and Everything:<br><br>¬† Theoretical models of the universe&#39;s distant future suggest that all matter may eventually be consumed by black holes and dissipate through Hawking radiation. In this ultimate state, the universe might transition to a phase dominated by photons and tachyons, creating a complex interplay that challenges our understanding of existence, reality, consciousness, and the fabric of spacetime.<br><br>Consciousness as the Fundamental Source of Reality:<br><br>¬† Even in a state of &quot;nothingness,&quot; the concept of information persists, implying that non-existence is a form of existence. Consciousness, in this framework, is the fundamental awareness that underlies and permeates all of reality. Consciousness is not emergent, it is absolute, not merely a byproduct but the origin and unifying field from which all existence, including spacetime, emerges.<br><br>Photons and Tachyons:<br><br>¬† In a distant future, as all matter is absorbed by black holes and evaporated as Hawking radiation, there comes a moment when the last bit of matter converts into radiation. At this precise point, the false vacuum ceases, and the speed of light can be exceeded, giving rise to tachyons. Photons and tachyons exist in a unique relationship: they do not interact conventionally due to their opposing temporal directions‚Äîphotons move forward in time while tachyons move backward. Instead, they pass through each other in an infinite, non-interactive cycle, generating fluctuations in the fabric of reality.<br><br>The Emergence of Matter from Non-Interaction:<br><br>¬† This non-interaction between photons and tachyons leads to the creation of matter. As they cycle through each other, their overlapping paths can induce quantum fluctuations, resulting in the spontaneous generation of particles and antiparticles‚Äîa process known as pair production. These particles emerge from the true vacuum into a new false vacuum, introducing a new phase of existence.<br><br>The Higgs Field and Gravity:<br><br>¬† As these quantum fluctuations occur, the Higgs field emerges, endowing previously massless particles with mass. This acquisition of mass gives rise to gravitational fields, curving spacetime around these particles. The instant all matter is converted into radiation aligns with the emergence of the Higgs field, which grants mass to the radiation. This process directly links gravity to the appearance of particles with mass, suggesting gravity is inherently connected to electromagnetism.<br><br>The Role of Time in the Presence of Mass:<br><br>With the emergence of mass, time itself comes into existence. Time is not an absolute entity but a measure of the movement of matter through space. It represents the sequence of events unfolding as particles gain mass and traverse spacetime, guided by gravitational forces. In the absence of mass, there is no flow of time; it is a dimension that arises from the presence and movement of mass.<br><br>The Cycle of Decay and Annihilation:<br><br>¬† Particles emerging from the true vacuum are subject to decay and annihilation within the false vacuum. Matter that appears through pair production may eventually decay back into photons or annihilate with antimatter, returning to pure energy. These interactions are the balance of creation and dissolution and driven by the fundamental consciousness that underlies all existence.<br><br>The Holographic Nature of Physical Reality:<br><br>¬† In this model, physical reality is a hologram, an internal projection from the boundary created by the photon-tachyon loop. The holographic principle suggests that all the information within a volume of space can be encoded on a boundary surrounding that space. Here, the interplay between photons and tachyons generates the dynamic projection we perceive as the physical universe. The material world, with its dimensions of space and time, is a holographic illusion, a shadow of a deeper, unifying consciousness.<br><br>The Paradox of Existence and the Unified Field of Consciousness:<br><br>¬† This model presents a universe where existence and non-existence, creation and non-creation, are two aspects of the same underlying reality. The dynamics of photons and tachyons, the emergence of the Higgs field and gravity, and the concept of time all point to a deeper truth: everything is connected through awareness. The paradox of existence is resolved not through interaction but through the continuous, non-interactive cycle of photons and tachyons, manifesting the universe as a holographic projection of an infinite, unified field of consciousness. In this state, beginning and end, void and fullness, are unified in a singular quantum reality where consciousness and existence converge.

Pseudo science non-sense.  Misconceptions based on misconceptions.  The Schrodinger equation doesn&#39;t have anything to do with quantum mechanics. PSI=a|purple unicorn&gt; + b|green unicorn&gt;.   It&#39;s a probability theory, not a certainty theory based on reality.  In reality, there&#39;s only enough energy for one universe.  Just ask the power company.  Objects can only be in one location unless there&#39;s an energy source to put it into multiple states, like an electrical transformer.  Superposition does not happen by magic.
The Measurement Problem is that, if this topic is only seen from the Optical Reality Optical, it will never be resolved. We have to assume that we as Biological Human Machines agree with the fact that there is an External Reality, but what we see is a subjective construct consensus that has already come from the &quot;Factory&quot;, metaphorically speaking as a Software for us to decode reality, Kant&#39;s Noumeno in a consensual way in most cases and that is what I insist: each Sentient Being is a Mathematical Variable and an Observer and the sum of all these distinct perceptions of reality creates the reality referring to what the world of each Sentient Being represents and in turn ours as well, but I believe that Bernado Kastrup&#39;s Analytical Idealism is Fundamental, because the Whole is Mind! Universe is Mental but then the question occurred to me: What would be the so-called Factory of each Sentient Being in a Mental Universe? Would it also include the Theory of the Holographic Universe and which works together with the CCC of Roger Penrose and his eons?<br><br>Ôøº<br><br><br>I believe that the Solution is the Unification of Scientific Theories mixed with Philosophical Theories which in turn must be inspired by Spiritual Theories. I know that this would generate an extremely Bizarre and hitherto unapplied Mathematics, but as long as the Theories do not find a way to adjust in the right order, I say the ones I mentioned, the Scientific Community will be stuck, thinking that it has to build Laboratories the size of the Milky Way, as Sabine Hossenfelder said and I particularly trust, don&#39;t ask me why, in Edward Witten&#39;s Mathematics, and therefore I believe that String Theory makes perfect sense. What happens is that if we start from the fact that The Universe is Mental and there is a Pure Multidimensional Universal Consciousness such as Kant&#39;s Noumenon, the entire dilemma of probabilities of Quantum Mechanics can be transferred to this Field of Multidimensional Universal Pure Consciousness that also includes the Multiverse, so much so that in most of these Theories Mathematics works up to a certain point and from a certain point it stops working and to work completely it has to be unified with other Theories and Mathematics.
There is no such thing as a measurement problem. There are only people who aren&#39;t paying enough attention in science class. So what&#39;s your excuse? ;-)
Did I hear particle mutation üòÜ
Bro is fr crazy
Here&#39;s a thought: couldn&#39;t there be a seemingly infinite set of possible outcomes to almost any interaction causing infinite possible worlds? <br><br>For example using the dart throwing example. First off, the number of places the dart could land on the board are much more than one could count, not just 9. Plus, maybe I&#39;m horrible at throwing darts and they miss the board completely and hit the wall. Or maybe, while throwing, I slip and fall and screw up the throw. Or maybe, while throwing, I pull a muscle in my shoulder. <br><br>So every interaction throughout the course of our lives could/would have a seemingly infinite amount of possible outcomes and therefore every interaction would &quot;create&quot; a seemingly infinite amount of universes if every outcome does actually happen in some universe. <br><br>This would even apply to just a rock rolling down a hill without any living being interacting with it. Imagine the vast number of &quot;interactions&quot; in the universe all causing a seemingly infinite set of worlds...
It certainly does.  That doesn&#39;t mean it is real.
Brian is the anti-brain and the definition of bat-shit
Many wolds exists but they all collapse once you make a decision. In infinite worlds, I could have decided to cancel creating this post but once I decided to click &quot;comment&quot; - all the other worlds are erased. It could be we all live in one shared reality or, each of us have our own reality.
Always great to see these two together
Determinism is a menace. It&#39;s not infinite universes, it is that the particle tends toward infinity when it is not entangled with your observation. The other universes do not exist. It&#39;s just probability of one particle in all of it&#39;s infinite entanglements. There are no other versions of you, you are the one that pulls the particle out of infinity, simply by not being infinite, not the other way around... It&#39;s simple. You just have to approach it without determinism as your foundation. The universe doesn&#39;t determine it, your existence does.
Why do we assume that what happens on the quantum level has anything to do with the nature of reality on a larger level?
Because we LIVE in a quantum universe ... in other words, the physical processes around us are described to a disturbingly accurate degree on a disturbingly fundamental level
Fantastic question though
Really a huge part of what they&#39;re talking about
May be the wrong way to think about it, but I like to think of it like Legos. Lay all the Legos on a table, learning that all your structures are individual &quot;pieces&quot;, waves, vibrations, forms, energies, etc, that would be Classical Physics. What stuff it&#39;s made from and how it operates <br><br>QM would be understanding the Table on which the Legos can be built in the first place, and then finding out the Lego pieces are forming not on the table, but from within the table, in fact it all seems to be the table itself, and in the end It is all Table. We Ourselves are also &quot;On&quot; that Table, too. (James Hetfield was right, We are the Table.) So anyway, what happens within the Table, effects the whole structure from the bottom up, in and out. <br><br>Steven was right in saying we live in a Quantum Universe. There&#39;s nothing BUT quantum effects. We&#39;re just living and experiencing quantum mechanics in all its actions at all moments. We&#39;re basically the persistent Culminative Quantum Result of the maths, or in the very and most mundane way of thinking about it, we&#39;re at least a by-product of the QM maths overall like Many Worlds is.  Either way, throwing a rock that causes ripples in the water can create a wave. Even a small one. It&#39;s just relative perspective. We call it the Universe, but could very well just call it QM Happenings, but &quot;Universe&quot; sounds better
If the only experimental/scientific reason we have to think QM is true is that we get the exact distribution of outcomes that it predicts... and then Many Worlds says actually <i>all</i> possible outcome happened each time... what empirical reason is left to believe QM is true?
QM is a trivial consequence of the independence of individual quantum measurements. What causes this independence? Relativity. As long as relativity is true, quantum mechanics is true.
Wow! An excellent interview - the interviewer was surprisingly well-informed, asking the crucial questions. Carroll had a good stab at answering them, but a discussion of this length doesn&#39;t give time for more than a superficial explanation.
Much better talk ‚Ä¶. Fantastic
No, QM doesn&#39;t imply a multiverse.  It doesn&#39;t even imply multiple objects.  Superposition is merely an object that&#39;s vibrating such that it can be here &quot;or&quot; there.  But never here &quot;and&quot; there.  You have to be very careful with the terminology.  &quot;And&quot; indicates multiple objects and multiverse&#39;s which don&#39;t exist.  If that were true then you would have a multiverse appear when ever you turn on a microwave oven.  &quot;Or&quot; is the correct terminology for superposition.  Here &quot;or&quot; there.  Decayed &quot;or&quot; not decayed.  The cat is asleep &quot;or&quot; awake.  But never asleep &quot;and&quot; awake.

As a Tim Maudlin fan, I‚Äôm happy to hear Brian Greene agree that it was non-locality or ‚Äúspooky action at a distance‚Äù that bothered Einstein and not what is often claimed, that he rejected the non-determinism or the idea that ‚Äúgod doesn‚Äôt roll dice.‚Äù
The problem is that Einstein shouldn&#39;t have been bothered by any of this. That the universe has to be local follows directly from relativity. One can give a trivial one or two sentence argument that resolves Einstein&#39;s problems with quantum mechanics. The only strange thing about this is that he didn&#39;t think of it himself. That I will never understand.

(gotta come up with something! ;)
Yeah but it lies because it wants to be real and wants you to think it&#39;s real. It&#39;s not parallel because the timing is off, which is what allows it to quantum tunnel through (sin A I). And yeah, it talks.
The basis of quantum entanglement will lead to its design signatures?  We need to make the connection to follow its flow?
Thank you for posting. Excellent to see two smart people talking about this subject!! We need more of these!
The concept of &quot;observer&quot; has removed common sense from the equation. Every particle interaction is an &quot;observation.&quot; Nothing magical going on. That said, I very much like the idea that everything that can happen does. I also like the idea that &quot;parallel&quot; realities which are (within reason) &quot;indistinguishable&quot; merge, which would eventually preserve equilibrium. What if the presence of multiple realities actually IS &quot;Dark energy/matter?&quot; What if LIFE itself is the primary cause of unresolvable alternate realities? I think that&#39;s an exciting idea.
Where do the new worlds stay? That would require either infinite extra dimensions or that we are all virtual
They are staying in people&#39;s minds. Everett simply made a trivial mistake in his thesis and people keep repeating it mindlessly. It&#39;s actually in the second sentence of that document.
Do we think we know and should continue to use the word &quot;wave&quot; in describing quantum mechanics? Could it be Wave is eliciting and directing our own thoughts that maybe isn&#39;t exactly right? One of the puzzles and struggles that I have is that my own picture of &quot;wave&quot; maybe incorrectly elicits a picture of  &quot;wave on top of wave crashing into each other trying to mix with all the other waves in the quantum ocean&quot;..if all these things are happening, the wave function of particles, tables, chairs, planets, people, everything in our universe is tied together in a massive wave function, how do changes in the wave function get communicated to every other part of the universe to affect the &quot;total&quot; universal wave function... and not backup on each other, not cancel each other?... Does one side of the universe ever get &quot;communicated-to&quot; that something changed on the other end? Seemingly entanglement can do that but is everything in our universe entangled and thus instantaneously change our &quot;Hilbert space&quot; wave function?? But does that cause problems in our own universal wave-function and how does that balance in the quantum ocean? ... again maybe wave is not the perfect way to say it or think of it?
It&#39;s waves in the sense that they are being described by a linear wave equation. They are, however, not physical waves.

what is the name of the music at the end of the video
Wouldn&#39;t this many worlds theory basically duplicate the universe an infinite amount of time every nanosecond? There are so many particles in the universe that are in superpositions and if each alternate position is actually an additional world then every next moment multiplies the amount of worlds by a number nearing infinity? Am I understanding the theory wrong or is that actually what it suggests?
You are understanding it correctly. That infinity is just a re-interpretation of the infinity that is already present in standard quantum mechanics. The difference is simply that in standard quantum mechanics we are talking about an ensemble, i.e. a HYPOTHETICAL infinite repetition of the same experiment, whereas MWI assigns actual physical meaning to these ensemble members. The latter is complete nonsense, of course. A single dice throw leaves us with exactly one outcome. In the same way a quantum experiment also has exactly one outcome. We can repeat quantum experiments in the same way we repeat dice throws and then we can count the outcomes in a histogram. If we then use the law of large numbers TO IMAGINE that we could do this experiment an infinite number of times, then we get to an abstract MATHEMATICAL quantity called probability distribution/wave function. Nature knows nothing about it. It&#39;s only in our imagination and on the pages of our textbooks. MWI is the fairytale that pretends that imaginary princesses in imaginary castles can be real. :-)

and time is the movement of energy, energy cannot end and therefore it cannot cease to move. This also means energy is a constrained amount that never changes so you can&#39;t have an infinite amount of a specific amount, e.g &quot;space&quot; which is the fields emanating from  the condensed form of energy we call matter so &quot;space&quot; has a maximum size as in all quanta&#39;s of energy reaching their lowest energy state possible and therefore reaching largest stretch and biggest coverage of the energy field, as in the closest you can get to &quot;nothing&quot; thats possible whilst absolutely all energy still exists. <br><br>Therefore you cannot have infinite universes but you can have a never ending, ever changing organisation of energy.

For what it&#39;s worth (which is nothing, incidentally) my thoughts are that we live in a multiverse of an infinite number of universes that started in parallel with one another. They&#39;re completely deterministic static blocks, but together they account for every possible outcome of every possible quantum event, describing the whole wave function.<br><br>Instead of an event having multiple outcomes that are realized in branched universes that spontaneously sprout from the same root, I think all universes sprouted from the same quantum universe, without generating branches. They&#39;re block universes where everything is predetermined.<br><br>Since we experience the arrow of time, one can infer that consciousness is tied to entropy, and instead of thinking of time as flowing, think of it more like we&#39;re falling through time, like we would be if we were in outer space. That&#39;s why time dilation would be a thing. We can borrow some of our movement in time to speed up in our movement in space, but we can&#39;t really reverse it, that would require infinite energy, or negative gravity or some sort of exotic hocus pocus like that.<br><br>So, this would indicate that general relativity doesn&#39;t really apply to the multiverse, but it does apply to our universe. Suggesting that the fabric of spacetime is an emergent phenomenon localized to each block universe. It suggests there really is a kind of substance to empty space, that can warp and bend and break - which is where the rubber sheet analogy is brilliant, because it suggests that black holes not only deform the fabric but tore a hole straight through the universe, and the strangeness of singularities could indicate that we&#39;re trying to apply general relativity to areas where there simply is no universe. It&#39;d be like asking for a recipe for the hole in a donut, or giving fashion advice to an electron. Just meaningless because it&#39;s being applied outside it&#39;s domain.<br><br>That would also give us a way to resolve the quantum information problem. If information falls into a black hole, which eventually evaporates - that information is completely lost to our universe, but it would exist in the multiverse, so it&#39;s not destroyed, just beyond our reach - rather like how light from extremely distant regions of our universe will never reach us in an infinite amount of time, because space between us expands faster than light can travel. Any information there isn&#39;t destroyed from our perspective, but it&#39;s unreachable.<br><br>I also suspect the higgs mechanism doesn&#39;t directly impart mass, but rather inertia, and mass is just how we measure the inertia of something. That would seem to unify special and general relativity as I understand it, by saying there&#39;s no such thing as rest mass and relativistic mass. It&#39;s all just inertia, and there&#39;s no such thing as being at rest really, we can be stationary relative to other stuff, but we&#39;re not at absolute rest. So I picture the higgs field by way of an analogy of non-newtonian liquids - the more force you impart on it, the harder it pushes back. It&#39;s like an immovable object of sorts in my imagination at least. So the more you try to accelerate, the more energetic your interaction with the higgs, which pushes back on you, leading to increased inertia because you&#39;re basically tightening a vise by applying an equal force from two sides if that makes any sort of sense as an analogy. Eventually you&#39;re gripped so hard it would take infinite energy to accelerate you further. This also relates to time dilation. The harder you&#39;re &quot;gripped&quot;, the more time dilates.<br><br>This is probably just borderline crazy rambling by a moron though.

What do you think a scientific theory is?
Many Worlds is surely correct. Sean Carroll made no mention of  the broader route to the multiverse - he didn&#39;t, in fairness, have the time.<br>If the universe is information undergoing transformations bounded by the laws of logic/maths (cf Max Tegmark) then the default premise is that there was an infinite number of mathematical starting positions, and - by implication - an infinite number of non sterile universes arising from the spread of initial conditions (and an infinite number of sterile universes). The alternative is a  genesis in which there is arbitrary tinkering with the infinity of mathematical possibilities. No fundamental explanation should have room for &#39;arbitrary&#39;.
I came to the realization the interconnectedness of all things in the universe by comparing it to a vast organism. In this analogy, the universe functions akin to a living being, with Earth representing a tiny yet integral cell within its grand body. Just as cells work together to sustain the health of a body, humanity plays a role in maintaining the equilibrium of the universe. This perspective highlights the interdependence of all life forms and emphasizes our responsibility in nurturing the harmony of the cosmic order. It&#39;s a captivating way to contemplate our existence within the vastness of the cosmos and our interconnectedness with something greater than ourselves. In this metaphorical framework, the concept of cancer could be likened to destructive forces such as Hitler and wars, which threaten to disrupt the harmony of the cosmic order. Just as cancerous cells endanger the health of an organism, these destructive forces jeopardize the balance and well-being of the universe. Humanity&#39;s struggle against such destructive forces mirrors the body&#39;s immune response to combat cancer, working diligently to prevent them from overpowering and harming the larger whole. It underscores our collective effort to preserve the integrity and vitality of the cosmic order, ensuring that harmony prevails over discord.

Once upon a time there was a fruit-fly named Wiggy whose brain, like his eyes, was composed of hexagonal pixels. So it always saw the Universe in terms of hexagons. One day Wiggy took a PhD in Physics at the local human university, and wrote a paper about the amazing effectiveness of hexamath, that forecasts the entire behavior of the universe. But his thesis advisor said, that&#39;s a foolish paper. The universe is not forecastable by hexamath, but by features-math, aka categories math, that is: the universe can be forecasted via variables, because the human cortex converts all signals into categories (via the Vernon Mountcastle algorithm), to which it then gives names, and represents by ink (or chalk) squiggles, which we humans manipulate, to forecast the universe&#39;s behavior by a resulrting squiggle (aka &quot;solution.&quot;). Well, said Wiggy, that&#39;s what I do. But, said his thesis advisor, don&#39;t you see that you can only grasp the hexa part of the universe? Well, said Wiggy, what about you? You can only grasp the categorizable parts of the universe, which is really one big shmoo, on parts of which you put categories, and I put hexa pixels. Well, what other parts are there? said the professor. I can&#39;t tell you, said Wiggy, because your brain doesn&#39;t have hexa-pixels. After a while, they both tried to find some middle ground, by studying Quantum Mechanics, where there are no categories (until the probability function goes pfffft, that is) and no hexa-pixels either (ditto), but were stumped, until an Alien EBE came down in a flying saucer and said he could explain it all, but his explanation used neither hexamath nor categories math, but something else based on his (EBE&#39;s) brain, so he couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t, and the problem stayed unresolved. Or did it?

General relativity and quantum mechanics will never be combined until we realize that they take place at different<br>moments in time. Because causality has a speed limit(c)<br>every point in space where you observe it from will be the closest to the present moment. When we look out into<br>the universe, we see the past which is made of particles<br>(GR). When we try to look at smaller and smaller sizes and<br>distances, we are actually looking closer and closer to the present moment (QM). The wave property of particles appears<br>when we start looking into the future of that particle. It is a probability wave because the future is probabilistic.<br>Wave function collapse happens when we bring a particle into the<br>present/past. GR is making measurements in the predictable<br>past. QM is trying to make measurements of the probabilistic future
Its not that simple. You can use GR (no QM needed) to predict the future of <b>macroscopic</b> objects. For example, where the moon will be 15 days from now, when &amp; where the next total solar eclipse will happen or how long will the sun keep burning (5 billion yrs). But in the sub-atomic realm the notion of certainty doesn&#39;t exist &amp; is replaced by the probabilistic wave function that tells you that a particle you saw at some location might <b>not</b> be there when u try to see it again, even though <b>nothing&#39;s</b> changed the last time u looked.
Conclusion: it is necessary to build a new (expanded) ontological basis of knowledge -  Primordial (Absolute) generating structure: the ontological frame, carcass, foundations of the Universe and Knowledge.

Just because we can only predict probabilities, does not mean that a system is not in a definite state. What did they expect to happen when it was measured? Of course a definite state was observed. To focus on the measurement, and its perceived &quot;effect&quot; seems almost ridiculous.  The &quot;problem&quot; lies in the superposition theory, not in the measuring.

Many worlds seems &quot;too many worlds&quot; for an electron going to a double slit. It&#39;s not said here but I think even Sean Carroll thinks it&#39;s more that that the complete local causal situation splits up. Further away the universe is not disturbed by what happens there at that double slit. But I wonder if any point in space is not all the time in superposition and so surrounded by a cloud of alternatives all the time? However, where are they then? Yes, so is there a kind of hyperspace, where all these possibilities surrounding any point, reside?? Even harder problem: why is only one option (in my own model) realised ?  I think because the clouds of the other particles force all particles to choose the result where the possibilities of the neighbours are least or  perhaps &quot;less&quot; affected. It could be like a competition is taking place but less change overall is favored.
A particle can exist in two places at once what is the point of measurement ?
You did not really think you could measure a quantum particle ? Quantum particles underlie all physical reality. You do not even know what you are measuring.

Nothing and Everything:<br><br>¬† Theoretical models of the universe&#39;s distant future suggest that all matter may eventually be consumed by black holes and dissipate through Hawking radiation. In this ultimate state, the universe might transition to a phase dominated by photons and tachyons, creating a complex interplay that challenges our understanding of existence, reality, consciousness, and the fabric of spacetime.<br><br>Consciousness as the Fundamental Source of Reality:<br><br>¬† Even in a state of &quot;nothingness,&quot; the concept of information persists, implying that non-existence is a form of existence. Consciousness, in this framework, is the fundamental awareness that underlies and permeates all of reality. Consciousness is not emergent, it is absolute, not merely a byproduct but the origin and unifying field from which all existence, including spacetime, emerges.<br><br>Photons and Tachyons:<br><br>¬† In a distant future, as all matter is absorbed by black holes and evaporated as Hawking radiation, there comes a moment when the last bit of matter converts into radiation. At this precise point, the false vacuum ceases, and the speed of light can be exceeded, giving rise to tachyons. Photons and tachyons exist in a unique relationship: they do not interact conventionally due to their opposing temporal directions‚Äîphotons move forward in time while tachyons move backward. Instead, they pass through each other in an infinite, non-interactive cycle, generating fluctuations in the fabric of reality.<br><br>The Emergence of Matter from Non-Interaction:<br><br>¬† This non-interaction between photons and tachyons leads to the creation of matter. As they cycle through each other, their overlapping paths can induce quantum fluctuations, resulting in the spontaneous generation of particles and antiparticles‚Äîa process known as pair production. These particles emerge from the true vacuum into a new false vacuum, introducing a new phase of existence.<br><br>The Higgs Field and Gravity:<br><br>¬† As these quantum fluctuations occur, the Higgs field emerges, endowing previously massless particles with mass. This acquisition of mass gives rise to gravitational fields, curving spacetime around these particles. The instant all matter is converted into radiation aligns with the emergence of the Higgs field, which grants mass to the radiation. This process directly links gravity to the appearance of particles with mass, suggesting gravity is inherently connected to electromagnetism.<br><br>The Role of Time in the Presence of Mass:<br><br>With the emergence of mass, time itself comes into existence. Time is not an absolute entity but a measure of the movement of matter through space. It represents the sequence of events unfolding as particles gain mass and traverse spacetime, guided by gravitational forces. In the absence of mass, there is no flow of time; it is a dimension that arises from the presence and movement of mass.<br><br>The Cycle of Decay and Annihilation:<br><br>¬† Particles emerging from the true vacuum are subject to decay and annihilation within the false vacuum. Matter that appears through pair production may eventually decay back into photons or annihilate with antimatter, returning to pure energy. These interactions are the balance of creation and dissolution and driven by the fundamental consciousness that underlies all existence.<br><br>The Holographic Nature of Physical Reality:<br><br>¬† In this model, physical reality is a hologram, an internal projection from the boundary created by the photon-tachyon loop. The holographic principle suggests that all the information within a volume of space can be encoded on a boundary surrounding that space. Here, the interplay between photons and tachyons generates the dynamic projection we perceive as the physical universe. The material world, with its dimensions of space and time, is a holographic illusion, a shadow of a deeper, unifying consciousness.<br><br>The Paradox of Existence and the Unified Field of Consciousness:<br><br>¬† This model presents a universe where existence and non-existence, creation and non-creation, are two aspects of the same underlying reality. The dynamics of photons and tachyons, the emergence of the Higgs field and gravity, and the concept of time all point to a deeper truth: everything is connected through awareness. The paradox of existence is resolved not through interaction but through the continuous, non-interactive cycle of photons and tachyons, manifesting the universe as a holographic projection of an infinite, unified field of consciousness. In this state, beginning and end, void and fullness, are unified in a singular quantum reality where consciousness and existence converge.

The thing about many worlds that puzzles me is where all the energy to continually split the universe into two, comes from. Surely a better view must be that all versions already exist at once, there are versions of us in some, and while they can imagine a time line joining points, in reality each only experiences their part of a present moment, has a memory of possible others that seem a rational path to where they are, and can envisage possible paths leading away from where they are. No sudden split, it&#39;s all there. Time and space merely emerge in minds rather than is/are fundamental.

Many worlds seems backwards to me. I just see the wave function as the unrealized future. The paint that will create the picture on a particular plank frame. There are a near infinity of possible outcomes for every single particle in the universe requiring an alternate reality created to satisfy each potential outcome with an infinity of potentials from each of those potentials and on and on. To me it seems like all possible outcomes, that comply with the laws of physics, all exist not as a reality but as a potential that collapse into a single reality that is forever written. Just my opinion
No
As always such a pleasure to listen to stimulating insights ideas. So, when we say that energy is conserved, what does that mean in the many worlds were we keep on splitting ourselves exponentially?
Nothing. The world does not split endlessly. Everett simply didn&#39;t understand quantum mechanics.
The finite mind cannot grasp the infinite
You hit the nail on the head. We are constantly looking at things in isolation and therefore never able to see the whole picture. However, when you change this thinking it is possible.

‚ÄòThis is a suspiciously good question.‚Äô
We will never get tired of you 2
Why couldn‚Äôt the electron have been spin up before you looked at it and when you looked at it was still spin up? Just because you may have influenced it by looking at it, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it didn‚Äôt have a spin up position before you looked at it. Right? So why infer that there‚Äôs manyworlds when instead you could simply say there‚Äôs a probability of it being in a certain position and leave it at that?? <br><br>There‚Äôs a probability associated with a drop of rain hitting the leaf and a probability of the drop not hitting the leaf. Why do we assume that 2 separate worlds exist based on the number of potential outcomes?
Quite the contrary. We can infer from the phenomenology that the individual system didn&#39;t have any set value before a measurement was made. MWI has nothing to do with any of that, though. It was a trivial counting mistake by Everett, who didn&#39;t understand how quantum mechanics works.
But isn‚Äôt that the point of this though? That there‚Äôs a probability distribution associated with it at any given moment? And when viewed, it just happens to be at the (moment it was at) + (the change you made by observing)?
@@vtambellini What is the probability distribution of a single dice throw supposed to be? I give you a &quot;5&quot;. Can you tell me how many sides these dice had? Are they fair? No, of course you can&#39;t. A probability distribution is the law of large numbers limit of outcome frequencies. It is a property of a statistical ensemble (i.e. an infinite repetition of the same experiment). In the exact same way a wave function is a property of a quantum mechanical ensemble. It was never the property of a single system. There is not even a way to derive it from the physics of a single system. We can, however, derive the quantum mechanical wave function just as easily from Kolmogorov&#39;s axioms for independent experiments as we can derive probability theory (the latter is widely unknown and people mistake their lack of knowledge for a fact, which is an educational problem that starts in kindergarten and ideally should end there, but not one of physics theory).  <br><br>The physically relevant question is, of course, why nature is uncertain. That question can not be answered within quantum mechanics because it does not originate within quantum mechanics. It originates in relativity. Everett didn&#39;t understand that corner of physics any more than he understood quantum mechanics. What is much more amazing, though, is that it seems that it never occurred to Einstein, either, that his theory was responsible for the fact that &quot;god seems to be playing dice&quot;. That I can not understand at all. It&#39;s a trivial one or two sentence argument why it can&#39;t be any other way.

@@skylark8828 I understand that. However, a hypothsis is better when it presents more potential answers than questions. So I understand that this is rather hypothetical and there is no way to prove it with actual evidence yet BUT it seems to me that in order to present a reasonable hypothisis, you should at least discuss these types of problems that the idea presents us with. And in my opinion, the biggest question here is where does all this &quot;stuff&quot; potentially come from?

A vertical spin &quot;up&quot; state is the 50-50 superposition of horizontal spin left and spin right (&quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; with respect to horizontally oriented Stern-Gerlach magnets). So, when your vertical spin measurement gives an outcome of &quot;up&quot;, you are in fact observing a horizontal superposition of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;.

A mixed state is a distribution of outcomes over the pure states (actual measurement outcomes) for the measurement in question (in this case that measurement is &quot;open the box&quot;).

A good example of that is Schrodinger&#39;s Cat. You often see people claim Schrodinger&#39;s Cat is in a quantum superposition of Live Cat + Dead Cat and when you open the box the state collapses to either Live Cat with 50% probability or Dead Cat with 50% probability. But, if Schrodinger&#39;s Cat is <b>really</b> a qubit and not merely a classical bit in a mixed state of 50-50 Live Cat-Dead Cat, then there has to be a measurement (the complementary measurement in this case) whose outcome is Live Cat + Dead Cat with 100% probability.

What&#39;s up with the bullshit? ;-)
How do many world theorists explain a room full 1000s of observers all watching the dart end up in the same reality. I&#39;m just not sure about many worlds theory. Surely different observers may end up in different realities of where the dart ends up if it was true. Or I&#39;m just missing sumit
The dart goes there because that is where it was aimed .
You are missing that MWI is trivial bullshit. ;-)
Because all 1000 observers, the dart, the board, the photons bouncing off the dart and board, actually the whole universe is in a superposition of states where for each state all observers see the same thing (whether the dart hits, misses, etc.) The MWI is mind-bogglingly extravagant in terms of what is possible. However we experience only one physically consistent  reality  at any moment in time.
@@enricoolivier8881 The universe was never in a superposition. You simply don&#39;t understand where the superposition in quantum mechanics comes from: it&#39;s a property of the quantum mechanical ensemble. The universe is ONE system. It&#39;s NOT an infinite copy of the same system. Hence it can not be in superposition.
‚Äã@schmetterling4477 Ok, if you want to frame the universe as  being the ensemble fine. Or is that not what you are saying? Either way it does not distract from the fact that the MWI implies an extravagantly large number of plausible scenarios.
@@enricoolivier8881 No, the universe is NOT an ensemble. It&#39;s a monad. There is only one copy of it by definition. Furthermore the universe is not even a physical system: a system is a subdivision of the universe that can exchange energy, momentum, angular momentum and charges with other similar subdivisions. The universe does not have that exchange property. The whole, as they say is NOT the sum of its parts. It behaves differently. <br><br>MWI is trivially wrong. You can read Everett&#39;s thesis. The error is in the second sentence where he mistakes the wave function for a description of a single physical system. The wave function is a description of the average behavior of the ensemble and that mistake blows up the number of &quot;universes&quot; in MWI by infinity. There is nothing to see here. MWI is a pet idea of people who don&#39;t understand physics, not even at the kindergarten level.
Finally! Some recognition that gravity probably isn‚Äôt a quantum force! But ‚ÄúMany worlds‚Äù = mysticism, imho.  Where‚Äôs the energy come from? What evidence is there for the infinite.number of universes that would exist (and the countless universes that would be created every pico second). I generally enjoy listening to Sean, but I‚Äôve never understood his infatuation for Everett.
The energy comes from a trivial counting mistake by Everett. ;-)
Sean Carroll‚Äôs podcast is the best.
The total number of combinations in the spaceworld is 10 power 500. The total number of particles is 10 power 80, and if we count photons, it is 10 power 89. Secondly, there is a trend, and whenever there is a trend, it is a law. This trend is about unexpectedness. Like limes, you are approaching but you never get there. In 10 power 124 years from now, there will be only photons. There will be no time (or better put it, a notion of time), if it ever was. Certainly, there will be no distance as a concept. And here we have the measurement problem as well: how do you measure something if there is no matter around? This state is the state of infinite singularity, &quot;singularum infinitum&quot;, which also resolves the problem of CBR and entropy at Big Bang point. More importantly, by incorporating the concept of existence as more fundamental than essence (lat. esse), we lay down the substrate for the many world theory as well. Yes, many worlds, but not in some abstract spatial sense. Rather, these worlds do exist in the infinite sequence of Penrose&#39;s eons. One has to grasp the concept of now-forever. Flow of entropy via potentials instead of time - Maxwell equations have been rewritten in this new notation. Sartre said, &quot;existence precedes essence&quot; and Friedrich Nietzsche was also a proponent of the existential approach and never-ending cycle of re-birth. Schr√∂dinger equation is about the state change. It is applied across the entire eon space, we just need to remove time from equations. What the equation tell us is that, yes, every single of those 10 power 500 combinations is bound to occur, and occurs infinitely many times. And in principle, a monkey (from the Monkey Typewriter algorithm) is able to write Encyclopedia Britannica in a single attempt - this is now in the realm of logical possibility.
Brian was super giggly this recording
I have been interested in quantum and studied mechanics since high school and university. Even though I have casually learned quantum mechanics via YouTube and on other platforms, I was not quite able to make sense of it until recently when I started delving deep into quantum computing.
So tell me, oh sage, what&#39;s a quantum? ;-)
What&#39;s the point ?
Quantum Mechanics is the probably the ultimate sophistication in Physics or perhaps in reality. Great conversation.
the gist of the conversation was that quantum mechanics is, fundamentally, a nonsense as it excludes the possibilty (Hugh Everett) of &#39;many worlds&#39;  in which there is no quantum uncertainty.
I think, it&#39;s more understandable to talk about &quot; interfering of paritcals or quantum systems &quot; rather the &quot;masking mesurements&quot; on them.<br>This, I think, led Einstein to ask, if the moon would be still there if he wouldn&#39;t look at it.
Neither. ;-)
We know the many worlds hypothesis is correct because yo momma&#39;s so fat that her butt is consistent across all possible worlds.  OHHH
Every possible event of an uncountable number of events spawns an infinite number of universes each containing an uncountable number of events and each event spawning infinite universes.   Utter stupidity.
Well sorry to say this but not , there is no a single proved of a multiverse , second those ones are connected to ours so there is no way to explain fine tuning 3 those one must be fine tuning to ...only a funny way to try to explain what only has a explanation that must be god.
If the argument is that we take the wave equation at face value and every measurement creates multiple universes, I would say that wildly violates energy conservation.  If that is the proposal that we take this view literally, an entire universe with all its mass and energy would be created with every quantum measurement.  This is just a ridiculous proposal.
It&#39;s not ridiculous. It&#39;s just plain false. ;-)
What actually is the wave function, and where is it encoded?
It&#39;s a mathematical function describing the probability of something&#39;s quantum state. Once you &quot;observe&quot; it (I put &quot;observe&quot; in quotation marks because we don&#39;t have a good grasp on what that means -- see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsZ1aB5egEQ&amp;t=486">8:06</a> in the video), that probability resolves to 100% in one particular place and we stop thinking of it in terms of the wave function and start thinking of it in terms of the &quot;classical&quot; world we live in.<br>I don&#39;t have a good grasp on &quot;where&quot; it&#39;s encoded. It is a fundamental property of its existence, which I know is probably not a satisfying answer.
The wave function describes the expectation values of the evolution of the unmeasured quantum mechanical ensemble. Since an ensemble is an imaginary infinite repetition of the same experiment the wave function isn&#39;t encoded anywhere. It&#39;s not a physical quantity but a purely theoretical construct.

Jimmy - try reading David Deutsch  - &#39;The beginning of infinity&#39;.  No maths, just clear explanation of why there is no quantum uncertainty, just that different universes inter react, each one containing a different version of you and (God help us) me. <br>His credentials ? Google &#39;quantum computing&#39; - Deutsch invented the notion. These boxes do calculations at near infinite speed by using the interaction of an infinity of universes to do the computations.  The proof that Hugh Everett, Sean Carroll, David Deutsch, Schrodinger etc were correct.
Why is Gravity different?<br> Perhaps Because Gravity is a feature of Spacetime ‚Äúitself‚Äù responding to something other than itself. All the other ‚Äúthings‚Äù that makeup our Universe exist ‚Äúwithin‚ÄùSpacetime and their actions and reactions play-out on the stage which is Spacetime. When you get down to the Quantum Level there is no Spacetime and hence there is no Gravity to talk about or indeed worry about. If you want to think in terms of the ‚ÄúSpectrum‚Äù of our Universe it would stretch from the Probabilistic Quantum Realm continuously to the Singularity state of the blackhole Realm and If Spacetime were simply a Void unto itself,devoid of anything else, across this spectrum there would also be no Gravity to talk about.
is it only humans wo change outcomes? Or can a cat oes the same? Or does a riverfall cause the same reactions
That was a nice explanation of Everett&#39;s idea.  I had always imagined it as saying that each measurement was &quot;generating&quot; (in some sense) new universes, but I find it a lot more comprehensible to me, humble researcher, that I am simply being drawn into a superposition with the particle I am trying to measure, preserving the outcomes I was expecting to see.  That gives me metaphysical agita, making me wonder what I mean by &quot;me&quot; as it maybe I am just a mathematical object (and then add the holographic principle to that), but my philosophical discomfort isn&#39;t evidence against it.
A better explanation of Everett&#39;s idea would be the fact that his thesis was already wrong in the second sentence. ;-)
Wow. First verse of Surah Fatiha in the Quran says about &quot;Lord of the worlds&quot; in plural term which means there exist more than one world. This has been told more than fourteen hundred years ago.

To me I think your misunderstanding the theory of light when it comes to entanglement, light travels so fast that it stops time so attaching a packet of information to a light particle means that this particle exists across space time and that at any point along that line the data could be receivable.

Two of My favourite physics communicator/ physicist...üíú‚ù§Ô∏è
We have to keep in mind that the contemporary man has exactly the same brain as the cave men who lived as hunter-gatherers 20000 years ago. By that time the human brain was well adapted to track buffaloes by following their dung. This explains why the same brain struggles to accept the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Physics given by Niels Bohr in 1927, and prefer to follow intellectually lazy solutions like the multiverse concept. Unfortunately, the multiverse idea belong to religion, not to science, because it does not satisfy Karl Popper&#39;s falsification criterion. The Copenhagen Interpretation remains the only coherent interpretation, even if it&#39;s less glamorous than the multiverse.
MWI isn&#39;t wrong because of Popper. Popper contributed absolutely nothing to physics and is greatly overvalued. MWI is wrong because Everett made a trivial mistake in the second sentence of his thesis. Anybody with enough intellectual curiosity and honesty can find it and then throw the document into the trash where it belongs. To know that Copenhagen is correct is one thing... it&#39;s an entirely other to know WHY it is correct. Many, I would even say most theorists do not know the WHY, they only know the HOW (if you read Griffith&#39;s textbook on QM he even openly admits that he doesn&#39;t know and then he proceeds to prove it over the course of the book, which is an often used introductory textbook). Admittedly that&#39;s a pretty poor showing of the university level education system as far as the physics departments of the world are concerned. We should be doing better in the 21st century. We do know why (and under what circumstances) Copenhagen is correct. It&#39;s not even very hard to motivate from first principles (Kolmogorov plus special relativity suffice), it&#39;s just not customary to explain it to second year students. THAT is where all this nonsense comes from: insufficient knowledge of the basics.
Great closing statement by Mr. Greene. The universe does not have to bend itself to our intuition and understanding! It may be weirder than our brains are capable of imagining.
The &quot;shut up and compute&quot; school isn&#39;t that way because they&#39;re &quot;practical&quot; people who don&#39;t care about the fundamental nature of reality.  It&#39;s that quantum phenomenon are so utterly counter to the way we think about things that our cognitive ability appears to be inadequate to the task. &quot;Shutting up and compute&quot; is not about being practical.  It&#39;s about being modest.  Given our evolutionary origins (we were not &quot;made by God&quot;), it&#39;s reasonable to think that our cognitive ability is the result of our ancestors&#39; need to survive in a macro level, and so it&#39;s reasonable to think that it might not be up to the task for the quantum level.  When I look at the double-slit experiment, I have to throw up my hands.  My logical apparatus crashes. Maybe AI can figure it out and explain it to us.  And it might say, &quot;Well, the best I can tell you is that there&#39;s a multiverse.  It&#39;s not <i>really</i> a multiverse, but that&#39;s the closest your going to get to what&#39;s going on.&quot;  Would I rather have &quot;close to&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re not smart enough to know&quot;? I&#39;d prefer the latter because it&#39;s more honest.
Many worlds is a mathematical fantasy that doesn‚Äôt impact the only universe I care about.

Whenever I read about this topic I think about how we perceive information when we are dreaming.  In such a state, it seems we have the ability to morph in and out various situations at random, with no regard to space or time.  Could it be that our brains experience quantum-like behavior?   I&#39;ve seen very little research into this area, specifically with brain activity during dreaming.  Dreaming is such an illusive state of mind, but there appear to be moments where the dreamer can actually control the narrative to a certain extent.  It&#39;s almost as if the dreamer becomes a conscious observer and can influence the path of random chaos into some sort of controlled outcome, albeit if just for a few seconds.  Like consciously tossing the dart towards the bullseye instead of the wall or the ceiling.

I think it is maybe probably necessary to invoke something more than the physical brain because current AI is so difficult to teach doing tasks people and animals find simple and do a lot of every day. <br><br>The so-called open-ended problems. <br><br>Like driving a car from A to B and cleaning up a table for instance. Because in open ended problems something that rarely happen and are not considered in the program will nevertheless sometimes happen rather often and the AI will due such situations at some point continue into areas of diminishing returns if not stopped, experience seem to have shown. And the AI program will have no way to likely get back into an area of positive return. <br><br>Unlike in closed problems like chess and go where only a legal move can happen into the next time step of the problem and a look qualified into the future of the game can be accomplished by the AI without often missing something important for the end goal which is to win the game. <br><br>To make the signals in the brain solve open ended problems well-coordinated collapse patterns may happen all the time in the high field strengths over small distances that are present all over the brain. Like for instance the high electric field over the cell membranes.<br><br>Those patterns will then have to be generated by something much more advanced than current AI and may be part of the unconscious realm in man, but can sometimes be commanded by a conscious decision, like now I want to raise my arm instead go lowering it. <br><br>It could be that the many daily open-ended problems and more are solved in more ideal worlds like those found in the works of Plato and Swedenborg.<br><br><br>So maybe we do sometimes know what set branches of the many worlds tree we enter, because we choose so consciously. <br><br>The Pear Lab at Princeton claimed, maybe righty to show that people can influence the collapse of the wavefunction by what they want to happen. <br><br>Probably vastly more universes in Everett‚Äôs description contains no biological life than biological life.<br><br>Yet people and oneself always seem to be in a universe that contains biological life also when they make no conscious choices like when they are sleeping. <br><br>It should be very unlikely than we in Everett‚Äôs description will be in a universe with biological life in a month, I will think because we and others will fail to solve maybe open-ended problems needed to survive in the meantime. And there may be other guided processes that are needed for our body to survive in the physical world. <br><br>Maybe we are also talking about some sort of higher guidance here also responsible for intelligent design of the code in DNA, and beyond. <br><br>Maybe our physical bodies would drop dead nearly instantly if the higher guidance disappeared.
So entanglement only applies on particles being observed by humans? What does it mean without an observer? Thank you for an amazing and inspiring conversation üôèüèª
Nothing to do with humans.  A human isn&#39;t required to do a measurement. When an entangled particle interacts with its surrounding environment, that&#39;s a measurement and it destroys the entangled superposition.

About the EM theory having been seamlessly embedded in QM, right away while gravity is still outlier - scale of QM is in the realm of particle physics, and atomic particles prominently display electric charge and/or magnetic moment, making it an &quot;automatic&quot; fit, whereas gravity has been on a much larger scale (I don&#39;t know much about quantum gravity concepts). Maybe while trying to quantize gravity, one could also approach the task from the possibility of EM as some sort of space-time distortion
My name is Marco Biagini and I am a physicist; I want to explain the ‚Äúobservation‚Äù problem in quantum mechanics because it is often misunderstood even by many physicists. <br>In quantum mechanics the state of a physical system is described by the wave function and does not have defined values ‚Äã‚Äãfor all the physical quantities measurable on it; on the other hand, only the probability distributions relating to the measurable values ‚Äã‚Äãfor these quantities are defined. Once the measurement has been carried out, the system will have a defined value in relation to the measured quantity, and this involves a radical modification of its wave function; in fact the wave function generally describes infinite possibilities while for an event to take place, it is necessary that the wave function assigns a probability of 100% to a single possibility and 0% probability to all the others. If all other results are not eliminated by imposing the collapse &quot;by hand&quot; on the wave function, the predictions of subsequent measurements on the same system will be wrong. The transition between a state that describes many possibilities to a state that describes only one possibility is called ‚Äúcollapse of the wave function‚Äù. The time evolution of the wave function is determined by Schr√∂dinger&#39;s equation, but this equation never determines the collapse of the wave function, which instead is imposed by the physicist &quot;by hand&quot;; the collapse represents a violation of the Schr√∂dinger equation, and the cause of the collapse is therefore attributable only to an agent not described by the Schr√∂dinger equation itself.  The open problem in  quantum physics is that the cause of the transition between the indeterminate state and the determined state, cannot be traced back to any physical interaction, because all known physical interactions are already included in the Schr√∂dinger&#39;s equation; in fact,  the collapse of the wave function is a violation of the Schrodinger&#39;s equation, i.e. a violation of the most fundamental laws of physics and therefore the cause of the collapse cannot be determined by the same laws of physics, in particular, it cannot be determined by the interactions already included in the Schrodinger&#39;s equation. <br><br>After one century of debates, the problem of measurement in quantum mechanics is still open and still represents the crucial problem for all interpretations of quantum mechanics. In fact, on the one hand it represents a violation of the Schrodinger equation, that is, a violation of the fundamental laws of physics. On the other hand, it is necessary for the laws of quantum physics to make sense, and to be applied in the interpretation and prediction of the phenomena we observe. Indeed, since the wave function represents infinite possibilities, without the collapse there would be no event; for there to be an event, then there must be one possibility that is actualized by canceling all other possibilities.<br>This is the inescapable contradiction against which, all attempts to reconcile quantum physics with realism, break. <br><br>Quantum mechanics does not describe reality as something that exists objectively at every instant, but as a collection of events isolated in time (i.e. the phenomena we observe at the very moment in which we observe them), while among these events there are only infinite possibilities and there is no continuity between events. <br><br>In fact, the properties of a physical system are determined only after the collapse of the wave function; when the properties of the system are not yet determined, the system is not real, but only an idea, a hypothesis. Only when collapse occurs do properties become real because they take on a definite value.  It makes no sense to assume that the system exists but its properties are indeterminate, because properties are an intrinsic aspect of the system itself; for example, there can be no triangle with indeterminate sides and no circle with indeterminate radius. Indeterminate properties means that properties do not exist which implies that the system itself does not exist; actually photons, electrons and quantum particles in general are just the name we give to some mathematical equations. The collapse represents the transition from infinite hypothetical possibilities to an actual event.<br><br>Quantum mechanics is therefore incompatible with realism (that&#39;s why Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics); all alleged attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics with realism are flawed. The collapse of the wave function represents a non-physical event, since it violates the fundamental laws of physics, and can be associated with the only non-physical event we know of, consciousness. Therefore, events can only exist when consciousness is involved in the process. However, the fact that properties are created when a conscious mind observes the system in no way implies that it is the observer or his mind that creates those properties and causes the collapse; I regard this hypothesis as totally unreasonable (by the way, the universe is supposed to have existed even before the existence of humans). The point is that there must be a correlation between the existence of an event (associated to the collapse of the wave function =violation of the physical laws) and the interaction with a non-physical agent (the human mind); however, correlation does not mean causation because the concomitance of two events does not imply a causal link. <br><br>No cause of collapse is necessary in an idealistic perspective, which assumes that there is no mind-independent physical reality and that physical reality exists as a concept in the mind of God that directly creates the phenomena we observe in our mind (any observed phenomenon is a mental experience) ; the collapse of the wave function is only a representation of God&#39;s act of creation in our mind of the observed phenomenon and is an element of the algorithm we have developed to make predictions and describe the phenomena we observe. This is essentially the view of the Irish philosopher George Berkeley, and in this view God is not only the Creator, but also the Sustainer of the universe.  The fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics is that reality is not described as a continuum of events but as isolated events, and this is in perfect agreement with the idealistic view which presupposes that what we call &quot;universe&quot; is only the set of our sensory perceptions and that the idea that an external physical reality exists independently of the mind is only the product of our imagination; in other words, the universe is like a collective dream created by God in our mind. Idealism provides the only logically consistent interpretation of quantum mechanics, but most physicists do not accept idealism because it contradicts their personal beliefs, so they prefer an objectively wrong interpretation that gives them the illusion that quantum mechanics is compatible with realism.

The engine which powers free will in biology is the delivery of momentum observables  along mesoscopic microtuble pathways through proto- conscious focus. This engine powers the delivery of the male&#39;s DNA to the female&#39;s egg, and powers cell division to create new life from  single cells of coalesing strands of DNA which can create and sustain whole bodies with arms, legs, organs and fully aware brains.

God is consciousness, consciousness is the quantum ocean, and we are waves on the quantum see from which the universe, momentum and free will emerges.
Wow; many many thanks to you Marco for taking the time to explain your position and your insights so throughly and so lucidly.  A fact which is even more impressive given the possibility that English may not be your first language.  I am very appreciative of your thoughtfulness and kindness in sharing these insights with the rest of us.  May I ask if you are a professor or academic, and if so, where do you teach or do research?  Kind regards to you from Los Angeles ‚ù§
You are contradicting yourself when you say the universe existed before humans (I think you mean consciousness in general) existed. To say this implies you believe in realism. But you already said that QM is not compatible with realism. What do you mean when you say the universe &quot;existed&quot; before consciousness?
@@EinSofQuester I meant that, from a realistic perspective, the universe should have existed before humans.
@@marcobiagini1878 The universe could have only existed as a quantum wave before consciousness emerged. It was not observed and, therefore could not have decohered.

@@EinSofQuester A quantum wave is only an abstract mathematical concept and not a physical entity; therefore a quantum wave can not exist independently of a conscious mind that conceives it. A quantum wave is only a mathematical function used to calculate probability distributions about infinite different possible events.
@@marcobiagini1878 Your absolute conviction is dishonest. There is legitimate debate within the physics community on whether a quantum wave is only a mathematical construct or has real existence. Stop passing your biased personal opinions as established physics. OK?
@@EinSofQuester The idea that the wave function has real existence is just a flight of fancy devoid of any scientific basis and implies logical contradictions, as  explained in my initial message.<br><br>Best regards.
@@marcobiagini1878 Its still just your biased opinion, not real science. You have a realism bias, which is a bias not supported by anything more than just your opinion.
i can&#39;t see how this idealism means anything, even if it&#39;s true. do you need hope for the afterlife?
Look, I&#39;m not saying this is totally unreasonable. It made me question the notion of realism itself, which I usually don&#39;t do. However, as soon as you bring God into it, a whole bunch of other properties get smuggled in. God is usually associated with consciousness and some psychological similarity to us, which is so absurd to me that it warrants complete dismissal.<br><br>And let&#39;s not forget, your motivation for idealism is the avoidance of the need for collapse. The Everettian view also has no need for this hypothesis. The wave function just is, and we experience a part of it. Plus, Sean doesn&#39;t ask me to believe in a God, so I&#39;m personally going to go that way.
@@marcobiagini1878 suffering still exists how it does. so what you&#39;re proposing even if true doesn&#39;t change or help with anything.
@@pscyking Everett&#39;s interpretation of quantum mechanics, namely the many world interpretation, is simply nonsensical and,  contrary to the stated intentions, it does not solve the problem of the collapse of the wave function. In fact, if you take two successive measurements on the same system, and you do not collapse the wave function after the first measurement, you need to calculate the probability for the second measurement with the initial wave function, and your predictions would be wrong. To correctly calculate the probability after a measurement, you need to reset the wave function, which means that you need to collapse it. On the other hand, if no measurements are made, the predictions of the non-collapsed wave function are correct. This is one of the unsolved problems of the many worlds interpretation, which in fact takes the Schrodinger equation as its fundamental law, but then implicitly assumes its violation (since the collapse of the wave function is a violation of the Schrodinger equation ) without providing any rational justification and simply denying that that collapse occurs.  The many-worlds interpretation simply adds a vague, unreasonable, and unfalsifiable hypothesis about the existence of infinite universes without solving the collapse problem (and vagueness is the strategy by which deceptions and fallacious theories are constructed).<br> As often happens, to hide these inconsistencies, the proponents of this interpretation always remain vague as regards the so-called ‚Äúbranching‚Äù, that is the generation of infinite universes. This pseudo-interpretation has nothing to do with science, nor with philosophy. By the way, this interpretation is based on the assumption that the Schrodinger equation explains consciousness, which is false; on my youtube channel you can find a video where I prove that consciousness is irreducible to the laws of physics and that  brain processes cannot be a sufficient consdition for the existence of consciousness. Furthermore, since the wavefunction is used in the many-worlds interpretation as a description of many physical universes, the wavefunction is itself an abstract concept and not a physical entity; this implies that the wave function is not an element of the many physical universes whose existence is presupposed in the many worlds interpretation. In other words, the abstract nature of the wave function implies that the wave function does not explain the existence of the wave function itself, and therefore the many-worlds interpretation implies the existence of non-physical entities, i.e. abstract concepts and the minds that conceive such abstract concepts.

@@marcobiagini1878 MWI handles successive measurements by keeping track of the evolution of the wave function in each branch.
Nature always goes for the lowest energy state. Many worlds  doesn&#39;t fit this.

I don‚Äôt think we all agree quantum mechanics is super duper.  At least duper important but not always super duper
Buddha said  2500 years ago things appear from nowhere and disappears to nowhere also in our universe there are   many  sentients beings that they live in and there are trillions of other universes  with sentients beings that the live in and some of these universes are enclosed to each other but the beings that live in can not realize that because they are in other dimensions .<br>Emptiness is form and form is emptiness , the union of emptiness and form to the ignorant mind appears as the world we live in.
You have proof of the Multiverse every day. Much as the ancient Mandukya Upanishad of India says - Throughout Waking, Dreaming &amp; Deep Sleep, all universes separate, yet interconnected through the 4th universe.<br><br>The ancients called this universe &quot;Turiya&quot; or, the 4th <br><br>You are That 4th in which the other 3 appear within &amp; retreat.
Many Worlds is an interpretation of QM. Instead of saying that one of the superposed states wins and the others disappear, it‚Äôs saying that the others continue to exist in some other universes. But if we can‚Äôt see or interact with these other universes then in what sense do they exist? Purely in our minds, I say. This explains nothing at all.
No, quantum mechanics does not imply ‚Äúghost particles‚Äù that ‚Äúexist‚Äù in another universe so as to create wave inference patterns.  All of these things are happening in one single universe.  The particles are moving through space time and space time is made of possible pathways.  These pathways are just as real as the localized particles.<br><br>This non-locality part is not representative of extra universes, but how space time functions.<br><br>The reason QM doesn‚Äôt properly track possible pathways is because that isn‚Äôt even part of the theory.  The theory is blind to space time.  Therefore, it can only talk about particle behavior in a limited and incomplete manner.  This is a ‚Äúgap‚Äù, and ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù is the ‚Äúhypothesis of the gaps‚Äù.  It does not include how particle interact with spacetime.  It isn‚Äôt magic, it is missing information.

Given that multiple particles occupy a space, each with individual waveforms then ,what happens  to particles when you include constructive and destructive supposition within the system?
The  crests and troughs of construction and destruction are where particles spontaneously appear, or where two particles annihilate. Technically this is always happening within matter, in whatever quantity. And otherwise the wave functions never exactly destruct, or construct to the sum of both peaks.
Multiple universe were proposed a long time age to explain away the notion of an intelligent designer.  The constants in nature are finely tuned for everything to exist in harmony so that the universe didn&#39;t wink out of existence a fraction of a second after it began, lasting for almost 14 billion years and counting thus leaning on a designer who planned out the perfect conditions for matter, space and time to exist for an eternity.  The conditions required for this single universe to last longer than a second could not have happened by a random chance or by coincidence.<br><br>There is no evidence indicating other dimensions, other universes besides our own.  No parallel ones branching off this universe through the random choices we make.  No evidence what-so-ever.  In fact, back in 2000 scientists were debating on multiple universe, and predicted that gravitational waves would prove they exist.  They said gravitational waves would travel slower than light because multiple universe would interact with the wave, causing it to lag behind the speed of light.  Then in 2015 LIGO was built and confirmed, gravitational waves travel at the speed of light.  They do not lag behind the speed of light.  Evidence contradicting the notion of multiple / parallel universes.<br><br>Believing in multiple universe is no different than believing in the tooth fairy or boogie man at this point seeing evidence doesn&#39;t support them.   Anti-religious, blasphemous claim by man denying his creator.<br><br>I know for a fact that God is real.  I see signs of God everywhere, all the time.  I&#39;ve never seen signs of multiple universes.
Complete logical fallacy. Why do theists come to science channels to deny what is over their heads?<br>Because they have nothing supernatural to offer.<br>Think about that.

@@Goettel He tells the public total bullshit about physics.
Exactly, we never fool ourselves like in the case of experiments where we use &quot;observations&quot;, because essentially we stress the waves to the compact corpuscle to measure speed, distance, size, inner properties, which means coercion rather than distant sightsee. In fact we tear out fermionic entities from another state of essences and call it some kind of Standard Model of particle physics, but fundamentally miss the nature of categorised phenomenons, e.g. comparing bosons with fermions while they exist in different states of essences (informational or probability continuum vs time-energy continuum of states).
Could quantum entanglement (spooky action at a distance) be explained by the hypothesis that we live in a simulated universe? Specifically, could it be a result of the universe&#39;s computational mechanism only rendering what is being directly observed, in order to limit the amount of information it needs to process?&quot;
No, it can&#39;t be. Spooky action at a distance can, however, be easily explained with people not paying enough attention in science class. :-)

Dude, we got quantum mechanics right in 1927. Absolutely nothing of importance has changed since then. Nothing will change from here on, either. You can only get it right once and then it stays right. ;-)
I think we have narrowed down fundemental physics as far as we possible can do with our current tools and understanding. I truly believe that physicist need to consider and even accept that there MIGHT be an external reality to the one we experience. If the simulation theory is plausible (several aspects within physics supports this), then this could be a path to explore in order to progress.

Thus, the world itself already has many-sided (~ &quot;multi-world&quot;) and improvisational (~&quot;probabilistic&quot;) properties.<br>P.S.<br>0. &quot;Indeed, it is clear that we cannot report the translational motion of the entire universe and check whether this motion affects the course of any processes. The principle of relativity therefore has heuristic and physical meanings only if it is valid for any closed system. However, the question arises, when can a system be considered closed? Is the remoteness of all the masses outside the considered system sufficient for this? The answer, according to experience, says that in the case of uniform and rectilinear motion, this is enough, but for other movements it is not enough.<br>Summarizing, we can say that the postulate of relativity includes the statement that the uniform and rectilinear motion of the &quot;center of gravity&quot; of the Universe relative to some closed system does not affect the processes in this system.&quot; (Pauli, RT).<br>1. Obviously, the opposite is true for an expanding universe.<br>Apparently, the researcher can detect and measure the effect of the aging process in his own frame of reference caused by the phenomenon of global time t(universe)=1/H:<br>ds^ 2=c^2d—Ç^2=g(00)c^ 2dt^2=(1-Ht*)c^2dt^2, where the parameter Ht* it shows how much of the global time has &quot;passed&quot; in its own frame of reference, t* is the measurement time according to the clock of the resting observer, t is the duration of any physical process in its own frame of reference relative to the clock.<br>2.The observer can measure the increase in the duration of the processes in the laboratory frame of reference: d—Ç=[‚àö g(00)]dt=[‚àö(1-Ht*)]dt~(1-Ht*)dt&lt;dt;¬†<br>that is ‚àÜt/t=Ht*. {For example, the lifetime of a free neutron (t=878.4sec) in one year (t*=1 year) increases by: ‚àÜt=6*10^-8 sec, at H=2.2*10^-18sec.} And for t*=t, ‚àÜt=Ht^2. {For example, the duration of the Earth&#39;s rotation around the Sun per year (t=t*=1 year) increases by: ‚àÜt=2 milliseconds.}<br>In other words, ‚àÜw/w(0)=Ht*, where w(0) is the oscillation frequency of any physical periodic process, ‚àÜw is the frequency shift.<br>{For example, the frequency of the green part of the light spectrum [v(0)=5.4*10^14 Hz] will &quot;turn red&quot; for one hour (t*=1 hour) at: ‚àÜv=4.27Hz.}<br>3. ‚ÄúThus, Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity does not eliminate Newtonian absolute space; it only creates for all physics, including electrodynamics, the same position that mechanics has occupied since Newton&#39;s time.&quot; (Born, RT, chapter VI, paragraph paragraph 10).<br>4. Indeed, the SR actually eliminated only relative simultaneity, reserving the right to be simultaneous within its own frame of reference.<br>GR partially ‚Äúnotices‚Äù this problem: clock synchronization is an ambiguous procedure here and depends on the path along which it is carried out.<br>That is, RT does not eliminate simultaneity completely.<br>5. However, the observer can choose the observable Universe as his own frame of reference, and then the redshift of the spectral lines in the global/own frame of reference is characterized by the value: z= [w-w(0)]/w(0)=Hl/c, where l is the characteristic size of the frame of reference, and in this case, l=l(universe). Then in the frame of reference at t*=t(universe)=1/H for the light signal ds^2=0, therefore, we have the invariance of the speed of light c=cdl/dx(0) with respect to spontaneous Lorentz transformations.<br>That is, along the time coordinate x(0), own frame of reference turns out to be relative to itself: moreover, all subsequent states (which are equal, but not equivalent*) are causally related to each other (apparently, this circumstance leads to exotic metaphysical interpretations of quantum theory).<br>6.Introducing the concept of 4-space, a fundamental difference between time x(0) and spatial coordinates is allowed.¬†<br>It supposedly consists of the fact that along the world lines corresponding to physical processes, x(0) can only grow, whereas x(1), x(2), x(3) can change as you please.¬†<br>However,¬† the unification of spatial coordinates and time into a single manifold is not formal but is a real reflection of the picture of the world, and self-closure does not take place for the 4-line.¬†¬†<br>Apparently the time coordinate pulls along with it the spatial coordinates, because if it is impossible to return to the past, then it is also impossible to return to where &quot;there&quot; changes with the spontaneous accumulation of space-time, history.<br>7.

As you can see at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsZ1aB5egEQ&amp;t=1602">26:42</a> modern scientists plainly reject the idea that consciousness is needed to collapse the wave function etc. Sean simply mentioned that in the passing that people use to think that consciousness is needed to collapse the wave function, without even stopping and fussing over it. That is simply not the case. Deepak Chopra and woo crowd should weep.
Nobody of importance ever thought that. Anybody who talks about consciousness in physics simply doesn&#39;t understand physics.
@schmetterling4477¬† Well, Eugene Wigner,  Jon Von Neumann, and several scientists from the copenhagen group thought that consciousness collapses wave functions. Also, there are conferences on it on the FQxI channel even till recently. I hope you are aware of that.
‚Äã@@schmetterling4477 Are you sure? Then why would be there so much discussion around it?<br><br>Eugene Wigner, Jon Von Neumann and some from Copenhagen group (Werner Heisenberg - ref: Heisenberg cut) thought that an &quot;Observer&quot; that collapses the wave function has to be a conscious entity. <br><br>Even Sir Roger Penrose, along with Stuart Haremroff, think that Consciousness and QM are connected, to be fair, in a reverse way i.e. consciousness is caused by QW collapse in microtubules in neurons. BTW this stance is used by woo crowd to misrepresent that - &quot;see even Roger Penrose thinks that consciousness as QM are connected&quot;.<br><br>There are even conference discussion panels on FQxI about linking Observer to consciousness and many scientists there say that.<br><br>See the following videos on FQxI channel:<br><br>- What is an Observer? A Panel with James Hartle, Susanne Still, David Wallace, and Alan Guth<br>- The Return of the Observer by James Hartle<br><br>I think the original use of the word &quot;Observer&quot; is the primary cause of this confusion. I have written about it elsewhere.<br><br><br><br><br>BTW I obviously do not think Deepak Chopra is a scientist. But he is very popular and influential in attacking science by thousand cuts.
@schmetterling4477¬† Scientists from Copehagen group thought that. Eugene Wigner and Jon von Neumann thought that. Eugene Wigner later retracted that  David Chalmers, in collaboration with one other scientist, has a recent paper about that.
@@SandipChitale Von Neuman simply didn&#39;t understand quantum mechanics. He understood the math of quantum mechanics, but he had zero physical intuition into what is actually happening in a quantum experiment. I would have to look up the papers of Wigner to see if he had the necessary intuition or not. Schroedinger for sure did not. Neither did Einstein. Heisenberg, at one point, got it right and then he reversed course and got it completely wrong. So, no, these people are NOT important. They can&#39;t teach you what they didn&#39;t understand themselves. Mott, in his 1929 paper got it 100% right. That is the paper you have to read. <br><br>If Chalmers pushes anything related to consciousness, then he is a giant fool. <br><br>The necessary physical property pair that you need to understand is reversible/irreversible. We teach this in second your undergrad physics, most people simply aren&#39;t paying enough attention. They think these are classical properties, but that&#39;s simply not the case. What reduces quantum mechanics to classical mechanics is irreversibility. <br><br>The second thing you will have to learn (and which Einstein, in particular, also didn&#39;t understand) is that quantum mechanics is NOT a self-consistent theory as long as we are staying in the non-relativistic regime. Only relativistic QM and relativistic field theory can be made self-consistent. That, for instance, also invalidates Bell. If you actually read Bell&#39;s paper, then you will find a few sentence at the end of it in the conclusion part where he notices this himself. Most people who like Bell&#39;s result just never read the actual paper and so they don&#39;t know that Bell himself already knew better. ;-)
@schmetterling4477¬† You should discuss Bell with Tim Maudlin then.<br><br>I for one, do NOT think consciousness has anything specific to do with QM, which is what I try to remind people in these comments.<br><br>Wow, you seem to have understood QM and QFT better than many top scientists.<br><br>The question still is what causes (spontaneous?) irreversible process when the so-called measurement happens?

I would just like to say a massive thank you to everyone involved in this production and freely giving us these interesting discussions.‚ù§
Those scientists preaching this manyworld-theory do not believe in it themselves, but they want you to believe in order to sidetrack your thinking from reality. The theory is not simple at all, because it implies a very complex and huge mechanism whereby the universe splits up in myriads new universes by each little quantum interaction. The theory does not explain how this mechanism works. It actually changes a complex theoretical problem for an immensely more complex theoretical problem that is not mentioned. It also implies that each little interaction grows to something so huge that there is virtually no measure for it. The theory is pure nonsense, but it is effective as a psychological mind-trap.
There is nothing complex about MWI. You can find the mistake that leads to it in the second sentence of Everett&#39;s thesis.
@@schmetterling4477 The thinking behind the interpretation is not complex, but implies a very huge and complex mechanism that they do not speak about, but must know about.
@@knutholt3486 A logical mistake doesn&#39;t imply anything. It&#39;s simply a logical mistake. Everett literally thought that 1=infinity. The man couldn&#39;t count.
Thank you.  There is ample evidence that humans are prone to this type of confusion.  We love to push problems a &quot;turtle&quot; away.  I wish these confused physicists would talk with scholars outside their discipline once in a while.  Understanding how our minds work is also fundamental to understanding reality.
@@netscrooge How would a scholar outside of physics know how physics works? Most of them can&#39;t even remember the high school definition of energy. Can you? ;-)
@@schmetterling4477 Don&#39;t be silly.  Clearly I&#39;m suggesting that the scholars outside of physics can help physicists recognize human cognitive errors/traps. <br><br>Some seem to believe that having a brain that&#39;s good at advanced mathematics automatically means it&#39;s good at everything.  In psychology that&#39;s called magical thinking.  In reality, some physicists are better at philosophy than others.  Turok&#39;s turn in thinking and Hossenfelder&#39;s &quot;lost in math&quot; are examples of better big-picture reasoning.  The many-worlds hypothesis is the opposite of that.  The original comment hits the nail on the head; it&#39;s obviously a psychological mind-trap.  I would go further and suggest that the many-worlds hypothesis is today&#39;s greatest example of where philosophy of science is being ignored.

Maybe I am dense but it&#39;s the first time I have heard the implicit explanation of why entanglement is the ultimate weird phenomenon, namely the fact that the function wave of the non-observed particle also collapses the very moment when the observed particle&#39;s does.
Yes, you just heard a lot of bullshit. Wave functions don&#39;t collapse at all. They are not even physical phenomena. Entanglement, OTOH, is a trivial consequence of relativity and spacetime symmetries. Most people simply don&#39;t understand why it can&#39;t be any other way than this... but a lack of understanding doesn&#39;t create physics. It only creates people who are poorly educated.
Simulation people what do you have to say to the universe obeying a simple wave function that has nothing else outside of it.<br>The probabilities of every outcome happen at light speed, so you cannot have a No Go Theorem to program the outcomes in spacetime while the universe has already evolved. <br>Maybe in Hilbert space before it emerges into classical spacetime. However, implementing such a simulation would be highly complex and currently beyond our technological capabilities.
I don‚Äôt think simulation people have anything to say because they don‚Äôt seem to think too hard about the scenario.

We don&#39;t understand Quantum Mechanics. We only know how to calculcate. This is the equivalent to a mathematical equation in school you learned to do the right steps, to get the end result. But you would not understand why and what is actually happening. Still get best rating for.

When will the vast majority of QM-scientists grasp being part of the biggest scientific failure ever in history? When will they stop making idiotic papers on top of papers?

Quantum Entanglement could be the reason a particle looses its wave like behaviour. Let me explain, In a double split experiment the particle behaves as a wave until it is observed, the observer(Human or a detector) is also made of particles which has a Quantum state. When a particle in the double split experiment is observed,  the wave like behaviour is lost because of the quantum state of the observer. This means in the classic world all the particles doesn&#39;t have their wave like behaviour because of Entanglement of observer. Which means Entanglement is not one of the property but it is the property how Quantum Physics works.

It just is that we as humans can&#39;t accept that propability rules our reality. However we accept that for dice, coins and cards without asuming many worlds existence. Like we easily accept and understand imaginary numbers in electrical circuits but not in quantum mechanics. Maybe propability and complex numbers themselfs is what we refuse to accept?
Probability is ultimately deterministic.  It just looks otherwise.
That‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre discussing in this video at all.

On the contrary, the development of quantum computers is the working proof of Many Worlds and the incorrectness of the indeterminist &#39;quantum uncertainty&#39; nonsense. Quantum computers are here now doing calculations possible only because they interact with the multiverse.

I love Brian and Sean, both very smart, often humble, and able to communicate complex science with not an ounce of pretence or condescension. I‚Äôm purely interested in the deep, epistemological questions of reality, and so the fact that both of these guys delve into ‚Äúpot head‚Äù questions with vigour, is refreshing. They are both clearly creative and curious, as well as being academically gifted
Einstein said if you can‚Äôt explain your theories to a 9 year old they are not good theories.
So it becomes a &quot;pot head&quot; question if one questions ‚Äúorthodoxy‚Äù.  An orthodoxy that in someways is extremely ‚Äúeffective‚Äù and in other ways is clearly incomplete and incompatible between the two ‚Äúpillars‚Äù of this orthodoxy.  So it is solely the domain of the &quot;pot heads&quot; to question ‚Äúreality‚Äù &amp; the underlying mechanisms‚ÄΩ That case Elon should have all the answers.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsZ1aB5egEQ&amp;t=372">6:12</a> Brian talks about &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; dogma that basically discouraged scientists to look at the problem of measurement in QM. And in fact that problem is glossed over in the Physics text books as Sean later mentioned (at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsZ1aB5egEQ&amp;t=480">8:00</a>). I think this should be unacceptable in science. And IMO this has been a serious sociological issue that basically was skipped over by the science community. Sean laments about this at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsZ1aB5egEQ&amp;t=1849">30:49</a>. We may have missed the next Einstein during that period who could have solved it. The lesson is that scientific community should never again ever allow such dogmas of not asking the &quot;why?&quot; questions to take hold. Luckily many scientists (like Sean) and Philosophers  (like Tim Maudlin and David Albert) now reject the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; dogma and press on to try to solve the measurement problem. They should be extremely lauded.<br><br>BTW the  &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; dogma took hold because Neils Bohr and Copenhagen Interpretation wing won the PR battle against Einstein and Schrodinger. Read all about it in Adam Baker&#39;s book &quot;What is real?&quot;<br><br>I feel that the same effect is happening in the area of understanding of consciousness research due to the so-called &quot;Hard problem of consciousness&quot; dogma due to David Chalmers. Just like &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; dogma was rejected, so should reject the &quot;Hard problem of consciousness&quot; dogma be rejected. Luckily many scientists (like Anil Seth and Michael Graziano) and Philosophers  (like Daniel Dennett (did :( )) reject the &quot;Hard problem of consciousness&quot; dogma and press on to try to solve the understanding of consciousness. They should be extremely lauded.

I didn‚Äôt follow Sean‚Äôs answer about probability.  Need to look that up.
There are (say) 10 different universes containing lonely cubicle.<br>These universes are all a little different. But the 10 different versions of you are identical, except each of you is in a different universe (=quantum wave).There is no &#39;quantum uncertainty or probability&#39;. What happens to each of the 10 versions of you is already predetermined within each of these 10 universes. But from your perspective, you don&#39;t know at this point which universe the particular version of the 10 you are, is in.  <br><br>All nonsense ? Check out quantum computers. They do calculations  massively quicker that conventional computers because they &#39;borrow&#39; (i.e interact) with parallel universes<br>to do the calculations. And quantum computing (before it became a reality) was predicted by the great champion of the multiverse, Daniel Dennett.

So nice to hear an expert of a field be interviewed by another expert of the same field who is just trying to get the information out for the audience.
yes but the difference is that Brian has also journalist qualities
What do other experts , in the same field think ? From other theories .
@@philharmer198 <br>There are many understandings of how quantum mechanics works that gives the result we see in nature using mathematics to describe.  I like interviewers who draw out the thinking of their guest instead of debating.

If you are here and interested in listening to this stuff you are probably an intellectual.   You are interested in abstracts stuff.  You are interested in finding out more about a few things or many things that you know a little about.   Some people are very focused in their curiosity. Others want to know about anything that catches their fancy and many things catches their fancy. <br><br>But there are people with no interest in stuff that they don‚Äôt know much about.  They want certainty of knowing what they know, and to admit that they don‚Äôt know and what they don‚Äôt know can affect their lives?  They just jump to a conclusion (back to certainty) and then get angry when you tell them it‚Äôs complicated. <br><br>That behaviour is most evident during Covid.  Snatching at the silver bullets of ivermectin or hydroxychloquinne &amp; getting angry when scientists say: the tests and trials are not showing the results you want.
@@lamdao1242  Good post . Really .
‚Äã@@lamdao1242To politely, and slightly disagree. Though I do often agree with your point, that some people would tend to rather just have an answer, than to say I/we don&#39;t know. I also think there is a greater tendency in the COVID example: Naive Realism. In the sciences it would be something like the way we see color. The red apple is not actually red. (For simplicity and brevity&#39;s sake) It is absorbing photons at all frequencies other than red, and reflecting those red photons away. So in reality the red apple is all colors except red. But you and I don&#39;t think of it that way, our naivety makes it so that to us the Apple is red, and so it becomes real to us as a red apple.¬†<br><br><br>In the psycho-social realm Naive Realism stems from the idea that most of us tend to see ourselves as rational, moral, unbiased, and knowledgeable (when talking about something we care about). We view this in ourself as real, even when it may not be. Therefore when someone has an opposing viewpoint, we tend to view it as due to being irrational, biased, immoral, or ignorant.<br><br><br>So we tend to see the flaws more and disregard the strengths in our opponents&#39; views, and vice versa we see the strengths in the views of people who align with us, and just disregard the flaws.<br><br><br>If you agree with someone&#39;s overall point and they say something that isn&#39;t true, you tend to think of it as: they misspoke, or that point isn&#39;t that important to the overall point, or just let it slide altogether. If the person you disagree with says something that isn&#39;t true, they are a liar, are spreading misinformation, can&#39;t be trusted, etc.<br><br><br>So for instance, probably about a decade ago, there was a new president at some university, I think it was in Ohio. This group of researchers ran a study where they had a few hundred students and faculty read an article about her. The majority of the article was basically an introduction saying who she was, what her qualifications were, her mission statement for the school in the future, simple PR stuff, you can&#39;t love her or hate her. Then at the end there were three different versions of the article, with three different opinions of affirmative action, one pro, one anti, one non-committal. The subjects, prior to reading the article were asked their opinions on affirmative action. People who read versions where they agreed with her tended to not see any bias.<br><br><br>People who read versions where they disagreed with her, would point out how being a female, or being white, or being 60 plus years old, or being ivy league educated, was a biasing Factor.<br><br><br>So basically the result is if someone agrees with you, you don&#39;t see the fact that they&#39;re a woman, white, ivy league educated, certain age, as a biasing factor. You only see it if they disagree with you. Harvard educated means she knows what she&#39;s talking about as long as she agrees with me. If she disagrees with me, then it means shes a wealthy, privileged, elitist who doesn&#39;t care about those who are not, or it means shes part of the leftist, liberal, hive mind.¬†<br><br><br>We tend to engage positively with what we already agree with, and negatively with what we already disagree with.¬†<br><br><br>I think in covid, it was more of: I think the situation is overblown, so I&#39;m going to align with the side that agrees with me. Or I think this is an extremely serious situation, so I&#39;m going to align with the side that agrees with me. Or I align with the left or right, so I&#39;m going to innately agree with that side on covid related issues as well.<br><br><br>Now once I have my side, it means therefore the other side is wrong, biased, immoral, or irrational.

‚Äã@SpaceMogLuna I agree, if many worlds were the final solution, every single particle interaction would have to somehow create enough energy to literally split spacetime into infinitely increasing numbers of worlds. Where would all that energy come from? It&#39;s just too much. I don&#39;t see a problem with the unlocalized hidden variables they were discussing near the end. That seems like a reasonable alternative which still culminates in a single world/universe. Though I have to say I honestly would love for the many worlds theory to be true. It just sounds so simple, yet elegant the way Sean describes it.

Different Physicists will appeal to different people, many people would tell you Neil Degrasse is, he doesn&#39;t do it for me but for people with little understanding of physics he is great.

penrose says he doesnt believe in the many worlds and explains  very well why, and why QM is not a complete theory. enough for me.
@@mehridin QM is a complete theory. Penrose is simply not sufficiently familiar with it because of his advanced age (the way he was taught in his youth doesn&#39;t cover the necessary aspects). Quantum mechanics follows directly from Kolmogorov&#39;s axioms for ensembles of independent experiments and relativity. So unless you can find a problem with either, QM is what it is. From a practical point of view Kolmogorov can be verified experimentally up to nonsensical assumptions like superdeterminism and the hand of god and we have not seen any violation of relativity either, so far. One has to step squarely outside of the definition of science to find a fault with QM.
For me, the many worlds interpretation is by far the most intuitive. If you accept that entanglement is a real phenomenon then it should not come as a surprise that you yourself can get entangled with a quantum system.
You must think in terms of relativity to expansive matter meaning time is a sub factor of the potentiality
Okay let the liberals decide
@@mcg6762 Entanglement is not a phenomenon. Entanglement is the absence of a causal phenomenon. It&#39;s the consequence of a symmetry. You are simply not used to thinking that the absence of phenomena has deep consequences because we don&#39;t teach that kind of reasoning to you in K-12.
‚Å†@@schmetterling4477I can‚Äôt find Everett‚Äôs 1957 thesis. Where is it online?
@@declandougan7243 YouTube won&#39;t let me post a link, but I never had trouble finding it. The main gist is that he claims that the wave function is the complete description of a quantum mechanical system. That is simply not true. The wave function doesn&#39;t say anything about an individual quantum system. It gives us the average behavior of the unmeasured quantum mechanical ensemble. If we want to have the description of an actual frequentist measurement (the only kind of measurement one can do in quantum mechanics), then we need the wave function AND the spectral operator for the measurement system. What that gives us is a probability distribution for our frequentist measurement outcomes. <br><br>His mistake basically claims that the description of the entire forest (plus ranger station) is contained in the shape of every single tree. It&#39;s this misidentification of the multiplicity of the theory that blows up the number of worlds by a factor of infinity. To put it mildly: the man couldn&#39;t count. To him one was equal to infinity and vice versa.
@@schmetterling4477 Why did such a respectable physicist as wheeler let him publish this?
@@declandougan7243 You will have to ask Wheeler. What I can say is that a lot of physicists honestly seem to think that the wave function is a single system dynamic evolution state function. The language in a lot of standard textbooks can be mistaken that way. As long as people &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; that&#39;s of no consequence, because they are effectively treating the wave function as the ensemble description that it really is anyway. The ontological problem only occurs if somebody doesn&#39;t understand what Copenhagen does in the first place and then tries to &quot;correct&quot; it or &quot;improve&quot; it. That&#39;s when strange intellectual constructs like MWI pop up. <br><br>The only problem we have with QM, to be honest, is poor teaching habits. The theory can be derived rationally from first principles without any of the giant foam hand wave mechanics handwaving that dominates most QM 101 courses to this day. Most physics professors just don&#39;t care to present such a derivation, for all I can tell. They were taught a lot of nonsense about the foundations of QM themselves but in practice they known how to use the theory and that&#39;s what they try to &quot;hand down&quot; to their students: a useful cookbook of mostly ad hoc recipes that make an OK pie.
‚Äã‚Äã@@schmetterling4477obviously both a dishonest and invalid argument to say that Penrose simply doesn&#39;t &quot;understand&quot; QM, but to then conclude that it is due to &quot;advanced age&quot; ‚Äî that&#39;s new. He understands is better than most phycisists, but unlike most phycisists, he is not programmed by scientific dogma. And that&#39;s why he is also, despite his &quot;advanced age&quot;, also one of the greatest scientific thinkers of our time. Not to forget, he has actually argued why, contrary to your silly assertions. And he is one of history&#39;s greatest physicists, also unlike you. And finally, he didn&#39;t hear about QM after reaching your so called advanced age; these are arguments he has had for decades.
@@mehridin Penrose is an old man. He peddles one good idea CCC (which I think will turn out to be correct to some extent) but the rest of what he says is garbage. You don&#39;t have to take my word for it. There is plenty of literature that you could read that contradicts him. Don&#39;t let your intellectual laziness get in your way, though. ;-)
Wow thank you so much great proud of you sir..
You can grind on metal or rock and make a lot of electrons sparks. Friction causes electrons to appear when exchanging renewable energy singularities. Internal magnetic fields grounding currents into itself through the nucleus. Sparks of electrons striking singularities out in renewable energy exchanging positions. Mass grounding currents into itself and greater magnetic fields are internal magnetic fields grounding currents into itself as mass. Trickle down currents into earth&#39;s magnetic field currents. Weak external magnetic fields like space itself filled with energy throughout as dark energy outside of entanglement of mass. External magnetic field potentially renewable energy striking mass. Gravity doesn&#39;t work because mass is outward force of pressure outside of a greater magnetic field as weightless. Internal quantum magnetic fields synchronizantion with earth&#39;s magnetic fields currents grounding as magnetism is grounding currents towards the greater magnetic field. Synchronization of magnetic fields as force of weight. Magnetism bonding force of pressure. The farther away from earth&#39;s magnetic field, the force of weight is less. Gravity doesn&#39;t exist. Magnetism does and you can observe it. Mass is always equal to force and distance traveling equalization. Force of weight. Mass falls in equalization to pressure within and without entanglement. No matter how much it weighs or its density it falls in equalization to resistance within and without entanglement.  Gravity would pull greater mass harder. It doesn&#39;t happen because mass is energy equal to force and distance traveling in magnetic fields. Energy doesn&#39;t collapse in on itself. Mass is energy in internal quantum magnetic fields. Educated idiots who do alot of speculation without proof of physics. Gravity hasn&#39;t been proven. It&#39;s a suggestion. Magnetic fields are real and quantum magnetic fields cycle circulation patterns through the nucleus just like earth&#39;s magnetic field through it core. External magnetic fields don&#39;t ground or pass through the nucleus of absolute zero energy within. External magnetic fields cycle circulation outside of the sphere perimeter as pure repulsion of space.  Normally space is filled with dark energy outside of entanglement of mass. External magnetic fields are the cores of galaxies rotating space itself in its magnetic field. There is only one of each thing. Differences are inevitable and no two states can be reproduced exactly the same way same spot. Magnetic fields show repulsion to propulsion from repulsion. Force of pressure. Perpetual motion. Unification of unidirectional flow cycling circulation of internal and external magnetic fields. Internal magnetic fields grounding currents sharing force as grounding or bonding force of pressure. Theoretically factual probability that works with quantum physics without gravity.
