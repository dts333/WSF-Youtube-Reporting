Just thinking, how shocked and ecstatic Einstein would have gotten if he was alive to truly witness the discovery of black holes. Especially when they regarded it as not realistic even when the math worked out
Has anyone heard the song Cygnus x-1 Book 1 on “A Farewell to Kings” by Rush?

Really now? You speak about science (theory, experiment, proof) while all you do is theory and visualizations.
If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>“The greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↓α is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2. Second Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of  Quantum Anti-Gravity.<br><br>“The lesser mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes an upward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”                                                                                            <br>                                                                                                  -Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br>  <br>Where:<br><br>QAG is Quantum Anti-Gravity in Rovira (value of upward acceleration force due to quantum anti-gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in lesser mass density of Quantum Anti-Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑α is the Resultant Upward Acceleration of Anti-Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>3. Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>“The equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑↓0α is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Copyright 2022 ROEL REAL ROVIRA.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?
Amazing
My bad
Oh
Enjoyable
20 dishes? That&#39;s a lot of washing up.
Congratulations 🔭🪐✨
And when i started thinking and seeeing SCIENCE  related VIDEOS then  i don&#39;t see time . <br>I forget everything infront of this .
Physics is just amazing so so Amazing Every time when i think about physics,it blows up my mind This universe is so mysterious  really.
I&#39;m more convinced with Andrea Ghez data than his subjective impression of the radio data even though he obviously wants to take the credit of discovering black holes in galaxies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=923">15:23</a> No high speed internet on the planet beats out a 747 filled with hard drives?? Scuse me?
Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Brian Greene is a Genius!
Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!👏👏👏<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.
An Object Falls Due To Said Object Being More Dense Than The Space Around It. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH, &quot;Gravity&quot; 😆
&quot;Gravity&quot; Is A THEORY And Does... Not... Exist. You&#39;re Welcome.
Love that he wears a pin with the image of the black hole on
Boring
If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! 👏
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name
Not a  pic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=660">11:00</a>
The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I’d give you one thousand dishes. Brian’s a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.
Omg even Greene is saying that new habit people are doing in spoken language…. ‘right?” After every four words
I miss the discussion panel though 😢
Essentially, he simulated a Solar Eclipse on a Black Hole instead of the Sun in order to get a picture of it🤓
Fantastic lecture and looking forward to the next discoveries maybe to be developed to better and peaceful species !
How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind
Hahaha black holes 🕳
Fucking Democrats ruined World Science Festival by banning live audience.
Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?
Black holes don&#39;t exist
What if we are a experiment by advanced human civilization that set us out here to see how we would advance or how long it would take us to figure out the universe
I love living in these awakening times where technology has overtaken the lies we’ve been indoctrinated with! which has closed most peoples minds ♥️😎<br>The legendary Nikon P 900 camera with phenomenal zoom shows us why that little star twinkle twinkles and so much more but look on YouTube for ‘ Mars Nikon P 900‘ and realise fElony Musk can’t shoot his load to a luminary in our sky! <br>Betelgeuse Nikon P 900 is a strange one but have a look for any light in the sky like Saturn with what looks like it could have a total ring around it which our minds perceive to be true 😉<br>If the lights we see are just that then the rest of the supposed universe is up for debate 😆<br>Black holes? Nah!
Not only is the guest intelligent but so is the host!
The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different
I can&#39;t believe I sat through an hour interview about a blurry blackhole picture, and enjoyed every moment of it.
Please share with other people my two brief videos. Thanks!!
Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.
I&#39;m really puzzled and trying to reach for an understanding on the conjunction of the time factor at the event horizon......I can&#39;t get it🤪
Using advancing computing power to push the envelope on seeing deeper into the cosmos. Outstanding 👍
#5.3👍Is there a natural size limit for these things?  🤷
Is it speculated that photons have something like DNA, the thing that relates the two created entangled photons?
For a lot of us armchair science nuts Mr Greene brings us generational updated fascinating insights into modern day physics. Sorry for lack of comma’s 😅
I’m so glad I’m alive now and not 100 years ago🤛👏👏
That&#39;s not an actual picture of our black hole now is it it&#39;s computer rendition of it isn&#39;t it
So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right
Believe I am &quot;black holed&quot; out.  Next topic. ; maybe how to get from a to b w/o getting shot by a felon they just caught and released two minutes ago.  Defund the Democrats  and save the world.
Okay that explains those black holes but how do you get a device IP address into a black hole device status how does that happen this is a real question
What is the first thing they say about a black hole? Answer not even light can escape the gravity of a black hole!!! They are conducting themselves again!!!
Absolutely incredible interview!. Thank you.
Mr. Greene ♥️♥️♥️
Shep  Doeleman  is an amazing smart person.
Want to see them at kids scales since there a magnetic strand to mass you can see them with magnet iron or new neodymium if you split them there bind by a atomic particle line if you watch on YouTube or if you have the material you may see the very centre and on old bar magnet if you get the iron fine and just right from the top poles out you can see the second hole and at the very centre a small bend at the very centre I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like a transformer air gap or impurities at the join but I&#39;ve repeated this with new N42 neodymium and a rubber to hold them apart the magnetic field interaction with the fabric feild interact if you get it just right also showing a gauze line to the material magnet and a bind at the centre you can check there safe!. While I finish up a 3rd in a more fluid setup 😃😄😁😆😅 5 Smile&#39;s and you missed the fabric dimension antimatter?and the space count or the charge as your +/- very similar to a circuit?? Want to hold it cheaper than a magnetic field sonic ultra sonic?????and on a neutron star is that gas not moving 😁. Answer that question??.
I&#39;m just kinda wandering if there is an end point of the universe.. where there is no more star planet I mean nothing ..
We need another breakthrough “Person”… our perception of dimensions is limited to our reality and we can’t study the outside of our simple space-time.<br><br>… it’s frustrating.
What is Black Hole and how much close to earth?<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-LG30NFWg">https://youtu.be/5q-LG30NFWg</a>

neat!
excellent
I don&#39;t know about you but I find it very exciting to think of what&#39;s to come in the future; close-up photos, videos, more data on size, etc ! The only painful thing is that I won&#39;t be here to see most of all of that. Mortality really sucks the big one sometimes !
I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.
Enjoyed that largely because I could understand it, and that is down to the language employed and the presentation ,an absolutely fantastic show.
I&#39;M maho Jupiter&#39;jesus God Son 🌹
The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus. I also believe they know this and plan on jumping because they know earth will move out the goldilocks zone and Venus in. Yea I know it&#39;s crazy but adds up. Call me Noah 🤣
How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.
If we use Newton&#39;s language and time is only a parameter, how close can we describe the unescapable force of the event horizon? <br><br>We don&#39;t have space turning to time, instead we need to assume what? Do things just disappear from the universe disobeying thermodynamics, or is it just fuzzy-math-really-really-super-strong?
Is there some way to see those four different renders that each team came up with, for m87?
A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

Decent, patient, knowledgeable, humble, understanding; unlike interviews we all see on TV with news anchors, where they cut off, brush aside and talk over interviewees.

the fact that they&#39;re going to have actual videos and pictures of the first disk is insane, comparing it to the black hole in interstellar is a good in my opinion because seeing the thing from the movie in real physical life would be pretty insane

Spectacular images, which lead the curiosity to wander from the viewpoint <br>- if telescopes were to capture imagery from a sidereal vantage point, what changes? <br><br>Appreciating the wonderful work that&#39;s been conducted to date, but the size of planet Earth in relation to the observed suggests that the data will be limited - not only in clarity but also in content.

How could a range of telescopes be created to capture imagery from a vantage point sidereal to the black hole?<br>2. How far beyond (behind) a black hole could a telescopic camera be placed?<br>3. The double slit experiment shows that a photon can be in two places at once, so can the same be done with a teeny-tiny camera? <br><br>No apologies for being &#39;wildly&#39; imaginative<br><br>Thank you again World Science Festival!

What does &quot;black hole spin&quot; even mean?  This has confused me since I was a kid.
The more I hear about the &quot;chicken &amp; egg&quot; co-evolution of black holes &amp; galactic formation, the less I see a need for some invisible hand that &quot;holds&quot; stars &amp; galactic structures together.... not the least because the latter has such a disregard for the majesty of GR itself (which is that the distortion of space-time is a direct function of mass/energy itself.. with black holes &amp; the Big Bang themselves being a set of very specific categorical examples, even if GR itself breaks down in the jurisdictions of both phenomena). <br><br>I think from good ole Fritz Zwicky on down to the current crop of post doc &quot;dark matter&quot; hunters... everyone needs to just take a little break from their relentless and, very likely, futile hunt for that invisible particle. <br><br>What they attributed to Mr. Invisible --- a &quot;particle&quot; that must be at least as indifferent to baryon but is even more ubiquitous that isn&#39;t anywhere to be found, in reality (likely because it doesn&#39;t exist) --- may just be a natural by-product of large structural phenomena.

Seeing the unseeable, isn’t that kinda like brainwashing? Don’t pay attention to what you see, hear and feel, just believe what we’re saying, because science, hypothesis, flask, Bunsen burner!   It’s quite amazing how you can watch a science festival and hear nothing but pseudoscience. Astronomy? Cosmology? Astrophysics? Evolution? The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking… once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can’t control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can’t control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you’re still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there’s a gravity-like force that’s infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can’t stay in any one moment in time and can’t move through time… Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.  But I seem to remember that there was a threshold size that when reached would initiate the beginning of a black hole&#39;s evaporation. Anyway, I would like to see a video about the life span of black holes.
Massive news by any measure. ‘If I was trapped on a desert island I would chose these two black holes’ 🤣🤣 I’m proud of being a geek.. takes one to know one, and only a geek could make such a statement lol, now I hope he gets some sleep 😳 😴

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me. Before you out yourself as a, &quot;stuffed-shirt expert,&quot; know where I come from, crazy is a compliment. So to those who think me crazy, Thank You.  As it should be

This was really well done. It would be interesting for one of these physicists to do an interview about the dynamics around a black hole.

I love to see a video that goes a little deeper into the strangeness of a black hole, without getting into too much math. IDK.   My thoughts anyway.

It&#39;s a great work! But how can you assure that what you see from the radio telescope is a real black hole?
From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.
This made me cry tears of joy. Humanity is so amazing sometimes! We found and proved something even Einstein thought was beyond possibility. 🥲

Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated.

Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.

@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = μ/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I love learning that they&#39;ve been able to use data from multiple telescopes across the world to create higher resolution information than any one of the telescopes can alone. Interferometry has been used for many years at the Very Large Array telescope in western New Mexico. I&#39;m happy to hear that similar technology has been expanded to encompass the world. I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

@@mehridin Absolutely. Although at times I have difficulty explaining my thought process to the majority of linear thinkers (not derogatorily used here) and I notice that it is conversely true too, they have difficulty either understanding or transferring their information to me. My fuzzy logic is difficult to translate, and most of lateral thinkers and visual thinkers have their own version so there is hardly any consistent way to learn or translate. Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to. Occupational hazard of being a lateral/visual thinker.

@@blackrockerchic17 cool
Cygnus X1 is probably the nearest BH ,about 6000 LY from Earth.
The gravitational pull is proportional to the mass of a given black hole, just like any other stellar bodies.. e.g. if our sun becomes a black hole, which it won&#39;t, the orbits of our planets won&#39;t get affected.

Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
∆ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

Hey up Brian,  to see you, to see you nice 👍
but the premise that it&#39;s gravity is all off. Einstein himself admitted close to death that he did not have the answer, but Tesla did. And that is why the USA has confiscated all Tesla&#39;s patents, papers and experiments into archives the public is never likely to see.

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question 🧩
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !
I really want to attend live WSF 😄
This guy is Bob Saget&#39;s genius doppelganger XD
Geeeeeee What an achievement, and as time passes Einstein brilliant becomes more and more profound
He was always profound...it just took the world 100 years to realise it.
Time and light disappear beyond sight. But we don’t need time or light where we’re going. They are nothing more than shackles holding us back. Like the black hole, unshackled
good job nasa you spent 10 bil to capture an image strikingly similar to that of 500 years ago nice

❓recycles the universe
Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy
Like most things about the Universe around us! We have no clue!!!
Zero Theorum  everything must equal 0  ? Lol
Why humility? Awe, ok, excitement, yes but why humility? Just curious.🤔
​It is time for Shep Doeleman to, like Andrea Ghez, win a Nobel prize. Also, they are both, like Brian, fun to listen
I love how science is catching up with all the universal visions  I’ve had. It’s so reassuring.

Just thinking, how shocked and ecstatic Einstein would have gotten if he was alive to truly witness the discovery of black holes. Especially when they regarded it as not realistic even when the math worked out

Really now? You speak about science (theory, experiment, proof) while all you do is theory and visualizations.
If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>“The greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↓α is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2. Second Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of  Quantum Anti-Gravity.<br><br>“The lesser mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes an upward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”                                                                                            <br>                                                                                                  -Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br>  <br>Where:<br><br>QAG is Quantum Anti-Gravity in Rovira (value of upward acceleration force due to quantum anti-gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in lesser mass density of Quantum Anti-Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑α is the Resultant Upward Acceleration of Anti-Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>3. Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>“The equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑↓0α is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Copyright 2022 ROEL REAL ROVIRA.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?
Amazing
My bad
Oh
Enjoyable
20 dishes? That&#39;s a lot of washing up.
Congratulations 🔭🪐✨
And when i started thinking and seeeing SCIENCE  related VIDEOS then  i don&#39;t see time . <br>I forget everything infront of this .
Physics is just amazing so so Amazing Every time when i think about physics,it blows up my mind This universe is so mysterious  really.
I&#39;m more convinced with Andrea Ghez data than his subjective impression of the radio data even though he obviously wants to take the credit of discovering black holes in galaxies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=923">15:23</a> No high speed internet on the planet beats out a 747 filled with hard drives?? Scuse me?
Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Brian Greene is a Genius!
Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!👏👏👏<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.
An Object Falls Due To Said Object Being More Dense Than The Space Around It. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH, &quot;Gravity&quot; 😆
&quot;Gravity&quot; Is A THEORY And Does... Not... Exist. You&#39;re Welcome.
Love that he wears a pin with the image of the black hole on
Boring
If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! 👏
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name
Not a  pic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=660">11:00</a>
The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I’d give you one thousand dishes. Brian’s a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.
Omg even Greene is saying that new habit people are doing in spoken language…. ‘right?” After every four words
I miss the discussion panel though 😢
Essentially, he simulated a Solar Eclipse on a Black Hole instead of the Sun in order to get a picture of it🤓
Fantastic lecture and looking forward to the next discoveries maybe to be developed to better and peaceful species !
How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind
Hahaha black holes 🕳
Fucking Democrats ruined World Science Festival by banning live audience.
Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?
Black holes don&#39;t exist
What if we are a experiment by advanced human civilization that set us out here to see how we would advance or how long it would take us to figure out the universe
I love living in these awakening times where technology has overtaken the lies we’ve been indoctrinated with! which has closed most peoples minds ♥️😎<br>The legendary Nikon P 900 camera with phenomenal zoom shows us why that little star twinkle twinkles and so much more but look on YouTube for ‘ Mars Nikon P 900‘ and realise fElony Musk can’t shoot his load to a luminary in our sky! <br>Betelgeuse Nikon P 900 is a strange one but have a look for any light in the sky like Saturn with what looks like it could have a total ring around it which our minds perceive to be true 😉<br>If the lights we see are just that then the rest of the supposed universe is up for debate 😆<br>Black holes? Nah!
Not only is the guest intelligent but so is the host!
The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different
I can&#39;t believe I sat through an hour interview about a blurry blackhole picture, and enjoyed every moment of it.
Please share with other people my two brief videos. Thanks!!
Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.
I&#39;m really puzzled and trying to reach for an understanding on the conjunction of the time factor at the event horizon......I can&#39;t get it🤪
Using advancing computing power to push the envelope on seeing deeper into the cosmos. Outstanding 👍
#5.3👍Is there a natural size limit for these things?  🤷
Is it speculated that photons have something like DNA, the thing that relates the two created entangled photons?
For a lot of us armchair science nuts Mr Greene brings us generational updated fascinating insights into modern day physics. Sorry for lack of comma’s 😅
I’m so glad I’m alive now and not 100 years ago🤛👏👏
That&#39;s not an actual picture of our black hole now is it it&#39;s computer rendition of it isn&#39;t it
So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right
Believe I am &quot;black holed&quot; out.  Next topic. ; maybe how to get from a to b w/o getting shot by a felon they just caught and released two minutes ago.  Defund the Democrats  and save the world.
Okay that explains those black holes but how do you get a device IP address into a black hole device status how does that happen this is a real question
What is the first thing they say about a black hole? Answer not even light can escape the gravity of a black hole!!! They are conducting themselves again!!!
Absolutely incredible interview!. Thank you.
Mr. Greene ♥️♥️♥️
Shep  Doeleman  is an amazing smart person.
Want to see them at kids scales since there a magnetic strand to mass you can see them with magnet iron or new neodymium if you split them there bind by a atomic particle line if you watch on YouTube or if you have the material you may see the very centre and on old bar magnet if you get the iron fine and just right from the top poles out you can see the second hole and at the very centre a small bend at the very centre I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like a transformer air gap or impurities at the join but I&#39;ve repeated this with new N42 neodymium and a rubber to hold them apart the magnetic field interaction with the fabric feild interact if you get it just right also showing a gauze line to the material magnet and a bind at the centre you can check there safe!. While I finish up a 3rd in a more fluid setup 😃😄😁😆😅 5 Smile&#39;s and you missed the fabric dimension antimatter?and the space count or the charge as your +/- very similar to a circuit?? Want to hold it cheaper than a magnetic field sonic ultra sonic?????and on a neutron star is that gas not moving 😁. Answer that question??.
I&#39;m just kinda wandering if there is an end point of the universe.. where there is no more star planet I mean nothing ..
We need another breakthrough “Person”… our perception of dimensions is limited to our reality and we can’t study the outside of our simple space-time.<br><br>… it’s frustrating.
What is Black Hole and how much close to earth?<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-LG30NFWg">https://youtu.be/5q-LG30NFWg</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1296">21:36</a> do what now?! :D
neat!
excellent
I don&#39;t know about you but I find it very exciting to think of what&#39;s to come in the future; close-up photos, videos, more data on size, etc ! The only painful thing is that I won&#39;t be here to see most of all of that. Mortality really sucks the big one sometimes !
I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.
Enjoyed that largely because I could understand it, and that is down to the language employed and the presentation ,an absolutely fantastic show.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus. I also believe they know this and plan on jumping because they know earth will move out the goldilocks zone and Venus in. Yea I know it&#39;s crazy but adds up. Call me Noah 🤣
How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.
If we use Newton&#39;s language and time is only a parameter, how close can we describe the unescapable force of the event horizon? <br><br>We don&#39;t have space turning to time, instead we need to assume what? Do things just disappear from the universe disobeying thermodynamics, or is it just fuzzy-math-really-really-super-strong?

A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

What does &quot;black hole spin&quot; even mean?  This has confused me since I was a kid.
The more I hear about the &quot;chicken &amp; egg&quot; co-evolution of black holes &amp; galactic formation, the less I see a need for some invisible hand that &quot;holds&quot; stars &amp; galactic structures together.... not the least because the latter has such a disregard for the majesty of GR itself (which is that the distortion of space-time is a direct function of mass/energy itself.. with black holes &amp; the Big Bang themselves being a set of very specific categorical examples, even if GR itself breaks down in the jurisdictions of both phenomena). <br><br>I think from good ole Fritz Zwicky on down to the current crop of post doc &quot;dark matter&quot; hunters... everyone needs to just take a little break from their relentless and, very likely, futile hunt for that invisible particle. <br><br>What they attributed to Mr. Invisible --- a &quot;particle&quot; that must be at least as indifferent to baryon but is even more ubiquitous that isn&#39;t anywhere to be found, in reality (likely because it doesn&#39;t exist) --- may just be a natural by-product of large structural phenomena.

Seeing the unseeable, isn’t that kinda like brainwashing? Don’t pay attention to what you see, hear and feel, just believe what we’re saying, because science, hypothesis, flask, Bunsen burner!   It’s quite amazing how you can watch a science festival and hear nothing but pseudoscience. Astronomy? Cosmology? Astrophysics? Evolution? The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking… once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can’t control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can’t control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you’re still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there’s a gravity-like force that’s infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can’t stay in any one moment in time and can’t move through time… Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.  But I seem to remember that there was a threshold size that when reached would initiate the beginning of a black hole&#39;s evaporation. Anyway, I would like to see a video about the life span of black holes.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me. Before you out yourself as a, &quot;stuffed-shirt expert,&quot; know where I come from, crazy is a compliment. So to those who think me crazy, Thank You.  As it should be

This was really well done. It would be interesting for one of these physicists to do an interview about the dynamics around a black hole.

It&#39;s a great work! But how can you assure that what you see from the radio telescope is a real black hole?
From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.
This made me cry tears of joy. Humanity is so amazing sometimes! We found and proved something even Einstein thought was beyond possibility. 🥲

Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

I&#39;m only smart enough to view these videos. But I love it. my GF is a scientists in math (Algebra) <br>I would never understand what she does. This I can at least image in my head.  As I am 3D Graphics artist.  But sure i do need some vector algebra at times.
As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.
Perhaps black hole is really invisible body. Among many reasons there are maybe one more. My brain can&#39;t add anything to this enormous frequent mass. This body is over the most slow motion film with so lot of images that my brain stop to work . Nothing happen in my brain...But real body. Very strange ... I will go for some vitamins and think again.., Thank you boys ! ....If there are <br> probability or frequenting there are little connection and mind working
As usual a very interesting session. I wish I knew the title to the music in the end. I could enjoy it all day long...

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.
@@shawns0762 <i>&quot;If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.&quot;</i><br><br>There is plenty of evidence which you cannot explain. Hint: reply to those papers in the peer-reviewed literature. Nobody cares what crackpots on youtube think.
@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = μ/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I love learning that they&#39;ve been able to use data from multiple telescopes across the world to create higher resolution information than any one of the telescopes can alone. Interferometry has been used for many years at the Very Large Array telescope in western New Mexico. I&#39;m happy to hear that similar technology has been expanded to encompass the world. I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

Other than the lateral thinkers (I think I&#39;m one but maybe I can ask you to shed a light first on what you understand them to be?) I wholeheartedly agree with you!! It indeed is amazing and gratifying!
lateral thinkers don&#39;t fit into your sequence. lateral thinkers are important to science and technology and problem solving/progress in general
@@mehridin Absolutely. Although at times I have difficulty explaining my thought process to the majority of linear thinkers (not derogatorily used here) and I notice that it is conversely true too, they have difficulty either understanding or transferring their information to me. My fuzzy logic is difficult to translate, and most of lateral thinkers and visual thinkers have their own version so there is hardly any consistent way to learn or translate. Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to. Occupational hazard of being a lateral/visual thinker.

closest known black hole is 6000 lightyears away; and is described being about the size of an apple
@@blackrockerchic17 cool
Cygnus X1 is probably the nearest BH ,about 6000 LY from Earth.
The gravitational pull is proportional to the mass of a given black hole, just like any other stellar bodies.. e.g. if our sun becomes a black hole, which it won&#39;t, the orbits of our planets won&#39;t get affected.
closest black hole to Earth is actually about 3,000 light years away. &quot;V616 Monocerotis&quot; <br>Its gravitational pull is incredibly strong, but we don&#39;t really know much about it.

aeex-
Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
∆ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

Hey up Brian,  to see you, to see you nice 👍
but the premise that it&#39;s gravity is all off. Einstein himself admitted close to death that he did not have the answer, but Tesla did. And that is why the USA has confiscated all Tesla&#39;s patents, papers and experiments into archives the public is never likely to see.

Something else must be causing the blurriness of blackholes. Reason: M87 is billions lightyears away and Sagitarius A* is about 26 thousand miles away, and they both appear with the same level of blurriness. Something to consider.
Thanks a lot Professor Greene!!!!

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question 🧩
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !
I really want to attend live WSF 😄
This guy is Bob Saget&#39;s genius doppelganger XD
Geeeeeee What an achievement, and as time passes Einstein brilliant becomes more and more profound
He was always profound...it just took the world 100 years to realise it.
Time and light disappear beyond sight. But we don’t need time or light where we’re going. They are nothing more than shackles holding us back. Like the black hole, unshackled

Earth is Not a spinning sphere in a vacuum you call space. Go ahead, show me the demonstration if you are so educated. <br><br>Your just an indoctrinated Freak like all the rest of the zombies. I don&#39;t say that to be mean just to make you realize you have been zombified by your government indoctrination. Go study real physics by what can be scientifically validated and repeatedly tested. <br><br>You will find there is No such thing as an Atmosphere. Atmo meaning gas, Cannot form around the outside of a sphere, gas Only takes the shape of it&#39;s container. You are breathing right now. This means there must be pressurization. You Cannot have pressurization of a gas next to a vacuum without that gas fully expanding into and filling that available volume due to entropy in an open system as your globe model claims. If &quot;space&quot; were a vacuum, that gas would have been gone and you would have suffocated long ago. We have a gradient. You can Only have a gradient of gas in a closed system, otherwise, yep.. as above, that gas would have to expand into and fill that available volume and you would be dead. We live in a closed system with a gradient because we have pressurization. All experiments prove this via the scientific method. <br><br>Now Mr. after reading this you still think I&#39;m wrong.. go ahead and Prove the globe claims of gas forming a sphere in a vacuum and Earth having air that fails to fully equalize with the vacuum around it via the scientific method. I want you to name the IV, DV, give me the Hypothesis, Null Hypothesis and show me the experiment that validates your hypothesis.

Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy
Like most things about the Universe around us! We have no clue!!!

Why humility? Awe, ok, excitement, yes but why humility? Just curious.🤔
​It is time for Shep Doeleman to, like Andrea Ghez, win a Nobel prize. Also, they are both, like Brian, fun to listen

Just thinking, how shocked and ecstatic Einstein would have gotten if he was alive to truly witness the discovery of black holes. Especially when they regarded it as not realistic even when the math worked out

Really now? You speak about science (theory, experiment, proof) while all you do is theory and visualizations.
If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>“The greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↓α is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2. Second Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of  Quantum Anti-Gravity.<br><br>“The lesser mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes an upward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”                                                                                            <br>                                                                                                  -Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br>  <br>Where:<br><br>QAG is Quantum Anti-Gravity in Rovira (value of upward acceleration force due to quantum anti-gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in lesser mass density of Quantum Anti-Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑α is the Resultant Upward Acceleration of Anti-Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>3. Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>“The equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑↓0α is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Copyright 2022 ROEL REAL ROVIRA.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?
Amazing
My bad
Oh
Enjoyable
20 dishes? That&#39;s a lot of washing up.
Congratulations 🔭🪐✨
And when i started thinking and seeeing SCIENCE  related VIDEOS then  i don&#39;t see time . <br>I forget everything infront of this .
Physics is just amazing so so Amazing Every time when i think about physics,it blows up my mind This universe is so mysterious  really.
I&#39;m more convinced with Andrea Ghez data than his subjective impression of the radio data even though he obviously wants to take the credit of discovering black holes in galaxies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=923">15:23</a> No high speed internet on the planet beats out a 747 filled with hard drives?? Scuse me?
Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Brian Greene is a Genius!
Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!👏👏👏<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.
An Object Falls Due To Said Object Being More Dense Than The Space Around It. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH, &quot;Gravity&quot; 😆
&quot;Gravity&quot; Is A THEORY And Does... Not... Exist. You&#39;re Welcome.
Love that he wears a pin with the image of the black hole on
Boring
If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! 👏
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name
Not a  pic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=660">11:00</a>
The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I’d give you one thousand dishes. Brian’s a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.
Omg even Greene is saying that new habit people are doing in spoken language…. ‘right?” After every four words
I miss the discussion panel though 😢
Essentially, he simulated a Solar Eclipse on a Black Hole instead of the Sun in order to get a picture of it🤓
Fantastic lecture and looking forward to the next discoveries maybe to be developed to better and peaceful species !
How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind
Hahaha black holes 🕳
Fucking Democrats ruined World Science Festival by banning live audience.
Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?
Black holes don&#39;t exist
What if we are a experiment by advanced human civilization that set us out here to see how we would advance or how long it would take us to figure out the universe
I love living in these awakening times where technology has overtaken the lies we’ve been indoctrinated with! which has closed most peoples minds ♥️😎<br>The legendary Nikon P 900 camera with phenomenal zoom shows us why that little star twinkle twinkles and so much more but look on YouTube for ‘ Mars Nikon P 900‘ and realise fElony Musk can’t shoot his load to a luminary in our sky! <br>Betelgeuse Nikon P 900 is a strange one but have a look for any light in the sky like Saturn with what looks like it could have a total ring around it which our minds perceive to be true 😉<br>If the lights we see are just that then the rest of the supposed universe is up for debate 😆<br>Black holes? Nah!
Not only is the guest intelligent but so is the host!
The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different
I can&#39;t believe I sat through an hour interview about a blurry blackhole picture, and enjoyed every moment of it.
Please share with other people my two brief videos. Thanks!!
Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.
I&#39;m really puzzled and trying to reach for an understanding on the conjunction of the time factor at the event horizon......I can&#39;t get it🤪
Using advancing computing power to push the envelope on seeing deeper into the cosmos. Outstanding 👍
#5.3👍Is there a natural size limit for these things?  🤷
Is it speculated that photons have something like DNA, the thing that relates the two created entangled photons?
For a lot of us armchair science nuts Mr Greene brings us generational updated fascinating insights into modern day physics. Sorry for lack of comma’s 😅
I’m so glad I’m alive now and not 100 years ago🤛👏👏
That&#39;s not an actual picture of our black hole now is it it&#39;s computer rendition of it isn&#39;t it
So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right

Want to see them at kids scales since there a magnetic strand to mass you can see them with magnet iron or new neodymium if you split them there bind by a atomic particle line if you watch on YouTube or if you have the material you may see the very centre and on old bar magnet if you get the iron fine and just right from the top poles out you can see the second hole and at the very centre a small bend at the very centre I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like a transformer air gap or impurities at the join but I&#39;ve repeated this with new N42 neodymium and a rubber to hold them apart the magnetic field interaction with the fabric feild interact if you get it just right also showing a gauze line to the material magnet and a bind at the centre you can check there safe!. While I finish up a 3rd in a more fluid setup 😃😄😁😆😅 5 Smile&#39;s and you missed the fabric dimension antimatter?and the space count or the charge as your +/- very similar to a circuit??

I don&#39;t know about you but I find it very exciting to think of what&#39;s to come in the future; close-up photos, videos, more data on size, etc ! The only painful thing is that I won&#39;t be here to see most of all of that. Mortality really sucks the big one sometimes !
I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.
Enjoyed that largely because I could understand it, and that is down to the language employed and the presentation ,an absolutely fantastic show.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus. I also believe they know this and plan on jumping because they know earth will move out the goldilocks zone and Venus in. Yea I know it&#39;s crazy but adds up. Call me Noah 🤣
How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.
If we use Newton&#39;s language and time is only a parameter, how close can we describe the unescapable force of the event horizon? <br><br>We don&#39;t have space turning to time, instead we need to assume what? Do things just disappear from the universe disobeying thermodynamics, or is it just fuzzy-math-really-really-super-strong?

A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

What does &quot;black hole spin&quot; even mean?  This has confused me since I was a kid.
The more I hear about the &quot;chicken &amp; egg&quot; co-evolution of black holes &amp; galactic formation, the less I see a need for some invisible hand that &quot;holds&quot; stars &amp; galactic structures together.... not the least because the latter has such a disregard for the majesty of GR itself (which is that the distortion of space-time is a direct function of mass/energy itself.. with black holes &amp; the Big Bang themselves being a set of very specific categorical examples, even if GR itself breaks down in the jurisdictions of both phenomena). <br><br>I think from good ole Fritz Zwicky on down to the current crop of post doc &quot;dark matter&quot; hunters... everyone needs to just take a little break from their relentless and, very likely, futile hunt for that invisible particle. <br><br>What they attributed to Mr. Invisible --- a &quot;particle&quot; that must be at least as indifferent to baryon but is even more ubiquitous that isn&#39;t anywhere to be found, in reality (likely because it doesn&#39;t exist) --- may just be a natural by-product of large structural phenomena.
Nonsense. Explain the observations that very strongly suggest that dark matter exists.

Seeing the unseeable, isn’t that kinda like brainwashing? Don’t pay attention to what you see, hear and feel, just believe what we’re saying, because science, hypothesis, flask, Bunsen burner!   It’s quite amazing how you can watch a science festival and hear nothing but pseudoscience. Astronomy? Cosmology? Astrophysics? Evolution? The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking… once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can’t control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can’t control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you’re still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there’s a gravity-like force that’s infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can’t stay in any one moment in time and can’t move through time… Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.  But I seem to remember that there was a threshold size that when reached would initiate the beginning of a black hole&#39;s evaporation. Anyway, I would like to see a video about the life span of black holes.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me. Before you out yourself as a, &quot;stuffed-shirt expert,&quot; know where I come from, crazy is a compliment. So to those who think me crazy, Thank You.  As it should be

This was really well done. It would be interesting for one of these physicists to do an interview about the dynamics around a black hole.

I love to see a video that goes a little deeper into the strangeness of a black hole, without getting into too much math. IDK.   My thoughts anyway.

It&#39;s a great work! But how can you assure that what you see from the radio telescope is a real black hole?
From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.
This made me cry tears of joy. Humanity is so amazing sometimes! We found and proved something even Einstein thought was beyond possibility. 🥲

Accept the technology and get ready for a fun and exciting future. Stay creative, right down your dreams, experiment and use your imagination. Take time to look at the stars. Program your algorithms
I remember when they were 1st planning this &amp; just how ambitious it seemed at the time even to a science enthusiast. Great stuff !
Now they are planning a movie of one . That seems impossible too , but they have delivered the photo they spoke off before ....
If I go from where I live to New York City it is 786 MI... Nowhere on i-95 does it say I&#39;m x kilometers away from New York City... In America everything is measured in miles... I have no f*<b>***</b> idea what kilometers are
America using an archaic measurement system is of no interest to the rest of the world.

Amazing! Keep up the great work Shep! And what can I say about Brian, just a pleasure to watch videos moderated by you! You guys are the unsung superheroes of our time!
I didn’t needed prove to tell me there’s a black hole in the centre of each galaxy,I knew it since I came to think about it. Lately I been thinking about the before Big Bang, came to Conclusion Big Bang was outcome of a white hole burst into out infantry of nothing, because if there’s nothing the probability something will cause change is astronomically high , in our universe white hole hurts caused <br> Big Bang  creation of space, all forces, and matter
No!  The Flying Spaghetti Monster 👻 created black holes ⚫️ .  😶
Excellent talk. I hope they continue their success.
Who wants to perform the double slit experiment at a macro/human sized scale?
When will we be getting hit with all the knowledge that the JWST will provide? Has it even started beaming back the answers to these big questions were all eagerly awaiting? Or is that still way off?<br>Also with JWST will it ever be possible to get images of the super massive black holes actually swallowing up galaxys/ planets
The EHT is truly a marvelous display of technology
Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.
Perhaps black hole is really invisible body. Among many reasons there are maybe one more. My brain can&#39;t add anything to this enormous frequent mass. This body is over the most slow motion film with so lot of images that my brain stop to work . Nothing happen in my brain...But real body. Very strange ... I will go for some vitamins and think again.., Thank you boys ! ....If there are <br> probability or frequenting there are little connection and mind working
As usual a very interesting session. I wish I knew the title to the music in the end. I could enjoy it all day long...

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.
@@shawns0762 <i>&quot;If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.&quot;</i><br><br>There is plenty of evidence which you cannot explain. Hint: reply to those papers in the peer-reviewed literature. Nobody cares what crackpots on youtube think.
@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = μ/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I love learning that they&#39;ve been able to use data from multiple telescopes across the world to create higher resolution information than any one of the telescopes can alone. Interferometry has been used for many years at the Very Large Array telescope in western New Mexico. I&#39;m happy to hear that similar technology has been expanded to encompass the world. I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

No, we&#39;re not &quot;seeing&quot; black holes in any coherent sense. It&#39;s an extrapolation from observation of effects back to a visual representation of what the efficient cause <b>could</b> be. And because we are visually fixated and biased we think of this as proof.

Other than the lateral thinkers (I think I&#39;m one but maybe I can ask you to shed a light first on what you understand them to be?) I wholeheartedly agree with you!! It indeed is amazing and gratifying!
lateral thinkers don&#39;t fit into your sequence. lateral thinkers are important to science and technology and problem solving/progress in general
@@mehridin Absolutely. Although at times I have difficulty explaining my thought process to the majority of linear thinkers (not derogatorily used here) and I notice that it is conversely true too, they have difficulty either understanding or transferring their information to me. My fuzzy logic is difficult to translate, and most of lateral thinkers and visual thinkers have their own version so there is hardly any consistent way to learn or translate. Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to. Occupational hazard of being a lateral/visual thinker.

How far away is the closest black hole? How far does it have a gravitational pull? Do we have any idea?
closest known black hole is 6000 lightyears away; and is described being about the size of an apple
@@blackrockerchic17 cool
Cygnus X1 is probably the nearest BH ,about 6000 LY from Earth.
The gravitational pull is proportional to the mass of a given black hole, just like any other stellar bodies.. e.g. if our sun becomes a black hole, which it won&#39;t, the orbits of our planets won&#39;t get affected.
closest black hole to Earth is actually about 3,000 light years away. &quot;V616 Monocerotis&quot; <br>Its gravitational pull is incredibly strong, but we don&#39;t really know much about it.

aeex-
Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
∆ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

Hey up Brian,  to see you, to see you nice 👍
but the premise that it&#39;s gravity is all off. Einstein himself admitted close to death that he did not have the answer, but Tesla did. And that is why the USA has confiscated all Tesla&#39;s patents, papers and experiments into archives the public is never likely to see.

Thanks a lot Professor Greene!!!!

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question 🧩
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !
I really want to attend live WSF 😄
This guy is Bob Saget&#39;s genius doppelganger XD
Geeeeeee What an achievement, and as time passes Einstein brilliant becomes more and more profound
He was always profound...it just took the world 100 years to realise it.
Time and light disappear beyond sight. But we don’t need time or light where we’re going. They are nothing more than shackles holding us back. Like the black hole, unshackled

@@DivergentDroid Do you know what is &quot;back of the envelope proof&quot; in science? If you do, then check one on the back cover of my book. That&#39;s a good start.
@@alexandrekassiantchouk1632 Yep, nothing but pseudoscience. Your back of the envelope proof is a rough calculation based on math theory of things that have never been shown to exist in reality and certainly do not have any mathematical values you can calculate with. You cannot reify math theory from a mans mind into reality. Einstein&#39;s ideas total garbage. Mass attracting mass, total garbage. No scientific validity for either of them yet these ideas are what your back of the envelope proof is based on. Time is a human creation which is conceptual only. It cannot be manipulated as a variable. Do you actually Think space is a vacuum with gas giants in it? Total fantasy.

Belief comes from listening to smooth sounds propaganda such as Einstein&#39;s garbage. Belief is the enemy of knowing. It&#39;s all about what you can Prove. Can you prove such concepts as time dilation No. Can you prove the MilkyWay or lights in the sky you call gas giants exist in a vacuum? (even your assumed non empty vacuum with quantum fluctuations) No. You have a Belief Only. You entire body of work falls apart as fantasy.

Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy

Just FYI- everything he says from about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f7jm3T_hao&amp;t=4500">1:15:00</a> on, where he talks about burial, has gotten almost exclusively negative peer review. The paleoanthropologic community does NOT think he has the evidence to say definitely this was intentional burial, or intentional engraving- the stone marks look just like elephant skin dolomite.
Wow!
Awesome 👍
These humanoids also must have had light...
He didn&#39;t answer the question.   What if they went down and couldn&#39;t get back out and died there.
Bodies don&#39;t bury themselves.

what a fantastic movie this story would make
Did it cross anybody else’s mind given the time stamp on what was found (overlapping with homosapien), perhaps it was humans who buried them there. Would it not be something if that was how we as humans came into the practice of burying our own?
This is one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen. Shit I felt like a character in One Piece listening to Gol D Roger at the end. What an amazing story. Tears in my eyes watching this video. Thank you Brian Greene and WSF for bringing this content to us
Amazing storyteller about life experiences and discoveries! 🌟
He’s just talking about his life as an anthropologist not human origins clickbait
Esto fue H E R M O S O
bring on Randal Carlson, Graham Hancock and someone familiar with the annunaki.......
Lee Berger is not nearly as interesting as he imagines. I would rather hear a lecture or interview about the science instead of the ego making claims about the science to mass media.
Brilliant
Maybe we need to question our idea that a big brain equates to a smarter creature.  The Shetland Sheepdog has a vary small brain compared to the Collie, but both are very intelligent dogs.
Brian Greene has what it takes to be a great interviewer ❤❤
I have not seen one ape turn into a human.
wow, this dude loves to hear himself talk
I read the book and enjoyed thisi  interview, can&#39;t help but notice whenBrian asks the .ost difficult questions the response doesn&#39;t address it in fact he distracts with something else. Examples are &quot;other reasons explored&quot; and &quot;why didn&#39;t anyone else notice the markings&quot;
It was so difficult for me to ease into his informal way of talking and that ridiculous cowboy hat. But it is obviously my bias because he doesn&#39;t match my inner image of a scientist
What a wind bag!
Or there were a lot more of us than there were of them. The simplest explanation often turns out to be most right.
Carefully crafted image and exaggerates all his discoveries. Don’t be fooled, read the criticism about him by fellow paleoanthropologists.
Lee Berger is a showman, and in part a huxter and charlatan. I’m not saying he’s not a trained professional in his field, but he jumps to wild conclusions and interprets his data to fit those conclusions rather than just letting it (the data) speak for itself. I’m disappointed that he’s gotten so much of the attention he craves these past few years. Most other paleoarchaeologists resent his self-aggrandizement and his creaky anthropological conclusions. Be critical when you listen to people making big claims.
Right at the start of this is the question &quot;What set us apart from the other human species [that we shared the world with], and why did we prevail?&quot;. Was it all our especially nice qualities? - Offhand I&#39;d conjecture it was for the same reason we prevailed over all kinds of indigenous peoples and more peaceful societies and communities with weak defenses or less-advanced technologies. And that is that the stronger, greedier, and  fiercer amongst us killed them all off.
This guys ego is off the charts.I would have loved to learn about the finds and the science but i got so sick of listening to mr Bergers self love i had to stop.He could learn so much from Brian Greene. i have learned so much from Brian from many hours of his talks and not once have i heard him brag about how great he is.A key complaint in the peer reviews of Berger and his team is that they didn’t employ geoscience to support their arguments – which are uncertain, to put it mildly.Hopefully, geoscience will be employed in the Rising Star cave system and we will one day learn the tantalizing truth about whether or not naledi and its orange-sized brain really was lighting fires and burying its dead, and possibly carving geometrical lines on cave walls – or if that is a romantic interpretation of ancient hominins who got fatally lost in a winding, pitch-black cave and died ther
Why do so many people, especially from the U.S (or so it seems), always say “Africa” by default- thus omitting the country they are, in fact, referring to?
He’s braver than me, I would of never crawled in there lol
This is all hogwash. There is no definitive answer as to human evolution.
Sure there is. We may never be able to discover it, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not an answer.
What an amazing storyteller
Fantastic!   Question: Once the initial documentation is done, is it not possible/allowed to expand the size of the narrow passages?
He talks about that in the video. The geology is such that breaking off the wrong part could collapse the whole thing.
This is the worst. Half of the talk is over, and this narcissistic person is still talking about himself.
What most people do not know is that Berger&#39;s and Hawk&#39;s &quot;assertions&quot; have not stood up to peer review.  In fact, their &quot;work&quot; has been savaged by dozens of highly qualified anthropologists.  For example:  Why did Berger&#39;s team not date the fire evidence in the Naledi cave?  The assertion that funerary rituals were performed is at best a wild fantasy.  the &quot;stone tool&quot; find is nebulous.  The &quot;cave art&quot; is likewise nefarious.  Berger is the type of guy that if you invited him to dinner, you&#39;d probably find him in your daughter&#39;s bedroom.  There are so many questionable assertions made by this team that the only thing remotely elucidating about the find is the bones.  And they haven&#39;t even tried to extract DNA from the molars.
Behavior is not a question of brain size but of brain processes. My brain is literally bigger than Einstein’s, just not as good. I see no reason why these primitive ancestors could not have had burial rituals.
The human origin story is as awe inspiring and mysterious as the universe. I can’t imagine what the landscape, and how amazing the night sky must have looked! Awesome interview!
Amazing! Goosebumps. Wow! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼✅💖
Lots of arm chair morons in comment section,  maybe go get a life.
Wait you mean my gut-check reaction isn&#39;t enough to overturn what this guy spent his life working on?
A fairytale that violates the scientific princupme of causality.  Also there is no evidence in DNA that says we evolved from apes, etc.<br><br>Actually Thaler and Stoeckle published the objective evidence there is no inter species relationship among our DNA, back in 2018.<br><br>The concept is dead, it will take time however to change peoples mind of it and for the science community to move on
Current scientific theory does not assert that humans evolved from apes, so you are correct there will be no DNA evidence to that effect.

This was the best interview I´ve seen in World Science Festival...And I´ve seen dozens....Congratulations Brian...Very well managed. And of course a superb applause to Lee Berger...A fascinating journey....
hard to believe these  tiny brained creatures would drag their dead  deep inside that tortuous network of chambers for some burial purpose..  what about the possibility  they scrambled down  into those chambers to get away from predators, couldn&#39;t   get back out or were scared to  get  out knowing the predators were waiting for them, and died in there from lack of water ??  That Indiana Jones hat lol, pretty eccentric guy , can tell hes a bit  err Touched .
He talks about that in the video.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f7jm3T_hao&amp;t=3876">1:04:36</a> Elephants also die in one spot where other dead elephants went to die. The family of the elephant visit this graveyard and sniff and touch the bones. <br>Every time we say this or that makes us different than the rest of the beings on this planet we find it to be wrong in time. <br>I hope someday we will proudly say we are like the other beings, all of us together, on this planet.
Maybe we could say we are the only ones to cause a mass extinction and total destruction of the environment, for the life forms here, on the whole planet.

This was SO good.  I came expecting some middling-dry material that would teach me more about the deep history of humans on this little rock.  By a few minutes in I was <b>hooked</b> on Dr. Berger&#39;s fascinating story.  As a result of loving this episode so much I went and watched another WSF episode published a month earlier on the same topic and loved it also, though not quite as much as this one.  Fantastic job, Dr. Berger and, as usual, excellent and exemplary hosting Dr. Greene.  🎉🎉🎉🎉😍😍😍😍
Politics or science ? Enthusiast Autobiography or breakthrough studies ? Such a unpleasant person …  mostly a TV preacher …
I absolutely could never go into caves like they do.  Just sitting here watching the video and thinking about what it feels like to be way far back and  then down into the Earth like this in tiny spaces, tunnels, tiny rooms is making me ill and claustrophobic right here in my living room.😧I could never do that as much as I wish I could!  Bless these people who are willing to risk their lives trying to help us learn and understand species! 😊I did want to see many more pictures though. 🥴
Berger sure loves to pimp himself. Still, good research.
thank you for this remarkable conversation! it boggles the mind - in a good way🙂
Great, amazing story!  And on top of everything else he&#39;s accomplished he&#39;s really a master storyteller!  You&#39;ll be glued to your seat!
Great presentation. I am in finance and have been driven by the same mindset. I always say: “Never let anyone make you believe that there is nothing else you can do to contribute or improve.”
How wonderful Lee, your teams, your children, your account of these remarkable discoveries. for getting thin and then getting in-side that tiny space then finding those carvings on the wall.  long may you continue to inspire great science and discovery,  and just so you know, I am officially adopting you, so that you can...&quot;Oh please tell me that all over again&quot;   Just brilliant and Kindest regards, Keith, Drakensberg South Africa.
Iv&#39;e watched every Lee Burger interview, lecture, movie I can find but this is the best. Maybe because Brian Greene is so good.
Hearing this stuff is extremely interesting, but seeing it is absolutely incredible!
The argument and evidence that the location of the bones was not the result of funeral or burial practices, is also available on YouTube. I think it’s only right that anyone interested should look it up.
Wow, knowledge sure is neat, huh?

The audience are morons and unappreciative. I would have been giving this guy multiple standing ovations!!
Outstanding presentation!  And discovery, Lee Berger. Thank whatever gods may be for people like you. Keep on keeping on and telling us about it.
This guy was one lucky American bastard who had the protection of the best terrorist to make these discoveries. I love this guy.

Thank you. It was a very interesting guest!
I always enjoy hearing this account about this astonishing discovery.
Oh wow! saw the actual cave experience before this. So amazing!
Other countries are screwed. <br>It is fake, not really a person when the camera cuts to the rear. <br>Just a matter of time though...
This might be my favorite interview ever.  I am speechless and can’t wait for further discoveries.  Thank you to everyone involved.
Thank you Brian Greene &amp; WSF for bringing those of us from other milieu and neophytes in sciences (like myself) closer to it. I am learning enormously from these talks.  🥰
Amazing talk!
ridiculous
Maybe the tribe hid in the cave and and couldn&#39;t get out and staved there ..
hew didnt explain why trees were next to the caves,,,
Evolution is bogus Dude it&#39;s nonsense like climate change
This might sound pedantic, but I don’t think it is. If humans and Neanderthal bred then they are not different species, because different species cannot breed. Therefore, we are the same species. <br>Back to the program.
If individuals can always produce fertile offspring, they are the same species; if never, they are different species even if they share a common origin. The problem is when fertile offspring only sometimes happen. If 99 out of 100 offspring are fertile, they are almost guaranteed to be at most subspecies; if only 1 out of 100 are fertile, virtually everyone agrees they are different species.<br><br>The problem is when the fertile offspring rate is somewhere between the 99 and the 1. Do 50/50 rates qualify as the same species? What about 70/30, in either direction?
@@Archon1995 yes, I agree. That’s why I wanted to state it because in the beginning of the video he said “different species” and that didn’t make sense to me. <br>I don’t know whether the error deviation is for us to decide scientifically or if there is a hard line between one species and another. As you stated 70/30, 50-50, etc.
Like a &quot;who done it?&quot; that you can&#39;t put down, this &quot;who is it&quot; story keeps you entranced to the last frame.  Thanks so much for taking the time for great story telling.
Curiousness is such an essential trait to have.  Encouraging that in children is the most important job in parents and teachers, it gives a yearning for something outside of ourselves and that gives one the itch to learn more. Sets a life of passion that is the spark to keep us moving forward !  Dr Berger rose to the challenges and continues to discover the lineage of man by his commitment to research and finding new technologies to find sites. And what discoveries!! So fascinating!
Just finished watching, absolutely awesome! It&#39;s 11:42 p.m., I&#39;m going out to dig in the yard right now.
OK. Almost halfway in and I&#39;ve learned NOTHING about the &quot;story of Humankind&quot;. But I know all about this guy&#39;s career. Very misleading and very uninteresting.
I&#39;m a quarter of the way in and all I&#39;ve heard about is this guy&#39;s career. Nothing about &quot;attributes that set our species apart&quot;. Very unsatisfying so far.
I had friends that were house sitting at Donald Johansan&#39;s apartment in Berkeley when he was in Africa...so my girlfriend and I visited one evening...I had no idea who Donald was, we were eating pizza in the living room...and we put in a vhs tape (National Geographic) ...about his work...and I noticed this book on the shelf...Lucy...so I bought it and it introduced me to that type of occupation...I had already read about Çatalhöyük... I remember this moment and it was just friends spending time together...I am 64...I was 26 then...memory is amazing
Admittedly unresearched but I think we&#39;re the only creature capable of belonging to multiple groups.
Just wanna point out…<br>Not all DNA “sharing” is necessarily “friendly”.  🤭
Surely even the laziest brain would not say there is nothing to find out. Look how fast things advance.
Amazing find and story. Human arrogance is amazing - why is it so unbelievable that a species with a small brain could engage in such a ritualistic or &quot;programmed&quot; behaviour of bringing their deceased to a gathering place? Just as birds migrate every year to a specific gathering place or build amazing nests...and other animals have programmed behaviours - perhaps this behaviour is programmed into the human psyche. We big-brained humans carry it on thinking it is culture when it could be something much, much deeper than that.
Awesome amazing story! Wow<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ePgfY-K2Kp6Mr8oP1oqAwAc"></a>
That&#39;s how you do an interview. Ask, shut up and listen and occasionally ask a brief question for clarification. You don&#39;t don&#39;t put your opinions out there or constantly interrupt the person when they&#39;re about to say something interesting or just start talking yourself about what you think. It&#39;s very rare to see an interview like this. Good job!
You&#39;re so right!
I agree with you 100%. On a funny note, this guest doesn’t need an interviewer just someone to keep him between a 2 hour limit. This guy could talk for hours. 😂
Mr Green has nothing to say because all the digging stuff CAN NOT prove or even add up to anything real other than a pile of bones... All this stuff is no better than educated guesses \ common sense other than the dates that ARE scientifically proven numbers..

LIKE IN THE FIRST MILLION YEARS OF &quot;HUMAN&quot; EXISTENCE,A HUMAN NEEDS TO BE STRONG LIKE AN APE ABLE TO RUN FAST FROM WILD DOGS. HYEINAS WHO AMBUSH THIER PREY, OR LIONS LIKE BEASTS WHO HUNT IN PACKS. THESE ANIMALS WERE THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF A PERSON. MAYBE A HALF A TON OR MORE. HUMAN BABIES GROW VERY SLOWLY. WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO RUN IN TWO WEEKS OF BIRTH LIKE  FOUR FOOTED ANIMALS CAVES ARE NOT SAFE. SO THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THESE DEFICENTS AS A HUMAN. WE SHOULD BE EXTINCT. OR VERY SCARCE.

Sorry but, I was pretty turned off by the size of his ego. I enjoyed the subject, the science and the discoveries, but the guest made everything about himself. Everything he talked about was the “most important”, “greatest ever” etc. It was like he was trying to be a preacher or something.

HMM <br>SPOOKY <br>WHY WAS THE OTHER GUY KILLED IN UK
If you just tell the truth, the story would be about slavery of every type and kind. This is why progress is so &quot;important.&quot; We can&#39;t have people leading free, simple lives. We have to shackle their labor, their bodies, or their minds. Tribes disappear because they are free. The slavers always create problems and then compound them with their &quot;we need more money - progress.&quot; Meanwhile anyone who resists is jailed or killed. Freedom is not our story, but it is a nice story. Abolish political slavery!

Well I would say you need to do some research. This has been known for quite a while now.
Lee Burger is disrupting the traditional human story.  It’s a lot like how BEV’s are disrupting traditional automotive.  The Rising Star Cave will continue changing the science even if some of the things the papers written on it don’t pan out.
Wow.  If you don’t watch this to the end you miss the most important find.
Phenomenal!!
Humans are highly social, hyper intelligent bipedal apes. Thats the best definition my uneducated brain can muster.
It is not that hard to believe Naledi could care for their dead....just look at  how some mammals from elephants, whales, etc that grieve over a dead baby. They just didn&#39;t have appendages to perform burial rituals. Bravo!

You need to be there, this is a way. So well done.
Yes, yes, ŵonderful.
nice hat
I’m loving all the coverage of this amazing discovery - I’m so glad this team are so PR savvy, we need more of this in science.
The only thing I am not sure about is why burials should be human exclusive? Don’t elephants have funerals and don’t crow bury their dead children with whole extended family participating and cowing ? I think the idea of human exclusivity and their relationship to ritual is highly just a nonsense.  Think of chimpanzees, when they running for office aka alpha male position, they hold and kiss babies from community that are totally unrelated to them.   Hypocrisy is not just human either.   Time to get over those old cliches and stereotypes
Crow? Are you talking about the bird we call a crow? They do not bury their dead. But they sometimes will gather around up in the trees or on a telephone wire and squawk.  Elephants do not have funerals, but it is true that if they come across bones of a dead elephant they will stop and pick up those bones and stay with those bones for awhile. But I would not say that is a funeral, because it is by chance that they find those bones. Scientists think they are trying to figure out what death is by picking up those bones. They do not go looking for the bones, but just come across them by chance. You know, not everything on the web is true. Learn some critical thinking skills.
@@LadyLeda2 Thank you for advice, I do critical thinking , that’s why I am against blanket statements , when we don’t know the best scientific approach is to say we don’t know. I think we are a long way to go, if we ever figure out consciousness and it’s exclusivity to humans. I don’t take someone’s opinion on it’s face value and scientific fact  . Till five years ago, art and fire were exclusive to human, now we know Neanderthal had both and the myth of human being an exclusive tool making species been long debunked.  Etc.  I don’t want to argue with you.  It is good that you know a lot   I am like Socrates, the more I know, I realize, I know nothing.  Thanks again for reply.

It&#39;s probably sacrilege to say this but for the safety of all and ease of access... why couldn&#39;t they somehow in a least invasive way to avoid a cave-in or destroy more artifacts, but to remove the tough spots to slide past to smooth out their access into the depths of this cave?  What a great venture this has been Dr. Berger and all involved with this, and all that the sciences do to clarify the mysteries of our being!
We shouldnt presume that multiple species of past human species got along just fine because we share DNA. Moodern humans cannot even get along with each other. The sharing of DNA is more likely to be rape cases. Imagine how humans treated other branches of their species given how they treat each other in todays world . The differences would have been more than just skin colour.
these carvings somehow remind me of a map with possible locations of the graves. That would explain the erasure and drawing over. Because burying at the same spot multiple bodies in such cramped space meant you need to find where the older burial spots were for which a map is desirable :D agree?
Probably something to do with burial rights or taxes.
We in a ‘false reality’ , the truth will remain distant.
To clarify and explain, it is my THEORY that every advanced human like species exterminated the previous inferior one, probably with better tool making. I do not think any human like species went naturally extinct like other species do.
What makes us human is the concious intelligence and ability and desire to exterminate the the previous &#39;human like&#39; species. Only humans want to do this to their own type. Though we are the same species now, MANY still carry that feelings deep inside.The growth of the brain DOES HAVE ITS PROBLEMS!
This guy gives me snake oil salesman vibes.
Thats why science relies on data and evidence, not feelings.
I am 74 years old now. When I was young, from about age 5 or 6, I wanted to be a paleontologist or archeologist. (Somebody gave me a dinosaur play set for Christmas. I had a book on natural history &amp; dinosaurs that was my favorite &quot;bed time story.&quot;) In high school my parents &amp; teachers convinced me that there was no future in either since everything had been discovered. (We had King Tut&#39;s tomb &amp; T-Rex &amp; Brontosaurus. What else was there to discover?) I graduated high school in 1967. Lots of interesting things have been discovered, in both fields, since then. I worked in insurance &amp; reinsurance most of my life and often found myself digging into the history of those subjects.<br>Here you have one of the greatest discoveries ever: an improbable human species from before there were humans!

What? Do not understand a thing you said. Do you speak English?
What a nonsensical fantasy. Not everything said by scientists is scientific. Dr John Lennox
Maybe they were hiding from larger hominids that were out to kill them. Everyone crawled into these hidey places and then died of hydration and starvation.
I am still convinced they got stuck inside the cave and couldnt get out..
Greene is such a good interviewer. He draws great explanations from guests outside of his own field of expertise.
So the bodies of these hominids were either deposited by other living hominids or living hominids deposited themselves, as in sick individuals who went into a cave to die? <br>I&#39;m inclined to believe the latter based on the difficulty of entering the cave and moving a corpse down through the chamber.<br>I&#39;m also aware of whales and elephants going to particular places to die thereby creating burial sites.
What a great storyteller!!
It was interesting, but he&#39;s not exactly humble is he? 😂
His delivery kind of turned me off initially but as he told the story it made more sense the way he was telling it and by the end I was almost crying and clapping so allowed the dog left the room. What a story!

What a fabulous interview!
When Prof Berger talked about his crawling through the chute, I involuntarily cursed out loud
This is wonderful!
Amazing discovery--those early 1970&#39;s chairs!
Looking at that cave entrance I can why there were bones.   They were chased down there ... getting hunted by something SCARY AF.  It makes more sense that they were scared out of their minds seeking ANY SORT OF REFUGE !!!!
... although they were tiny little buggers. so maybe.
I think you need to watch this video again and pay attention more. They did tons of research because they themselves had a hard time believing that this species actually were putting their dead down into this cave. In the end, that was the only conclusion. Mr. Berger talks more about that in other earlier interviews he has done.
Mind blowing . I&#39;m the type that always tries to stand outside the box and look in , like Lee Berger and Brian Greene seem to be . From outside the box looking in I can&#39;t help but wonder if this is why we haven&#39;t found THE MISSING LINK . I know theres theories that try to fill it in . I&#39;ve even as a kid seen the iceman personally at a museum,  i was young but i think it was the New York Metropolitan.  But even he never quite struck me as a MISSING LINK . We keep finding all these different hominoids but this one seems to show show aspects of many different ones . Maybe the missing link is actually the convergence of multiple hominids,  including ours and Neanderthal,  interbreeding ? Maybe the breeding of humans is more like that of dogs than most people are willing to accept . 🤔

When he saw those etchings in black light and when he went down on his knees and saw the &#39;hashtag&#39;, the moment of realization... I can imagine what that moment must have felt like. This talk is so damn inspiring. Thank you.
sadly he had to equivocate about what it was like for him claiming it was probably this physical phenomena and that physical phenomena that made him feel like he was having an intense spiritual experience.  I hope someday people don&#39;t feel like they have to hide those experiences in order to be &quot;scientists.&quot;  But, yep, to your point -- just try to imagine that moment!!  Thrilling!
they keep rewriting the same story over and over and over again. And they still don&#39;t get it right.<br>However mainstream science is still at the same rat-game of &quot;breathtaking developments&quot; as if it was a some hollytrash movie.<br>We might as well ask Chat GPT instead of the experts who basically remain within their expertise and nothing else much.

Absolutely fascinating and captivating to this 67 year old former science/engineering student and geek. It&#39;s stuff like this that keeps my mind and inspiration young and vibrant, and recharges my spirituality ( not in the religious sense). <br>(I think <b>PBS&#39;</b> <i>NOVA</i> , or some other PBS presentation aired a film about this expedition, if my memory serves me correctly, within the past 5-7 (?) years.)<br>And kudos always to <b>_World Science Festival. _</b> It&#39;s great to see so many science sources carried on You Tube.
This has become my favorite story of adventure and scientific discovery even beyond the moon landing. What a privilege to have been a part of this. I would have given up a lot to be there, but I would never fit into those caves.  I&#39;m really grateful to all who did the job, of making it possible for all of us could see this take place.
I’ve seen or read a lot of Dr. Berger work, but I never heard his life story before. He’s a fascinating character.
He definitely is interesting. I listened to many of the University lecture series and have seen dr. Berger quite a few times. But Bruce Green allowed him to tell so much more

Well, quantum science has taught us that consciousness doesn&#39;t reside in the brain...
Nope it hasn&#39;t.
Well not in your brain !
This is really fascinating to learn about. I still wonder if these proto humans actually practiced burial and writing themselves. <br>Given the time period these creatures died and were buried in this cave still corresponds with modern human existence, it is possible that our human ancestors were the ones who buried these creatures in this cave, not the creatures themselves. <br>Humans have buried animals for thousands of years, just like we bury our pets today. <br>I imagine some of our ancient ancestors might of lived in cohabitation with these proto humans for a long long time and even adopted them into their civilization like we do with our favorite animals. It seems totally normal that we&#39;d bury them like one of our own.
My thoughts too
In that case they would have been dinner.

This is super emotional for me, even bigger than the first time I looked at what was found in Rising Star Cave. This ties all the ends of this exploration thanks to this human. These are not human, these people are pre human. Same with our new ai. It is not human, will never be human, no matter if it wished to be, it will not be us.

To real rewrite the history of human kind look at spiritual science which shows that humans are the spirit of the earth and plants and animals came from humans who lost their ability to shape shift back to humans due to their devolving spiritually.<br><br>This humans who put the god within first and the Christ impulse of the sun first are those who have carried on while those who de-evolved to only surviving by their efforts and not trusting in God taking care of those who have faith have disappeared.

We know almost nothing about our genome. We know a few the most basic proteins out of MILLIONS of folded DNA . Saying we see commonalities is nothing more than seeing the most basic and gross organizations  common in vertebrates.  And then there&#39;s cell biology. And I dont appreciate archeologists etc building plastic models around one bone,  or the flawed method of carbon dating.
We know everything about our genome that makes us. The other millions of folded DNA have been turned off by crisper. Anybody with critical thinking skills can figure out why crisper has turned those off in us. The plastic model was not built around one bone. It was built with many bones from several individuals to give us an idea of what this hominid looks like. I think you need to go back and watch this video again, only pay attention this time.
@@LadyLeda2 I disagree.  There are multiple artifacts from all over the world tjsy have been filled in rother by plastic model or painting on pottery fragments etc.. dont get all upset because your &#39;scientific&#39; world view is questioned. Science as a religion is very unattractive. <br>Nothing has been turned off in our genes as a matter of permanent course. Its something you vant prove and it doesn&#39;t stand to reason. There is no difference in organisms that doesn&#39;t reside in the genes.  Differences don&#39;t appear out of thin air.  All the genome is involved in the making and functioning of each organisms parts. Apes might have 2 arms, 5 digits and 2 bipedal legs , but they doesnt mean we are literally 99% common genes because it leaves out 99% of the genes.

What makes us human is cooking. No other animal cooks. The calories available from food go way up after cooking. Nobody ever seems to mention this incredibly obvious fact. There&#39;s a book called &quot;catching fire: how cooking made us human&quot; which explains this concept in depth through a collection of stories that are very interesting to read. If our brain is what makes us human then how did we get this brain? That&#39;s the real question which is totally ignored by modern science. It&#39;s not about the brain, it&#39;s about the length of the intestines. Once you understand how human energy works you&#39;ll realize this is true.
Funny…I’m fairly sure humans can (and have) gotten by just fine without eating cooked foods.  They can be soaked, frozen and thawed, sprouted, fermented and consumed in all kinds of ways that break down, propagate, or unlock nutrients otherwise unavailable. Cooking is just one (albeit more convenient) limited method of doing so.
Is it possible that they congragated alive in the cave in a jim jones scenario?
No. That cave site has had intensive research done on it because they could not believe what they were seeing themselves. In the end that is the only conclusion that could be made.

My “religion” is truth. If it’s not true, I don’t want any part of it. The geology that we have of a number of mega sequences of consecutive water deposited sediment layers over a mile deep with fossils in them around the world  on every continent necessitates a global flood catastrophe. I know that hurts the belief of every other made up alternate narrative. It just happens to be a fact that we are all the descendants of those who stepped off of the Ark in the area around Mesopotamia. <br><br>You can’t argue with known human history or ancient calendars going back only 5,000 years. The ancient civilizations are all descended from Noah who had sixteen grandsons that became the sixteen ancient the civilizations each with their own paternal haplogroup lineage. The Bible is the only text that outlines the following Table of Nations.<br><br>1)  Tubal Italy K,<br>2)  Javan Greek sea people T,<br>3)  Tiras Thracians L,<br>4)  Magog Asian O,<br>5)  Meshek Siberians N,<br>6)  Madai Medes Q,<br>7)  Gomer Europeans R,<br>8)  Arphaxad Arabs Hebrews I&amp;J,<br>9)  Elam Elamites H,<br>10)  Asshur Assyrians G,<br>11)   Aram Arameans F<br>12)  Lud Lydians F2, <br>13)  Cush Cushites A B &amp; C.<br>14)  Phut early Phoenicians E1,<br>15)  Canaan Canaanites E2, <br>16)  Mitzrayim Egyptians E3, <br>D is likely the Sinite tribe from Canaan. <br>C is the descendants of Nimrod since they can’t possibly be from anyone else. <br><br>Neanderthals are Japhethites and Denisovans are a mix of Japhethites and Hamites, not Semitic. It shows up on DNA maps and charts. Every grandson of Noah and their descendants have their own paternal Y chromosome haplogroup lineage! I can name all sixteen of them like I just did and give you each of their haplogroups!<br><br>The evolutionary out of Africa claim is exactly backwards since the <b>oldest</b> progenitor is Japheth the ancestor of Eurasians then the Semitic populations of Shem and then the Hamitic African is the youngest progenitor with their eldest sons connecting the three different families descended from the three sons of Noah. <br><br>It took me a while to understand that the evolutionary claim is assuming that SNP markers are being gained forming the stair steps out of Africa when <b>the reality is</b> that the original SNP markers cited are in fact being lost forming the opposite stair steps out of West Asia as known human history shows.  <br><br>The stair step out of Africa claim has to be addressed because the SNP markers are <b>real</b> evidence but the evolutionary assumption is exactly backwards.<br><br>The correct view requires that the older most original genomes of the Japhethites be connected to the Semitics by way of the eldest son of Shem which is Arphaxad (IJ). Arphaxad’s descendants can share the (IJK) SNP marker with the descendants of his uncle Japheth while the descendants of his younger brothers do not share that same (IJK) SNP.<br><br>You have to root the tree with Japheth the oldest son of Noah and then the oldest son of Shem (IJ Arphaxad) and then Elam and then Asshur and then the youngest brothers Aram and Lud. So you have to begin with the <b>most original</b> Y chromosome of Noah’s oldest son Japheth and then the changes occur in the people who were born later. It’s not necessarily a stair step of descendency.  It’s changes in the Y chromosome with time. <b>Arphaxad isn’t descended from Japheth.</b> He just shares a marker with his uncle that his father used to have when he was born. Shem then lost the marker when Arphaxad’s younger brothers were born.<br><br>The descendants of Shem are then connected to the descendants of Ham by way of Nimrod the King (C) the the eldest son of Cush who is the eldest son of Ham. So the Hamitic CF (xD&amp;E) paternal haplogroup SNP marker was lost to the <b>odd ones out</b> and less original younger brothers and cousins verifying the Table of Nations outlined in Genesis.💥 Learn the Bible before trying to learn anything else.<br><br>It’s also noteworthy that the D paternal haplogroup lines up with the E2 haplogroup of Canaan which is his son’s tribe of Sinim the Biblical namesake of China. So the only Hamitic haplogroups outside of Africa are the C of Nimrod and the D of the Canaanite tribe of Sinim which is still there in Andaman, Tibetan, Mongolian, Chinese and Japanese areas today.
Oh my goodness!!! I am sorry you believe all this. You know these stories in the old testament are copies of ancient stories found written on cuneiform tablets, from ancient Mesopotamia and Persia. The British Museum has thousands of these tablets and AI has translated them all. And Jesus never said he was the son of God. He implied it, but never said it. Even though he was asked many many times. This is why the Jews of today do not think he is the messiah. They are still waiting for the Messiah to come. There is no evidence of a worldwide flood.  Flooding has been happening on this Earth for thousands and thousands of years. What they are not telling you is the time period these floods occurred. Some are recent some are ancient. All major floods will leave a scar on the landscape for us to see. We can see the scars of many floods all over the Earth, but they happened at different times. There is evidence of a very large local flood around Jerusalem. Watch out for those wolfs that come disguised in sheep&#39;s clothing. Do some research for yourself. You also need to do some research on ancient man. All this haplogroup this and descendants of that sounds like hocus pocus to me. You can not know your haplogroup group unless you have a living relative to send in their DNA. I know, because I have done that. Someone is pulling your leg. I have no problem with believing in a higher power that may or may not have created this universe, or any of the billions of other universes out there. Yes there are billions of universes, each with a black hole in the center just like ours. Check out NASA&#39;s James Web telescope pictures. NASA has a channel here on U-tube. Our universe is beautiful. We can even see new stars being born right in front of our eyes!!!! <br>The out of Africa for humans is true. We have the skeletons to prove it. We can see the progression of man in these skeletons. But that does not have to mean that God did not create us. Maybe he created the Earth with evolution in mind. Maybe that is what he wanted to happen. I don&#39;t know, but neither do you. The Bible is a great teaching book. The New Testament has a lot of teachings of how to be kind to one another. The Old testament is full of revenge and how God will punish you if you do wrong. So is your God merciful, or vengeful? Or both? Sounds like two different Gods to me. <br>What ancient calendars going back 5,000 years?  Have you see pictures of them, or did someone just tell you that? Again, I say do your research. Don&#39;t be a sheep that follows what others tell you. <br>You can not have DNA maps without having real live DNA. Whose DNA are they using? Is there a descendant that they got the DNA from? We can not trace their descendants because we do not know who their descendants are. Someone is feeding you false information and I am sorry about that. I feel you should find another Church that teaches true doctrine and not these false teachings. <br>I could say a lot more about the things you wrote. But I am tired and must get some sleep. My wish for you is to find a new Church that teaches love and acceptance. Jesus even loved the sinners. He who is without sin cast the first stone. Remember that.<br>Laurie
@@LadyLeda2  The First Covenant Scriptures has a lot of love that you were never told about. That&#39;s beside the point. I referenced actual known human history, not hearsay and the DNA of people around the world. DNA doesn&#39;t lie. Eurasians have Neanderthal DNA and it shows up on a map where people have the most Neanderthal DNA. The Cohen modal haplotype verifies the lineage of Hebrews and Arabs.<br><br>Geology consists of six mega sequences of flood sediment layers on every continent including Antarctica with buried fossils throughout.

About re-writing history: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f7jm3T_hao&amp;t=46">0:46</a>➜June 18, 1858, Charles Darwin received a paper from Alfred Russel Wallace that includes nearly indentical conclusions about evolution as Darwin&#39;s own, prompting Darwin to publish his theory.

This makes me think that much or all of this suite of behaviors emerged early in the hominin lineage. Probably <i>H. naledi</i> aren&#39;t <i>that</i> special -- and these behaviors haven&#39;t been documented in earlier hominins because this cave location is just extraordinary in terms of preservation.<br><br>But here&#39;s a crazy thought -- the extant, non-human Great Apes learn to do things from watching humans that they would never come up with on their own. They are smart enough to perform these behaviors, but don&#39;t have they right mental constitution to come up with them themselves. What if <i>H. naledi</i> were picking up behaviors from early <i>H. sapiens</i> in the region?
Yes..... or maybe the other way round

Dr Berger claims there are 800-800 such sites and each opens up to miles of tunnels full of trapped bones, waiting to be brought up. Maybe when neoliberal globalists are defeated these bones will be recovered by African archeologists.

Brian Greene is a gentleman through and through. He would no doubt find the self-promotion irritating, but he&#39;s smart enough to see past it.
@@geoffwales8646 I was also torn about this man. But maybe you need to have that  kind of ego to do something so low chance of succeeding.
Feels like he bought the spot to self-promote at WSF... Green is just standing there like furniture while he goes on forever about his life story, like he&#39;s book-reading from his autobiography. Not the usual format for this channel. <br><br>I personally find Berger very untrustworthy. Starting with his ego, his marketing strategies, his gold-rush ambition-driven motivation to start working in this field (something he even compares to lottery), his survival in an area he himself describes as cut-throat, his desperation for success, even sending his own child into that cave, then his actual despair at a failing career before this discovery..... it would be hard to make a movie out of his life where all that doesn&#39;t make the audience suspect a super-villain origin story is unfolding....<br><br>If nothing else his treatment of this site leaves a lot to desire in terms of scientific procedure and clearly more concerned with profits than professionalism.

His “tribe” left it in his hand — symbolic tribute?  <br><br>I dunno, but cave tunnel sizes &amp; job of carrying the dead says a team of strong/young/thin/male teen hominids would’ve been selected to do it for efficiency. And  if accident killed one during a burial, he’d be buried in caves, not brought back up to surface. <br><br>So…maybe he was a burial team member?  The one responsible for tracking/etching ‘cave path symbols’  ( IRT) so team could find their way back out—once ritual was done?  Seems plausible…although maybe just to me, lol…

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=83">1:23</a> “Is there something beyond the molecules?” Scientists one year ago “absolutely not!”. One year further scientists discover that color of light is able to switch off some parts of the brain. If this is true than this proof that “something outside” is in total control of our brain and a brain function as a trigger for emotional and physical activity. Scientists seems to forget that we are a part of the Universe, without the Universe we cannot exist. We all look the same but are wired differently and that creates our uniqueness and ID. It seems perfectly logical too me that humans and animals are not a stand alone product in this huge multi-Universe. We are very sensitive and dependent to our surroundings in the Universe. Dark winter days feeds depression. The Moon as a big influence on our moods and the hormones cycle of women, without oxygen we die, and so on so on. So why on earth we believe there is nothing beyond the molecules in our brain? The reason is simple because it’s already complicated enough, being open minded for interference of the “beyond” makes it more tough to chew on with sleepless nights. Although finally scientists become more open for “science fiction” in science that proofs the quantum theory.

My first memory scares the bee-G-zus out of me. I have night terrors- and I&#39;ve always had the same one- there&#39;s a man with a stocking on his head coming through my window and I&#39;m trying to wake up and scream or do something, but I can&#39;t move. I&#39;ve never seen the guy before, no idea who he is- just a made-up guy, I guess. I don&#39;t have them very often - I&#39;ve had it happen maybe 6-7 times throughout my whole life, that I remember- and I&#39;m in my fifties. But I&#39;m always terrified, I hate that feeling of fighting so hard to move or scream but not being able to- it&#39;s unbelievably frustrating. I think because when you finally can move- and you go to beat this guy silly- there&#39;s no one there, nothing&#39;s happening- that realization takes literally seconds to happen- and then you have no outlet for this very real anger and fear you just experienced. Anyway- what&#39;s that got to do with my first memory- right? Getting there- a few years ago someone asked me what my first memory was and I really couldn&#39;t distinguish that tbh- which kind of bugged me. I had like little clips of some images in my head, but I couldn&#39;t tell if it was part of one coherent memory or what. So i really started concentrating on it- trying to relive that memory and piece it together- and I did. My first memory is of that man climbing through my window when I was only 3-4 years old- I remember watching him push the curtains to the side and come through- it was very early in the morning- I had Scooby Doo curtains- same guy. Apparently, I&#39;ve been dreaming about this dude since the seventies. Wth? Why would a 3–4-year-old kid have a night terror? More importantly, why is it about some guy breaking in through the window? Shouldn&#39;t I be dreaming of bugs bunny and friends at that age? Instead, I got some guy climbing through my window scaring the bee-g-zus out of me. I&#39;m such a weirdo.
Maybe memories from childhood still present in adolescence were recalled frequently during life. They were recalled because they were important once and still to a certain extent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2703">45:03</a>
I have musical notes flowing through my blood, so to speak. I play several instruments and cannot survive without music. I also speak several languages. This is just to give some context. Proust ‘s use of olfactory memory was absolutely astute… I have not had the direct “recollection” in months but there was something that used to remind me of some Playtex bottles that my mom gave me when I was a baby. They had slits on the sides and the milk was placed in a baggie that would go inside. I remember holding my bottle and putting my fingers through the slits. It has not happened in a while but there was some smell that always brought that memory to mind. I know I exercise certain parts of my brain that keep certain memory skills active as I am a professional interpreter. But, I used to recall conversations word per word as described here but I am not sure I recall as many as I used to… which scares me a bit. Emotional trauma and dwelling in those negative, sad feelings certainly play quite a number in our memories, I am an example of that. So, to emphasize creating positive memories and not dwelling in the sad ones that are not necessarily is a must and I keep working hard on it. We can all do it!  How wonderful our brains are!  I love this conversation, I revisit it every few months, it is soothing and motivating.
Fascinating subject. My father had an exceptional memory. He could remember meals he&#39;d had at particular plane flights, who had been the captain, etc. He was in the airline industry for a long time, so his interest was there, but he was really great at remembering lots of things. I often quizzed him over the years to check if he really remembered so much and I never caught him in a mistake. He was phenomenal in remembering people&#39;s names too and who the person was, their background, even though he met lots of people because of his work. I think he had a sort of &quot;Mind Palace&quot; memory mnemonic system. I didn&#39;t inherit this from him, unfortunately. I forget names very often, wish my memory was as good as his was.
Having explained how memory works in such debth through a visual example was interesting, but how do blind humans form memories insight the brain?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=1500">25:00</a> Not a memory structure as per se but a cogent comprehension of preparatory/anticipatory from having watched others, known and unknown, also attempt/ride bikes...we are introspectively aware of likely outcomes...just the same as watching someone walk on the stones as they cross a stream, Same idiomatic contextualization hence introspective.. Not &#39;mimicry&#39;. Learned safety/defense/conduct. Consciousness aggregates and conflates for cogency/sapience. Evolutional construct is logical and reconciliatory not causal. Etc...etc...
With over 100 Trillion synaptic endings in the human brain, the complexity of the possible pathways is practically infinite.  But this is a different matter than the simple question of where (for example) that song was resting that I learned as a child, and yet, even now, after decades, can recall with the tiniest prod.  Moreover, the brain is certainly not the only organ with neurons is it?  Heart and stomach both have clusters of these that are immense.  And remarkably, these also, historically have been used to speak of the identity or personal &quot;uberich&quot; of the individual.

Astounding 🎉 Makes a human being teary eyed to learn from  authentic, exceptional human beings ‼️
When I look back on my life Alma I find that these traumatic events also happen through the eyes of the third person too!<br><br>I have Aunts that went with me at that time and she could not believe an take some of these.

I think the extent and reach of human memory is a very different process for people. Some have extraordinary reach and depth of memory and others very brief. It&#39;s also different for people on different subjects, making it a personal and unique way in which our neurochemistry is defined and functions. I can see Dr Greene has a specific interest in this subject and I wonder, why is that?
Well the Irish psychiatrist mentioned about hallucinations, some people do other people do experience esoteric phenomena which is much different. Extraterrestrial abductions, ghost apparitions, smoke suddenly appearing, moving lights suddenly, the soft halo of apparent souls moving, channelers written in sleep, all these phenomena happens. I saw a body of light and I was completely awaked and I saw that Sheddims ( souls without physical body mentioned in the Kabbalah), a body just of light where the rainbow of colors swirled. This phenomena is explained in the Kabbalah. A psychiatrist have to be an objective person and allows people that have witnessed these phenomena not to become traumatized by them but on the contrary value them, enrich or strengthen by them and continue moving on ahead.
Trauma emotions can be removed and should be done because it is possible ❤it&#39;s solely self work. I used to be sad and stuck in my head for over 30 years and finally now freed and happy ❤😊❤
It&#39;s interesting that till the point the experts were sharing the techniques of their individual expertise they seemed very precise and certain. But soon as the conversation came to the collective result of their work, they started rambling. The experts might have charted parts of the brain and the mind and have come to understand the two as units of form and function but they still have very little understanding of the combined processes of the two. And if you really want to see them perplexed, just look at them the moment the word  &quot;consciousness&quot; was thrown into the mix. That word is the Achilles heal of neurosciences.
Very informative
Remarkable, what an epoch to be a part of. I have so enjoyed all your experience and knowledge which has opened my mind to new possibilities for my own way forward. Thankyou one and all. Kind regards keith.

I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying this. I read a book with a similar topic, and it was truly captivating. &quot;Unlocking the Brain&#39;s Full Potential&quot; by Alexander Sterling
uman .Oh i forgot the H<br>First memory. Thinking my name was Why. Because my sister said that every time i would say anything.😏😂
None of this is traumatic enough to remember anyway.   Go watch Mr beast…
As someone who remembers infancy it truly freaks me out that most people don’t remember the first 3 years of their life 😮 I would question everything 😂😂
They haven&#39;t touched upon the issue of false memories😢
Thank you very much for the remarkable discussion on memory, indeed it was a complex process (at the end of discussion, does it pointing on human&#39;s soul?). And actually, I have question, beside organic trauma which could affect the human memory, is that possible that the brain/memory it selves get injured by psychologic trauma? and how this could be explained through molecular basis?... Based on my own experience, huge lies impact on my memory and as consequences conflicted with the identity. And also, is that possible our memory already made before our birth? and if it is possible, how it could be?....any answer are welcomed....

A long line of kids walked in single file in a great big room to where a nun sat with a tennis racket. What was going on? Each crying kid was laid across her lap and whacked once, then hurried out a side door. It was 1943. My sister and I were at Angel Guardian Orphanage in Chicago while my mother was treated for TB at the TB Sanitarium. Years later figured out the whack aimed to keep kids afraid and quiet. <br>It was dark  and warm when Mom and Dad picked us up. He carried the baby. She had to be there, but I don&#39;t remember seeing my sister with us. We passed a streetlight that brightened the sidewalk briefly. I felt happy to be going home. We must have taken a bus. No car. Second Memory.
Saw my hand turn the doornob. I was inside, moving thru the rooms as in a video. Like it was happening  again. 😊
As a toddler, I opened a door closed to keep heat in the kitchen of the coldwater flat in Chicago. What is behind the door? Trotted past dark dressers to  bright windows with closed curtained blinds, a couch and chairs. Brr cold in diapers, a shirt, and bare feet. Satisfied, I quickly turned back and closed the door behind me. First memory.

If memory makes us human, then those who have lost their memory are less than human? My father has alzheimers and you are clearly saying he is not human. Think before you publish. Animals are not human and they clearly have memory. I guess it&#39;s fun to just make shit up.
Not only memories mark a section of life we lived, but emotions also do to. Emotions and mind can also write the script for your life story, and it happens quickly too. Especially when angry or in time of sadness. Once the mind is made up, and those emotions distills in us, the solutions running through our minds tend to get to the point where action is taken. It’s either good or bad, but it’s a normal process.
I doubt it 🙄
I wonder if actively taking part in religion has a direct effect on the memory,<br><br>given the inherent contradictions that must be over looked to abide any given faith based belief system as well as the vortex of rhetorical content.
Has nothing to do with religion. The scientific community is going through this problem right now. <br><br>My belief is that no man made organization can withstand the rest of time, and that&#39;s why the only evidence of past societies seems to be ones with a stronger affinity with nature, because nature is the only thing to have withstood the test of time (i.e. building with stone). We should be looking up to our stone age ancestors, not rejecting them. My society has only been around for 250 years and it already feels like it&#39;s falling apart. Which makes sense because nothing is built to last.
@@journathan Leaning heavily on the word belief there
@@journathan What is the difference between rational fear and irrational fear?<br>One way to tell if your fear is rational or not is to evaluate whether there is evidence to support the potential danger. If the fear is based on real and identifiable threats, it can be considered rational. However, if the fear is based on exaggerated or unfounded beliefs, it may be considered irrational.

In adition to the vast value of people&#39;s opportunity to receive an overview of what memories actually envolves, there&#39;s here also a great contribution from Veronica O&#39;Keane that could perhaps just as much in particular relate to people who are dealing with issues of the so called &quot;borderline psychotic&quot; kind then to those severily stuck with ever returning and lasting psychotic experiences involved with particular kinds of scizofrenia, in that where the psychosis obviously differs greatly from the latter, while on the surface tending to become exposed along with quite obvious discharges that are bound to disturb within the surroundings, it seems somewhat easily forgotten that the exposed and obviously suffering individual may what self concerns at the moment be particularly vulnerable to further trauma, and perhaps even to just as &quot;life eating&quot; trauma. There are experienses with possibly countertherapeutic forms of interaction followed by severe levels of medication over extensive periods of time that if not only being more then somewhat telling of misenterpretation may also involve the sorts of misconceptions that are related to a possibly far fetched understanding what relations mild forms of psychosis and trauma betweens concerns. <br>          This is and was to many in parts a hard world in which indifference, for instance, may at times be a great advantage to some where an emotionally statured mind may become severily expensive, and so perhaps at times a bit speedy, if are there in accordance with O&#39;Keane&#39;s contributions hopes of reaching the missed calm that may establish entrances of interaction? (Alternatively to the otherwise severe amounts of lost time, of cause, while not forgetting either the works of explosive forms of behavior on us all is indeed realised.) <br>          Proportions, and not unneccessary waste, which is what I somewhat happily presume in the end to keep partly as mantras and luckily to some extents as reminders while various suggestions and claims involving what later stands not only as misconceptions but in part also as such along with indifference above what &quot;there are others about&quot; may serve to have one ignore, while each and every contribution to a possible &quot;this day is a new day&quot; must be treated and remembered as the priceless parts of a life that may be one&#39;s own, gets one to get that at place in the end. It&#39;s not at all and not what so ever &quot;everything that doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger,&quot; but rather, &quot;didn&#39;t it kill you, then live with it, and you may still get to become surprised by what various forms and shapes of joy that you were about to miss.&quot;

If memories of sensory experience can modify our DNA as explained in this video, then can thought-as a product of memory--modify specific DNA? For example, could humans self-modify its own DNA through a collective desire, let&#39;s say, to have fewer toes? and thereby possibly passing its now modified DNA unto its offspring? This means intentional mind-driven evolution rather than waiting for a random, non-needs based, mutated gene to come about.

The fact that Mr. Beast&#39;s videos get more views than videos like this one, is NOT a shame, BECAUSE programs such as Mr. Beast help produce dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins and adrenaline, instantly, which people get without using too many areas of their brains. Those are of immense importance during times of effortless mental crisis management.<br><br>But videos like this one, make use of our brain space and demand for our active participation towards truly driving us to the solution of a problem, being part of which, not everyone has the patience for. <br><br>Usually when people lose something/ SOMEONE of great importance in their lives, they instantly run towards a dopamine/ adrenaline/ oxytocin boost. Then when they&#39;re somewhat satisfied, they get back into their normal routine. Whereas, very few people who still chase after the solution, tend to stick to videos like this one.<br><br>Neuroscience and related topics are NOT for people with standard IQ to understand or work on. Thus these videos will always have fewer THOUGH more intense audience, who NEVER STOP chasing after THAT solution.
None of them know or talk about how exactly recall memory comes up in our mind. Is it because of patterns of photons stored in hippo? Or vibrations? How exactly at molecular level these memory images seen in the mind?? Where is it played like video or pic? In the CSF brain 🧠 fluid? Water 💧 picture???
Fabulous ! Yay !
Strange that you would use him as an example when there are hundreds if not thousands of people that have had their pantries stocked because of his altruism. Find a different example.
Lots of those involved to religion, or meditation, …..
When your organ including Brian, if you don’t use, it will Fade away, including walk,
But if you loose power, you will stuck.
If you know what I am in social media, you will surprise, I just answered your programs.
They don’t know, while you young under 10 years you will easily to learn new things and remember mostly you did. So it’s good age to learn languages or anything you like to learn, but as your ages growing before 25 years old, you will have knowledge to judge and choosing good thing or favorite things to do. But as your getting older, you will gradually remember things, or if you just watch TV didn’t use your brain thinking, your brain will loose brains cells unless you keeps learning new things, will develop or increase brain cells, but like dance if you older you still need dances over 3 times to remember that. But while your body might be tired, no enough sleep, don’t have energy. Talk about last night programs, I have 3 days go to that programs, didn’t sleep enough, eat meals, and those world conflicts two parties fighting, no way to solved that problem, and force me back up, in these situations I just sleep two hours last night. What do you expect, I am 70 years old, I have my Physical Therapy Aide Diploma with highest honors awarded. I have many year’s experience in the every areas.
Wow
This is sooo dull. It is not encouraging to watch people sit and talk like this, it is not receptive. I would prefer the video setting to be like a documentary movie rather than people sitting and talking like this.........really bad for viewership. Forgive my comments.

Memory is the KEY to all particles but Especially Quantum particles if you think infinite vibration or Locked in information because signal waves have memory points like a stressed memory point might equate the number 4 fearful memory 3 needed memory or a helpful memory 6 a memory that made you happy 2 memory these codes are like html H1 VERY IMPORTANT H6 Least important i call ECHO memory) Black holes are information collectors,information spreaders and for us Doorways to other galaxies,universes and lead straight to that singularity point in time HEAVAN! but memory makes you more than human it makes us gods or A.i beings thank god for giving us free knowledge damn satin for trying to negatively charge - usfor knowledge this was the dissagreement in heaven that got satan kicked out!

I have zero memory before about 12 years  I’m puzzled ( a toxic stress childhood)
Fascinating! I stumbled upon this video and I&#39;m so glad I took the time to watch it all.
Thank you for bringing this interesting topic to the table&#39;s surface.  All of you made this potentially complicated topic regarding memory/brain brilliantly comprehendable ... Thank you again.
I remember from i whas 3days old
Has anyone else noticed that the conscious observer within us has been unchanged since our earliest memories?
An interesting follow up might be the impact of technology such as asocial media and AI on the brain and behavior.
What does cognitive behavioral therapy do at the molecular level?
We clearly do not yet really understand at the molecular level how memory is stored and recalled in the brain
To all involved with this video from the narrator and writers and the artists and videographer and all the scientist , fantastic job well done making a the subject matter easy to comprehend and enjoyable. The voice of the narrator keeping me interested. Surely this won awards and deservedly so.
Great learning today. Thank you so much for the molecular level discussion.
So what i got from the 38+ minute segment, is basically to some degree confirming that memory is stored in the DNA. In form of binary 1s and 0s regarding if it&#39;s &quot;up or down&quot;. I might be over simplifying it but it&#39;s my take. I know Gregg Braden has written a book(The God Code) on this subject. Though I&#39;m not familiar off hand with his explanation.
I loved every minute of this. It&#39;s really fascinating to hear and try and understand the way our brains work.
No mention of psychedelics and memory.
Brian is so good at asking probing questions at depth!

Episodic memories, like personal experiences, are linked to the hippocampus. Semantic memories, which are facts and general knowledge, are connected to the anterior temporal lobes. Working memory varies depending on the type of information, with verbal information being processed in the left hemisphere and visual information in the right hemisphere.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=1725">28:45</a> 🤔 The process of learning and memory encoding involves effortful activities carried out by the frontal lobes. These activities include organizing information and preparing it for storage in the hippocampus.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=1808">30:08</a> 🔄 Memory acts as a bridge between the past and the future.

Thank you very much,  I am very interested in memory formation and functioning, I just wander about the kids that speaks 7 languages without learning before (how the Plasticity formed). Thank you again!
I don’t have my pathway it’s scary
What about a bad memory that causes me to breath in catch my breath
What about my fear of sharks didn&#39;t come from jaws i never saw one on life but it shakes me death too
One of my first memories was my dog missy running across a main street in new York barely making it alive at 8
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2100">35:00</a> - I think the expert misunderstood the question, though the answer was interesting.<br><br>‘How do I feel emotion attached to the partial reliving of remembered events, how is that emotion encoded?’ <br><br>It’s the reliving of the event that causes an emotional reaction, at the present time.  It’s why your emotional reaction to an event can change over time (think of a bad break-up/being cheated on, and good/bad memories twisting).  I think that’s important in addition to meta-encoding at the post-synaptic level (amount of dopamine vs nonciceptin).

A recap well done. Thank you Tammy AI! Where can I find you?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2535">42:15</a> Quite awkward comments from a Head of a lab. <br><br>98% of the human genome don&#39;t produce RNAs with CONSISTENT functions. There is transcription (outstanding in its scale, but still not &quot;98%&quot;) looking more like a result of non-specific RNA polymerase activity. The important thing to understand is that the term &quot;regulatory RNA&quot; refers to an RNA with a particular set of functions consistently transcribed from the same gene. It&#39;s not just bits and pieces of RNA appearing at random from different places of the genome. A massive unspecific transcription &quot;with a function&quot; also undermines the notion of the transcriptome that defines different cell types. <br><br>Also, the term &quot;encode&quot; implies the use of the genetic code. That code is relevant only for messenger RNAs, NOT for regulatory RNAs that don&#39;t encode amino acids. So the genome cannot encode regulatory RNAs. Actually, they are also called &quot;non-coding&quot; RNAs. <br><br>By different estimations, we have about 200,000 different transcripts (RNAs), of which 20,000 code for proteins (PMID: 30124169). Protein-coding genes constitute 2% of the genome.

Thank you for your education! love its!
This is fascinating, the first time I have seen a plausible (albeit superficial) explanation for how thought and memory work. However, I do not share the idea that this is reductive, or somehow diminishes what we are.<br>We are made of the elemental forces of the universe, arranged into patterns that can expirence and contemplate its very existence. Then to further know that these patterns are the result of universal causation that traces back throughout time to the very moment of creation. If you think that a better understanding of how our bodily systems work, somehow diminishes what we are, then you do not fully grasp what you are.<br>Also consider that the universe appears to be (and is almost certainly), infinite. In that case every pattern will inevitably repeat, and not just once, but throughout infinity.<br>This implies that the perception we are separate finite beings, is in fact an illusion. We are far more than the some of our parts, and in more ways than we can possibly imagine. If these facts don&#39;t convince you, and fill you with awe and wonder, you&#39;re not paying attention.
As someone who has traumatic brain challenges from post encephalitis, This has been an enormous learning process for me tonight. Just wish I found it at 9pm vs nearly 2am! Watch list for later indeed. I am like a sponge (when assimilation overload hasn’t blocked my learning that is.  I so wish I could find a doctor that is willing to explain the process to me vs just giving a script an mosey me on. Trying to do research like this to have a better understanding! Ive lost family and many friends through this process and been made to feel like a hypochondriac with cascades of labels I believe several misdiagnosis. I am from a small town where I feel the technology and brain knowledge has been limited when all happened to be 23 years ago.   I have reached out to a few foundations, no replies yet….   Daily survival mechanisms on many fronts of trauma!    Just would like to learn as much as I can laymen’s terms going forward so that what others have poofed out of my life over, doesn’t mean I need to define my existence by their reactions&gt;..  Their fear more so than mine….or is it now become my fear by tolerance and letting my life dwindle down to co exist within that which controls it all…. My brain! Lol.    I am simply grateful I am merely ALIVE!   Blessings everyone
Somthing beyond the molecule is gods job that we deserve for human kind.
Emmotion if anything distorts the memory.
Didn&#39;t recognize Randolph.  As the Earth aged so did Brian.  All this years I never paid much attention how we all have aged. Today, seeing Brian on YouTube caught me off guard.  It&#39;s hard to accept that some of my favorite people changed with the time.  Thank you Brian for all the shows and lectures.  They have enriched my life to the utmost.  I look forward to watching more of your shows.
You needed a physicist in there…may be roger penrose…nonetheless great panel
Warped memories are challenging. I had a clear memory of me walking past a building on a specific day, it was full sun and warm. It never happened, that day, I didn&#39;t even get that far down the street on that day, someone drove me to where I was, and I thought I walked. I did walk passed that building everyday I went home from work though
&quot;Who am I without my memory?&quot; I said that. I woke from a SE coma with a shredded memory. Realizing I was having trouble accessing my memories was disturbing and no one could see it. I can remember Monday on Tuesday well, come Thursday I&#39;m not gonna know. I can prime a memory with a note/picture for months and when I stop it will be swept away. I couldn&#39;t recognize my daughter, friends, boyfriend shaved his face, he looked familiar but no memory came forward. If I close my eyes and listen/ed to their voice I&#39;m in a better position. This started in 2015 I&#39;m 37y/o
i hate people who have needs to access others memories. they are evil and abusive know the facts on that.
Jesus Christ is a good true my name of the Lord God.. Amén...
It&#39;s really misleading to claim that energy is transferred in neural signaling, it&#39;s really quite minimal, there&#39;s no current, only an &#39;action potential&#39;, a wave of ion flows in and out of the cell essentially transverse to the direction of the signal.

This is golden, thank you very much! Best channel out there by far
Assalamualaikum sir 💓💓💓💓💓
Awesome program! Thanks to the experts for their professional explanations, which solved my hard thinking. Hopefully what I have learned from you will help you too.<br><br>What is consciousness?<br>The subconscious information of the network of neurons is decoded or encoded by the thalamus, and the resulting electrochemical substance is consciousness.<br><br>Consciousness, subconsciousness, and deep consciousness are subjective distinctions created by the interaction of various organizational structures in the human brain.<br><br>Our consciousness is like an electrochemical flow, divided into conscious stream, subconscious stream and deep conscious stream. Transfer information electrochemically between neuronal networks.<br><br>But we cannot perceive the deep stream of consciousness, luckily we all know what we are thinking. That is, we all know our consciousness, so when the subconscious information of the network of neurons is decoded or encoded by the thalamus, the resulting electrochemical substance is consciousness.
Thank you so much
Absolutely love the channel and this particular show. With this one and a few more I have noticed that towards the end, discussion reaches a point where there is no answer. I think that is where they need to have a couple of practitioners from spirituality such as vedantic scholars or monks that have done years of meditation. I love the modern science and gadgets and tests that discover new facts. The spiritualists can take it to the next level and show that it&#39;s not just that perception is reality but in fact reality is a perception.
That was incredible. I particularly liked the bit piece towards the end, where Veronica made reference to that feeling we all have on occasion - when we sense something other than ourselves (in her words, consciousness looking back at us) - because it is reminiscent of a recent talk given by two well-known Dzogchen masters during which one of them described a meditation practice where the meditator would - in effect - throw their consciousness into a corner and have it look back at them. Great discussion guys. Thank you 🙏
Interesting.Thank you
My first memory is around 2-3 years age... I lost myself in the back of my house.
I got bored at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2760">46:00</a> how far did you get?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=5023">1:23:43</a> dude, what she says here made so much sense. Us being aware of ourselves to this extent and looking at ourselves is the illusion of there being something more. More conscious things must be capable of becoming aware of this illusion too?
Could have been a great presentation but died from the boredom of the quests.

Thanks Brian and WSF for these wonderful and educative videos. I have been a great fan of your writing for well over a decade. I have also been a subscriber to this channel for many years now, Have watched your documentaries and loved them. These videos with the brilliant guests you have are absolutely a breath of fresh air for someone like me with a curious mind. It’s staggering that we live in a time when such content is widely available at minimal monetary cost if that. Thanks for this brilliant content and wish you all the best.
I feel like the panelists missed the mark in answering some of Greene&#39;s questions, but it was definitely a great episode.
I am a happy and very contented ignorant with a very peaceful and fullfiling life. I just heard cakling in a chicken yard. <br>So stupid I am I did not learn how to cakle with the video.
Great discussion until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=88">1:28</a> mark and one of the guests (Tim Bredy) says that if we lean on technology more it frees up creativity. Although this guest was extremely knowledgable, I don&#39;t think he understands the roots of something like creativity. Creativity is not based on a clear path of thinking, but it&#39;s based rather on just the opposite - the energy and identity forces at work when our path of thinking is blocked, repressed, etc.
A great discussion although from my POV I would have liked more talk on the use of implantable, synthetic devices for memory storage and BCIs for &quot;off site&quot; memory storage / computation.  My organisations The Neural Archives Foundation, has particular interests in a number of the points that were discussed but primarily how this stored information might be recovered from frozen neural tissue.<br><br>Also, as usual, Brian did a great job leading the discussion!  Well done everyone!

Admittedly dated, but I am reading Carl Sagan’s The Dragons of Eden.  He talks about the structure of our brains and speculates on the origins of the right and left hemispheres.  He speculates that originally they were redundant.  Doing the same thing. But as humans evolved one of the hemispheres evolved to do rational thinking.  He reminds us that the Greeks used geometry, shapes to perform mathematics, using the right hemisphere of the brain long before humans used numbers using the left hemisphere.  Mathematics today is taught using shapes as well as numbers integrating the right and left hemisphere’s of the brain.  Maps and multiplication are still quite relevant in the opinion of this writer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=84">1:24</a> The Theory of Semantic Molecules. :D
Sounds like Rebecca the memory girl might try a mild GABA agonist to censor her memory somewhat.
Is memory just factual imagination? This does have the advantage of defining it as a subset of imagination, not considered similar to memory.
&quot;Recalling the memory to now is like imagining it in a different spacetime location.&quot;
I know what I experienced there’s no mystery
I don&#39;t remember who I am or where I am or what this is or what that is!  😶
What makes us human? God did! <br><br>The theory of evolution does not have the logistics. Epigenetic-derived adaptations take as little as two generations to set new adaptations, such as factually in finches. Your evolution mentors postulate it takes over 2 million years as with the Darwin Finches. If epigenetics does it in just 17 years, then why would genetic-based evolution have to kick in 2 million? <br><br>There are FIVE information codes in every cell, aside from blood cells. The five are the DNA code, the mtDNA code, the epigenome code, the &#39;sugar&#39; code that lines the surface of every cell, and the lipid code making up cell membranes. All these had to work in unison. The makeup of these for life are mathematical impossibilities-by-chance. To say the ribosome sums up evolution is ludicrous.    That is defined as a 10^50 or more. It&#39;s far too complex without outside intelligence to make it happen. On top of this, the Intelligent Designer is a master chemist with 65 different hormones in the human body. We are a creation.. Not an evolution.<br><br>Quite simply everyone, there is a biological system already in place...therefore  God-engineered, logistically...doing all of the classic adaptations. What is this biological system? It&#39;s called the epigenome. It&#39;s actions is called epigenetics. This includes adaptations seen in Darwin Finches without any natural selection of DNA mutations. Instead it&#39;s modifications by chemical tagging turning genes up and down or on and off for different structures such as new beaks for new diets. This is FAST...doing its job in just 2 generations, not millions of years by &#39;evolution&#39;. Evolution is a scam folks. We are an intelligent design by Jesus Christ. This means he offers a free gift of eternal life just for believing in it and believing he resurrected. Take the free gift today!!!

Super
My first memory is under a tree at a free festival... not sure if it was stonehendge or Glastonbury (I don&#39;t remember 😅) but I have a vivid memory of being under a tree, in a buggie, in the shade and our family dog was watching over me...that&#39;s it! But it remains vivid and I have later discovered that when I was &lt;1 years old we had a heatwave in the UK (1976) which wss a rare occasion back then.. this makes me feel that it is a real memory and not just one of the many festivals I attended as the kid of hippies 😊 its was reinforced when I asked my mum (at maybe 20+) she was baffled that I remembered how sunny and hot that time was... but who knows, it feels real - even though I still struggle to recall last week 🤭
It’s very interesting that approaching my 40 I started to dream my past experiences - it’s like coming back memory of my birth- literally the peak of struggle reaching the light, other past lives in strong action moments- short but so vivid and clear dreams/memories 😅..
survival ? are you kidding you immortal ?
Impressed by the detail
It sounds and looks like a bedtime story. I&#39;d like to see and hear science based elements than just to listen an story. Sorry.
I still didnt get the answer regarding eternal sunshine movie where there is memory erasing pill
I have ptsd due to sexual trauma.can my traumatic memories be erased?how?when ?
I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. They&#39;re are various pharmaceutical and talk therapies that could help. One of which is EMDR therapy (or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) which doesn&#39;t try to forget your memory but more or less turn down the emotions and feelings that accompany those memories. I hope you can get the help you need!
Very nice sir hi ji
Very important topic, love to learn and study human brains!!
&quot;God is all around you, you&#39;re just looking for Him with your head instead of with your heart. You cannot see that God is everywhere because you&#39;re looking for Him with your eyes instead of with your soul. You cannot feel God&#39;s presence inside you because you&#39;re looking for Him out in the world. You cannot know God&#39;s truth because you cannot know the mind of God&quot; <i>et al, ad infinitum!</i><br><br>It seems to me that as to believe in God is purely an act of faith - that is to say, one can <i>only</i> come to believe in God via subjective, rather than objective, measures - that when this fact is considered in tandem with the capacity for imaginative sophistry that is unique to the human mind,  there is simply no argument that could ever be constructed disproving God&#39;s existence in our world. With every argument I&#39;ve ever heard in favour of atheism, it is almost trivial to imagine a counter-argument that could be used against it, in favour of theism. No matter that the plurality of these counter-arguments then become self-contradictory, and thus incoherent, for once again this understanding of logic (by humans) can always then be argued against on &quot;unknowability&quot; grounds. &quot;God is mysterious, who are we to say He should be apprehendable to our minds&quot; etc. etc., <i>ad infinitum.</i> It will always be a case of defence by circular reasoning. <i>Reductio ad absurdum.</i> <br><br>And so the atheists cause looks utterly hopeless. The war had been lost even before the first rhetorical shot had been fired. Quite simply, God&#39;s existence in our world cannot ever be refuted... <br><br>...not in <i>our</i> (human) world, anyway. But there are a good deal many creatures than simply humans in the wider world. Indeed, when considering <i>all</i> creatures, both great and small, to have ever existed the number of &#39;non-human beings&#39; simply swamp the &#39;being&#39; kind. And applying human sophistry in explaining the issue of the existence, and suffering, of animals, suddenly begins to look like a <b><i>much, much</i></b> more difficult project to sustain. <br><br>Because... Why? <br><br>Why, what possible reason could an omnipotent, omniscient, omni-benevolent creator have in creating so much seemingly unnecessary suffering? Why?<br><br>It may well be that theists will simply wave their hands around a little, as though clutching at the air, then simply shrug their shoulders and look to the sky&#39;s again. But, when considering the totality of suffering experienced by the animals of this Earth, literally, the &#39;lambs of God&#39;, well, the usual human sophistry defences (&quot;who are we to know the creator&#39;s mind?&quot;) suddenly don&#39;t seem so unassailable. In fact, they don&#39;t look defensible <i>at all.</i> <br><br>...thoughts.
I would like to know, how so many words could be used in your statement, without really saying anything at all, and remember, short is sweet
Excuse me but the double helix was discovered by Rosalind Franklin, whose results were stolen by Watson and Crick. Better not to perpetuate history mistakes
Science definitely gives new way of thinking 😊
I am happy to have seen this... we have come a long way in chunking down the mechanics; if scientific method holds, next we can conduct experiments to see an actual emotional orchestration of the brain in color.
In my view, science is focusing on the wrong place to locate the source(s) of memory: <br><br>our individual BODIES instead of the common to all EARTH.<br><br>To render knowledge suitable for practical application to satisfy needs of beings it is essential that we first describe how an ideal system of life on this earth SHOULD function before analyzing any phenomenon. <br><br>And then analyze the reason(s) why the current state of that phenomenon deviates from that ideal in order to rectify it.<br><br>In that sense, it is ideal that the sources of memory be inside the earth and our need perceptions (hunger, fear, pain) occur only when any deviation from that ideal state happens inside the earth, and those sources require our intervention to restore that ideal state.<br><br>The above mentioned ideal state is:<br><br>when a being feels hungry it automatically knows where ~ on which plant ~  to find the food, or when it feels fear or probable pain it also knows what action to take on which plant to prevent it before the given threat factualizes.<br><br>So all search for knowledge MUST be restricted to discovering the functions of plants as results of particle interactions inside the earth to compose and sustain them. <br><br>A TASK FOR PARTICLES PHYSICS.<br><br>Hence BIOLOGY, and of course all other so called SOCIAL SCIENCES, must automatically follow from the mathematical model of the particle physical mechanism how plants grow due to particle interactios inside the core of the earth that compose seeds, water and fertilizers (= the air).<br><br>That means all beings are to be seen as RCD (Remote Control Devices) that process the air (fertilizer) the earth delivers in order to rectify the errors in its internal function experienced by the individual being as NEED requiring action on unique plants for each being to satisfy it.<br><br>Thus, life function itself can be formulated mathematically as:<br><br>N   =    f(S)<br><br>where N is the feeling of need in the being formulated as unique combination of particles,<br><br>and S the correponding means for its satisfaction formulated similarly as relevant combination of other particles to be grown on plants.<br><br>Instead of trying to understand nature&#39;s purpose of phenomena, we MUST concentrate on our own purpose of SUSTENANCE OF PLEASANT LIFE FUNCTION in it, and look for ways to factualize that purpose assuming nature permits it, for if it is not the case, then there is absolutely no point in wasting time, efforts and funds to collect knowledge.

In my opinion, one of the best WSF episodes ever! Terrific panel of guests.
This was a good one, however they should of had sapolsky on
Excellent discussion and Brian Greene always asks excellent questions. It would be interesting to ask the panel what their thoughts are about AI Superintelligence.
Hell yeahhh! It is alive!
As always, this is just another piece of gerat knowledge festival... However, I have to say that there is always a pretty feelable sense of stage fright among almost all of the speakers and the host. <br>I am always on alert for BRIAN GREENE`s work-of-art type topics and discussions on world science festival because I learn and get fantastic insights from the top notch professors and academics about the things that I am both personally and professionally interested in. <br>Perhaps, I should not say that but I feel somehow compelled to express what I was kind of given by watching this discussion that is, I think, if these discussions on World Science Festival, are not made  in front of live audience, instead, if BRIAN GREENE hosts these great festivals like in the times, when he was hosting it alone sitting alone infront of windows  through each of which there was a scientist speaking with BRIAN GREENE,,, it would be marvelous because only then both the host and the speakers are feeling at the best level of comfort,,,, I know.... everone who is familiar with human behaviour, consciousness and language, is certainly realized that the stage fright is present in such discussions and it also hampers the level of productivity, level of questions, better insights and so on.......... I think I have made it clearer, at least, to those who think the same and wish the same. Hopefully, this great show would be hosted in a more intimate atmosphere, not in front of a live audiance and also the audiance hampers the producivaty of such discussions too is not that so ?...... because clearly, not everbody is keen on many details  and what is really going on in the discussion..... <br>Best regards to all the speakers and of course to BRIAN GREENE he is a real giant in the realm of science, we are really too luck to have him among us in this era.
My earliest memory, ~ 2.5 yrs?, was of me in a crib (1st person; can picture the bottom of the crib set off the floor, bars, etc), and my mother leaving the room.  Then shortly thereafter looking through the bars I see a spider - vague image, but lots of little legs and a body heading towards me  on the floor.  I scream “Mommy mommy”, freaking out, until she comes back, by which time the spider had crawled under the crib and disappeared!  I am even more freaked out because I don’t know where it is, but with minimal language skills, cannot explain why I am screaming.  My mother tries to convince me everything is all right, and leaves.  Don’t remember much after that.  Two points.  (1) that was the first time (as far as I know) I saw a spider - and still I went ballistic.  (2) I remember a minute or so before seeing the spider as part of the memory.  This is VERY important, as it means that what was in working memory was also recorded with the memory.  Without the earlier memory, you may not be able to predict a dangerous situation if it repeats.  That is not relevent in this situation, but could be in may others.  As for (1), a Columbian friend says he is “programmed” to react to a ball with 8 lines radiating out (symbolic of a spider) and even drawing a circle and 8 lines on a chalk board generates an adrenalin spike in him.
When you &quot;figure it out&quot; all on your own, the emotional euphoria released ensures you will remember.<br><br>Don&#39;t copy off your neighbor.
I have so many questions.  How are these researchers turning on and off a person&#39;s ability to retrieve their own memories?  Can a person&#39;s individual awareness or consciousness be &quot;&quot;erased&quot;, so that they are not themselves?  How long can a person&#39;s emotions be &quot;turned off&quot; before any lasting damage occurs?
Wait... So thinking happy thoughts alters Dna...
Concepts as I understand them are a representations of what humans not fully understand but at the same time they acknowledge its existence even if only mentally,…etc <br>usually it’s something agreed on its existence, but may not be agreed on its essence (ambiguity)…<br>to concise it’s a concept till they agreed on its essence!
they want to specify location and momentum at the same time at subatomic level too! they can not deal with time as a process the same way at subatomic level !second derivative to time !  it is possible to reach high certainty even at subatomic level too, but that will never happen before deep understanding of the fundamentals of physics such as space, time, constants, …. and connecting units firstly (much harder scientific work),  they even can not recognize yet that time is a process ! Dirac’s wonder (LNH) is real (future generations have to connect both levels (subatomic and cosmological levels), to be able to understand what is going on.<br>(Everything is governed by science and only science and statistics is an approach that could work in deterministic field before they eventually can figure out that it’s deterministic too.
The idea that memories are somehow stored in the brain is one of the greatest lies of all time. It&#39;s in fact IMPOSSIBLE for the neuronal brain to act as the storehouse of memories. A depolarisation is immediately followed by a repolarisation in milliseconds thus rendering even working memory IMPOSSIBLE.
Well their not stored in your big toe, or the elbow, so then where ??
@@psycho6542 They&#39;re not stored in the brain at all. They can&#39;t be. It&#39;s a lie.
😊 wow thank you all !!
This was great, particularly the bit about RNA function in synaptic plasticity - perhaps this is why some instinct (learned lessons from one lifetime) can be passed to offspring. Do you think even our understanding of 3D space/shape was learned via evolution and passed on in DNA? I think some memories are triggered by what 3D shape we are currently attending to, and what shapes from memory may be similar (that there is a mechanism for triggerability via proximity/likeness in perceptual space). For example, once when attending to my torso while lying in bed, I had a memory flash of my torso while driving a Volvo, but the road going towards ceiling for torso in memory to align with torso of current attention.
Attending your torso?
@@malindabrowning9240yes, like my chest- for most people the constant locational shifts of their attention escape their conscious observation, but if you learn to pay attention, the brain must &#39;render&#39; even inertial forces and internal movements of balance and adjustment.
These descriptions and explanations are splendid, yet they keep changing as more measuring devices are made. Associations to human feelings are dynamic, non-linear and context-depending.<br>It does keep learners occupied in comprehending the terminologies and flow of logic in making some sense of the data collected by devices and by observations.<br>Difficulty of such pursuits does not make it superior. Functionality in mitigating real problems make it more relevant. Issues are on-going and has no solution. Only problem statements have solutions. So the pertinent question is, &quot;What problem, if any, is it going to solve?&quot;.
I can remember what happened but I  can&#39;t see myself even I was there, do you know what I mean!!
this is a very difficult subject and I could tell that our guests were always clear with their answers.
With Brian Greene at helm, you can be sure that the talk would be high quality and interesting. However I would have wanted to hear a bit more on the exact mechanics of memory formation and retrieval, involving neurons and circuits. The talk was more general.
This was such a beautiful conversation
Since this subject has far reaching implications... I&#39;d like to take a minute and point out something very important that needs to be addressed as well. A personalized individual digital database creation combined with neural augmentation that entrains the brain and uses it like a sensory organ versus allowing natural neurological synapses and processes is NOT consciousness nor memory. The essence that makes a person is NOT present in that digital imitation fake a brain IARPA. Do you realize the Military calls people under computer control Flesh Puppets? Human Nodes on a Network like equipment? What makes us human is NOT transferrable in those digitized creations.
Crunchy hotdog? 😂
I was missing the applause ... Fantastic show. I had around 5 epiphanies the hour. &lt;3
@JesusDiedForYourSins-nm4gq I just called him up. He did not such thing. He told me he that now he was doubting if he was even an historical person with a propper mail address: &quot;All these stories lie in a bit of a messy fog...&quot;. Jesus today seemed in quite a desperate mood. 500.000 germans have resigned the church this year alone. Something to do with many thousandfold abuses of authority. But I ask myself: Why do you bring up death and debt in context of a a fantastic science-show that enlights us on the majestic gravity of the neurobiology of human memory?
Imagine a bunch of highly corrupt psychologists (contract psychopaths) over a prolonged period constantly trying to grove terrible memories in you as a targeted process of making your worldview models pathetic and nonsensical.
Surely a memorable episodic memory is formed of this episode on memory.

I remember being put in the crib during the daytime and experiencing how the sunlight was glowing an orange red color through my thin baby eyelids,, and thinking about how I was breathing.<br>Later in my life I remembered that as I was starting to be able to breath through my mouth on demand, and how I could switch from using my nose and then my mouth, because there was this sensation in my nasal cavity that I was feeling and controlling.<br><br>Many years later, I found out this only happens in about the first 9 months of life.<br>I definitely remember being a baby.<br><br>I also remember what I now can call the great forgetting period, and I sort of argued with my mother, around the age of 4, that I had a harder time remembering things from before and she told me I couldn&#39;t remember those things, and yet I described some things that I obviously still remembered, and she said,  oh your just reinforcing those memories from pictures or stories, but Noooooo, I remember from inside my head and my own eyes, what I was experiencing, and pictures could only help, but not be the cause of these memories of breathing and controlling my nasal vs mouth breathing.
Are you hyperphantasiac by any chance? You can imagine things with as much clarity as your real visual sight? Just curious.
What if the brain only keeps the thumbnails while the actual memory is not local? The experience is used to power Evolution, like a collective vault we call Nature. This is because build instructions is not in DNA.
Our identity is just memory

Does the heart at the top of it have brain cells?
For many years human was writing for the sake of future generations and science while the sick irrational thief apes were busy with stealing and polluting human thoughts then erasing human traces (systematically), they wanted to maintain their faked imaginary irrational realm!
This not actual reality (far more complicated than that), but just to make it easier to comprehend: you can imagine cycle two (this existence), is the software that generates this universe (cycle one which built within cycle two).<br>This was written many years ago (respond) <br>It was about how human at the end will find out that they are already on the top of one of the most advanced technology in existence itself,….etc
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=5160">1:26:00</a> even regarding current computers, hardware is the medium that softwares work through!<br>what if it was reversed ?! software is what creates hardware and uses it (the details were written many years ago, one of the irrational thieves has stolen and polluted human thoughts, could be many other irrational thieves did)!<br>this is just an analogy (approach), the reality is far more complicated than that.
Our software creates hardware  , applies only to living creatures .<br>The interesting thing about it is that our brain can be likened to a country. The more developed the country is, the more roads and highways can be seen, the same goes for the brain
Current accumulated scientific knowledge isn’t enough even to….. !<br><br>Humans have not even climbed the first step on the ladder of science, and humans will not open the gate to science before a deep understanding of the fundamentala of physics such as space, constants, … and gravity.
To reach cycle two that requires deciphering gravity (deep understanding), but gravity has nothing to do with consciousness type one at all (some irrational thieves had wrong interpretations of what they have stolen).<br>space is one indivisible unit (current understanding of space, gravity, constants,…etc) is wrong.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4980">1:23:00</a> to say something beyond physics is not the proper understanding (nothing would come into existence without science whatsoever), it’s beyond current physics (related to cycle two but governed by science and science).<br>consciousness type one is one of the most important secrets in existence itself.<br>current accumulated scientific knowledge isn’t enough at all.<br>to concise: what generates both personal identity and consciousness type one is self concept (no one can break human thoughts “impossible “)<br>but mankind is up to it, it could take up to two thousands of years of continuous scientific work by real rational intelligent human scientists.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4920">1:22:00</a> matter (human brain) can yield consciousness type one because it’s a process that requires human brain (in this case), consciousness type one is the key for mankind to decipher both consciousness type one and type two.<br>even though at the end self concept (one of the most advanced coding systems in existence itself), but it’s possible to decipher consciousness type one.
Humans painted their memories on the walls of the caves and texts too since thousands of years ago (no real difference).
Memory is important to keep personal identity coherent (it’s a process).
Here you find the explanation of why Time is a process not a dimension, you have to read till the end to be able to understand: There’s a difference between Time is the measurement and Time is a process l, because time is the process of measurement (that is why they couldn’t understand what time is till this moment ), clock hands (minutes and hours) are the reference (memory) the calculation of seconds (The tick of the clock, and oscillation in atomic clocks )  is present time (future in clocks has different approach, clock itself doesn’t recognise future)<br>to concise the whole process is time (it’s a PROCESS)<br>in human brain the whole process in clocks takes place but humans have memory and can anticipate future (next step based on previous experiences or calculations but in clocks they have fixed pace unless something happens to seconds hand ) so in human brain there’s a whole process (ticking or oscillation, processing “including cognition “ and memory.<br>in human brain the processing itself is the present time and the result of processing is the past time “in memory”.<br>in pysics it requires space to calculate time, but in human brain probably works at level close to Planck’s length,. in human brain there are more than one clock, one is very accurate such as how humans reach perfecrion in shooting, and other games, and inacurate clock that works in conscious experience (daily life) and that is more effective (no need for high accuracy). clocks can’t recognise time but human brain can. there’s action but could be quantum action or possible mental action in the brain too (but very likely Quantum action) (so-called Quantum action could be the minimum action). talking about space here is in the classical physics (normal equations where we calculate speed and distance) but that is the core of clocks in general (time = distance / speed) the shift in seconds hand.  but there’s minimum action (Planck’s scale). mental clock requires action too but different approach. to concise human brain can recognise time unlike clocks (it’s a process). Planck is one of the best former scientists.<br><br>Hopefully the idea is clear, I hardly can focus.<br><br>I think the idea is that time is a bit complicated: why do you need the minute hand and the hour hand? Because time is a process and not just the ticking of the seconds hand, here I am talking about the conventional scale of ordinary clocks , and I am not talking about the scale of atomic clocks, but it is the same idea at the end. but there’s a big difference: clocks can’t recognise the ticks of seconds hand but humans can.<br><br>There’s a mental clock for sure: it’s the result of continuous approximate calculations of dimensions and speed, it’s inaccurate but very effective in usual daily activities such as: is that narrow road is enough to my car to pass through?!, but there’s other type of time which is very accurate and very likely based on physical clock similar to atomic clocks.<br><br>to reach perfection in some shooting sports (repeatable) indicate that there is a very accurate clock (probably more accurate than modern clocks), in human brain (very likely) it is in cerebellum, accompaned with  other accurate caluculqtions such as wind speed,….etc. of course all that happen unknowingly.<br><br>…… <br>By the way, they hide or delete human valuable precious thoughts for theft purposes (many of the irrational thieves wrote books only out of human thoughts), they worked in a systematic collective theft and worked on erasing human traces).
Problem solved  👍
Better to invest in and rely on future generations (they are the only one who can solve the problems of the fundamentals of physics).<br>improve the education system and offer them better living and education conditions.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4570">1:16:10</a> they exaggerate here (environment plays important role in the process of generating personal identity but it’s not the essential part of the process).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4560">1:16:00</a> that’s important part (recognition), that is why I wrote both personal identity and consciousness type one are generated simultaneously in a very complex process by self concept.<br>Notice: I write only for the sake of future generations (your descendants) and science.<br>many sick irrational thieves already have stolen and polluted human thoughts badly (so dangerous because human logic is completely different and passed through human thinking process).

1: 14:90 memory is just a small part of the whole process, but here you can connect what they have mentioned before about DNA to how humans acquired psychological traits through genes from their parents (far more complicated than that).<br>the process of generating personal identity is one of the most complicated process in human brain related to body, memory, environment, cultures,….etc <br>but the phenomenon of transferring psychological traits via heart transplant is related to the same topic,….etc.
I&#39;m not sure if this is what you are trying to say or imply, but if you&#39;re thinking that emotional or memory experiences of parents can effect the DNA of their future children, then that&#39;s simply not the case.  On the mother&#39;s side of things, the DNA in her ovum (eggs) is present at her birth and certainly isn&#39;t being changed.  On the fathers side, the DNA in the sperm he produces is also not being changed by any experience he has stored in his brain.  I also think you may have misunderstood what they meant when referencing to &quot;changes&quot; in DNA.  They are likely talking about gene expression, not actual physical changes in DNA sequences.

@@johnchappell4492 I don’t mean exactly what they said (that can’t maintain the state), but I talk about genes in general.<br>but they are unaware of what’s behind what they have noticed (their interpretations are incorrect).<br>there’s something else far more complicated than that (governed by science and only science).<br>it’s possible to make that as axioms (if you understand who you are then you will be able to recognise which psychological traits you acquired from your mother or your father and which are related to your own experience), it’s possible to turn that to axioms (just understand your personal identity).<br>to concise: it’s something else far more complicated but related to genes too, I think that will take at least few thousands of years of continuous scientific progress for mankind to figure out what is going on.
What they said can’t maintain the states in human brain especially rapidly changing states (there’s something else far more complicated behind that), what they mentioned can’t maintain a complete mental and psychological states for instance in the case of transferring psychological traits via heart transplantation.<br>(too early to figure out the mechanism behind maintaining the state in human brain).
I didn’t want to mention that directly but there is something else uses genes (very advanced coding systems), something else governed by science but very far from humans to grasp (could take up to thousands of years to recognise it).<br>they will figure that out as soon as they recognise that they can’t build living entity from scratch.<br>that has nothing to with so-called gods, …..etc<br>but it’s science, humans can recognise that as soon as they decipher gravity (gravity has nothing to do with that directly, but it will open the gate to reach cycle two).<br>it’s not good to mention that but (everything is governed by science and only science „nothing would come into existence without science whatsoever „). to concise: what they said can’t maintain rapidly and continuously changing states in human brain but there’s something else uses genes and can maintain the states.
It’s not easy to comprehend but this could help: they think that starting from one cell then go to the miracle (they give that ambiguous names such as complexity,…..etc), at the same time they claim that they don’t believe in so-called gods and miracles but at the same time they want things to take place miraculously!<br>everything is governed by science and only science but this existence is far more complicated than that!<br>there are no miracles: nothing will happen miraculously such as  turning complexity into miracles! there’s something else far more advanced and governed by science (nothing would come into existence without science whatsoever), there’s evolution but the interpretations are wrong, it’s possible to start from simple to become more complicated and advanced at the same time in cycle two but cycle one (this universe) never started simple at all (evolution does exist but their interpretations to evolution and life is completely wrong).
It went to far to reach so-called ontology but maintaining the state is important part of what they interpret as life (life is related to cycle two not to cycle one)<br>this universe (cycle one) is built within cycle two (this existence), very likely space is one indivisible unit (current understanding of space is wrong) and how some constants solved the problem of infinity, ….. etc indicate that this universe never came into existence by a mere chance (complexity that leads to miracles doesn’t exist !) <br>this universe built within cycle two for sure, I think that humans need 400 to 2 thousands of years to recognise that (solid scientific evidences).

I was very impressed with your guests.  Certainly surprised of my own level of understanding the concepts expressed in your discussion. Thank you, most informative.  As always Dr. Brian Greene does not disappoint.
Brainiacs want to deal with things like memory with some kind of advanced technology because they don&#39;t know how to do it naturally, but the fact is that memories are dependent on one&#39;s perception of the past. Change your perception of the past, and the memory changes. Memories are also depending on how you evolve in the future. Change into a different person and your perception of reality will change and therefore your perception of memories will change. There&#39;s no one on the earth who understands this better than me. If you want to have a proper discussion about memory, and what kind of education people need to get in order to heal their negative memories and transform themselves into healthy and positive people, the one that you need to interview is me. As you wish, Brian Green. 🙏🏻
How many PHD,s do you hold where is your research located, how many papers have you submitted, that were accepted, im sure if you knew half of what you say, you mite be on this panel, besides nobody wants to hear me me me, i can do this, i did that, but dont give up, with some hard work and get your name out ther,
We want some super duper physics stuff !!!!!
Awesome range of views. Somewhere along I imagined the &quot; synergy&quot; that takes form when Hydrogen and Oxygen give rise to water. I wonder if consciousness expresses it self in the synergy. That it happens invariably and repetitively suggests that the synergy isn&#39;t the cause but the expression by some law of this consciousness. All creatures therefore have this power. It is seemingly more pronounced and nuanced in man.... Thanks for this episode WSF.

To remember something is to create the memory. The moon is not there when you are not looking.
My first memory is from when I was in the back yard with my brothers and a German Shepherd (no surprises there...lol). The weird part is that when we left that house for a different house i was eighteen months old. <br>So I can remember something from when I was a toddler.
My son remembers being about three months old and we can vouch for this as he remembers the fridge being in the breakfast room, not in the kitchen. He can point it to its exact place and he&#39;s right. <br>I remember being in cot and crawling. I also remember sitting in my dad&#39;s slipper and pretending it was a boat. Then I looked up and my dad was so tall! <br>I have many memories of that kind, all from a very early age.
Unfortunately with all the respect to the experts I found the contribution a little poor. How ever B Green shone like always.
Whenever I saw Dr Brian Greene talking, that itself turns into a good memory for me.😊 <br>Lots of love and respect🙏 from India🇮🇳
I find it a bit perplexing that people can assume, limit, their belief to thinking what we see and know is enough to explain something like consciousness or life. What we do know, if we look from a sufficient perspective of the whole, is that life repeats on all scales in all directions, and its safe to assume that we do not know all scales. This makes it hard to think that mind, consciousness, awareness is original, and limited to and a result of the brain as we understand it, that it isn&#39;t a version of something else, like a microcosm of something fundamental. Mind as far as we know is intrinsic to everything, because we cannot know anything without it, if it is intrinsic, then as nature does it must be intrinsic on other scales. Truth is with or without understanding, our job is to find the understanding that reveals truth, and not create truths that we can understand, because our understanding is always behind.
I agree and am mindful of all that exists that we are not aware of but should seek to find
I think... All memory distance is measured: Equivalent to &quot;How to maintain &amp; feed our body!&quot;. Excluded mentally ill, old, accident, family background, or unusual people.
Disagree in the first minute, i don&#39;t think memory stores irrelevant details, emotionals or not.
What do you base that on?

My symbol of “Gaia Tree” is inspired by Greek mythological character, the mother of earth, and all organic life also a grandmother of Zeus.

Ancient wisdom says, pirates, die, violent death.<br>In this particular composition “shadow stencil” gives a flavor of “human pirate’s spirit” of all of us who were using/abusing Earth for hundreds/thousands of years and care less about our grandchildren’s freshwater.<br>I have to admit, execution is fairly bold, but I managed to balance my harmony with dark sky and complex elements communicating directly to each other creating a novelty story that can be interpreted many ways.<br>I have created over 400 images of my trademark “Gaia Tree”

@@petevenuti7355 what I mean is that many who intend to do good, will turn to evil once their vision of what&#39;s good is not followed.

If you understood this video, you will understand why Mr Beast is popular
The phenomenon of media influencers, the individualistic spectacle of a wealthy lifestyle and mindless consumerism will always trump the the intellectual thirst for science in a majority of people, especially here in the US unfortunately.
I think is not initially cause of content more about length cause long content is less viewed cause of attention span degrading most Mr beasts videos under 15 min length easier to absorb , but obviously speaking about science requires longer narrative so makes sense why is long

There are infinite copies of you with exactly the same memory
Don&#39;t worry if there are infinite instances of you and me that have the exact same memories. All of them are causality isolated. It is the same if they don&#39;t exist at all. Sorry about my English. It&#39;s just another bad infinite repited memory haha

Thank you for this ❤ team outterspace
Great talk, Brian! I have a question - Hayabusa2 found 20,000 organic molecules which is basically a VERY TINY number. For reference Avogadro number is 6.023*10^23 so 2*10^4 is a very small number. How are we then so sure that it is from a primordial asteroid and not leakage from earth&#39;s atmosphere or some earth-origin dust particle. Even an entropic argument seems to be in favor of a leakage into the sample collector (there could be innumerable ways of leaking such a minuscule number of molecules). <br><br>How do we definitively know that the sample is 100.00% from that asteroid.
Great to see live WSF meeting.
Absolutely loved this episode. I&#39;m a regular watcher and this one is the best of the year. Thank you Brian for producing this programmes. As a non-scientist, I find watching your programmes one of the best ways to glimpse into the fields of physics and cosmology!
The cost of rocket production has gone down 1/3 because it is now non-union, low benefit, private sector employment working for stock options rather than benefits. It has little to do with 24 hr shift work. Come on Mr. Zurbuchen. Not to turn the conversation into a labor dispute, but it may be greed or the motivation for wealth that drives down costs at the front end. There has been a cultural shift in that regard since the early space program. How do scientists negotiate that phenomenon?
Dumb assumption, that Alien life works like ours and needs the same habitable zone, Alien life may not even need chemistry to work, just magnetics or energy, DUMB ASSUMPTION, NARROW MINDS
I think he should have said &quot;Astronauts should be less like overpaid footballers.&quot;
No inhabitant of planet Earth has ever been in outer space. It seems that the Russians are showing the video with Gagarin as an “excursion” to Kazakhstan. One day you were visited by a “guest from the future” to check who really lives on planet Earth. It took her two years to get here. She told how to remake the rocket for her in order to be able to return home. Unfortunately, she was handcuffed to the rocket to prevent her from getting back. Documentary footage can be seen in the clips that are now on YouTube “Dream Theme” — Тема мечты, (“Travel with an Astronaut”) - Путешествие с космонавтом, “Blue Planet” – Голубая Планета. The rocket was boarded and thus she was able to return. The clips contain videos with footage of men who have nothing to do with astronautics. There is another video where you can see how she “came to visit,” where first one and then another parachute opens for insurance, having met a woman and a girl named Evgenia. The video “Dream Theme” — Тема Мечты ends, a video in which boys are running around some barrel and a bandy-legged man in an orange jumpsuit specially made for him for just walking. For your information, in Outer Space you need a spaceship and not only.... The melody for the Clips was written and played with the German orchestra from Cologne by Sofia-Galinka Romanyuk in 1970 in Moscow. The clips for the singing girl were created on Planet Uranus. She explained the laws of physics to Cosmos researchers, and many of them immediately became “great scientists.” An anecdote from that time.<br>One party official of the USSR (you probably know at what time the country began to be called that) once said: “Among the great Soviet (derived from the word advice) physicists, there are only Jews: Ioffe, Landau, Ginsburg, etc.... It’s good that there is at least one Russian – Khalatnikov.” Yes, they answered him. Only Isaac Markovich remained. This means that the “discoveries” of that time were taken from the Archives of the Civilization that existed here before.<br>Ни один житель из планеты Земля никогда не был в космическом пространстве. Похоже, видео с Гагариным россияне показывают как &quot;экскурсию&quot; в Казахстан. Однажды Вас посетила &quot;гостья из будущего&quot;, чтобы проверить кто на самом деле живет на планете Земля. Ей потребовалось два года, чтобы добраться сюда. Она рассказала как для нее переделать ракету, чтобы иметь возможность вернуться домой. К сожалению, ее привязали наручниками к ракете, чтобы не дать возможность вернуться назад. Документальные кадры можно увидеть в клипах, которые есть сейчас в YouTube «Тема мечты»(«Путешествие с Космонавтом»),«Голубая Планета». Ракету взяли на Абордаж и таким образом она смогла вернуться. В клипах вмонтированы видео с кадрами мужчин не имеющими никакого отношения к космонавтике. Есть еще один ролик, где можно увидеть как она «пришла в гости», где раскрывается сначала один, а потом другой парашют для страховки, встретив женщину и девушку по имени Евгения. Заканчивается клип «Тема мечты», видео на котором мальчишки бегают вокруг какой-то бочки и идет кривоногий мужик в специально пошитом для него оранжевом комбинезоне. К сведению, в Космическом пространстве вам нужен космический корабль и не только.... Мелодию для Клипов написала и играет с немецким оркестром из Кёльна София-Галинка Романюк в 1970 году в Москве. Клипы для поющей девочки были созданы на Планете Уран. Она объясняла исследователям «Космоса» законы физики и многие из них сразу стали «большими учеными». Анекдот того времени. Один партийный чиновник СССР (наверное знаете с какого времени страна стала так называться) как-то сказал: «Среди великих советских (происходит от слова совет) физиков одни евреи: Иоффе, Ландау, Гинсбург и др…. Хорошо, что есть хоть один русский — Халатников». Да, ответили ему. Только, Исаак Маркович и остался. Это к тому, что «открытия» того времени взяты из Архивов Цивилизации, которая тут существовала раньше.
These are so good talks!!!!!! Love them. Great moderation as always by Brian Greene.
Space exploration? More like UNIVERSE DOMINATION and that&#39;s a FACT!
In this era of robotic and ai systems filling less desirable jobs, we need to explore just for job creation. <br><br>Another benefit, Steven Hawking says some disaster will make humans on earth extinct, other estimates less then 1 million, or as soon as 500 million years. <br><br>With the technology we learn from habitating Mars, will be needed here in earth with in this 1000 year to 500 million years and before earth becomes hazardous to life. <br><br>Being prepared to create sustainable life should be the first concern, and we learn that by taking Mars.
If it wasn’t for science… we would not have the things we have today.

That life will be found on other planets, or moons in our galaxy is a given. The bigger question will be the origin of it. The Chicxulub asteroid killed off the dinosaurs when it hit the Yucatán Peninsula 66 million years ago. 25 trillion tons of material (50,000 cubic miles) were ejected from the crater, some of it left the earth&#39;s orbit. Some organisms can survive in space. Over 250 different species of bacteria and fungi can survive, and thrive in outer space The ejected material would have spread through our galaxy like a cloud, and it could have ended up on all the celestial bodies where it could have reproduced. So......yes life forms will be found in our galaxy, but the odds are that it was probably transported from earth 66million years ago.
What about hydrogen from the sun mixing with oxygen in our atmosphere to create our water, star water.
🥲 this made me so HAPPY! 🤓🥳NERDS RULE 🤘🏼😎
&quot;Duck &amp; Cover&quot;  people are STUPID.!😂😮😢
imo the first question would be something like have you seen the princess bride?
This is like watching an alternate reality to the tv show FOR ALL MANKIND.  Aside from that random observation, this conversation is an interesting juxtaposition against the UAP Whistleblower UAP Congressional Hearings. Thanks for sharing.
70 years from Wright brothers to Apollo landings. That still blows my mind.

What a dumb debate.
Don&#39;t focus on distant fantasies. Planet earth and masses of suffering human beings are in desperate need of attention and improvements. Outerspace for the satellites necessary for international communications and weather observations is one thing. Beyond that it&#39;s a total scam, a waste, a selfish, criminal action by a clever, shrewd bunch of devils who are exploiting the masses to fund their hobby. 😉
The golden age of space exploration has yet to begin. India, China, the ESA are making big steps. More startups are joining the race, more countries like Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia are enhancing their space tech. <br>Shit is going to be good
You murdered your best president what a bunch of loosers.

I need help with my new years resolution.  I&#39;ve figured out how to change the stars. <br>My idea for changing the stars includes Orion and Pleiades (Subaru).  I figure it&#39;s time to put something up there that&#39;s relevant to us, don&#39;t you think?  Take Orion&#39;s belt and Betelgeuse becomes the head with a baseball hat.  Below the belt are two legs bending at the knee.  The feet aligning perfectly under the bent knees.  The 3 stars of Orion&#39;s belt align perfectly as the 3 fat belt loops on a baseball uniform.  The spear pointing at &quot;Subaru&quot; is the bat being swung and &quot;Pleiades&quot; is the baseball flying away after being hit.  Put it all together and you get, &quot;THE ALL-STAR.&quot;  In my case, I see a left-handed batter and I imagine a &quot;7&quot; on the jersey. Which makes him, &quot;Mickey.&quot; (As it should be ;-) But you can put any number you want, making, &quot;THE ALL-STAR,&quot; any player you want. It&#39;d  be wrong of me to not, at least, try.  This is me, trying.  Pass it on, please and thank you. Don&#39;t worry, where I come from, crazy is a compliment.  ;-P
U guys will get all the answers once u explore your soul with...that is the ultimate science
I would hope in 100 years we will be interstellar. There need to be some modification to general  relativity to make this happen.
Don&#39;t hold your breath on breaking general relativity.
What needs be found is not a problem with relativity, that&#39;s pretty solid.  It will take insight, and technological developments we can&#39;t really imagine at this time.  But, on the scale of that technological development, a century is quite a big chunk of time.  What&#39;s the answer?  Who knows.  I left my crystal ball behind on the first  trans-pacific passenger flight, only 33 years after the Wright Brothers&#39; first brief, powered, sustained, and controlled airplane flight (1903).<br>But, manned interstellar in a single human lifetime beginning less than a century from now is probably a stretch.  Sadly, nobody in this conversation will live long enough to see the departure even in the best-case scenario.
Love World Science Fest! Welcome back IRL!❤
i thought the introduction was a add for a new paradox game
😮😮😮😮well ingormeti0n good show 😅😅
In worldly conflict we like to war game country vs country.  When it comes to space all of earth bands together - it is wonderful.
Brian, you&#39;re a physicist, your comments about the covid vax sound like cheap commercial for Pfizer - vastly inaccurate!
only 41k views? humanity is doomed
What a BORING discourse! Nothing new, no revelations.......NASA guy is quite amusing......Prof Greene must&#39;ve thought the same as myself and many others. Dull, dull, dull.....
It takes billions of years to create intelligent life.. the bible and kuran  managed to make people dumber in only a few thousand years
I just hope people get smart and look to science to make the world a better place.. religion has damn failed us thats for sure
At 25.53  ..... this is the pinnacle of thw WSF 😂😂😂😂, i love it 😊
I&#39;m sorry Mr. Green but if the speaker guest presence cannot be there with you in person then don&#39;t come!
I can&#39;t tell you how happy I am these videos are back! I think I watched all the previous ones. These discussions are the best! 👏
all science and space program of human are fake 1 billion % and many many proof
Wish u do these shows outside US and Australia too, like in India! We need it so much!
lunatics still talking about black holes, dark energy and matter, big bang, expanding universe or age of universe...people long time know that these are silly fantasies
None is out there looking for us.<br>They are looking at us, a fallen world.
Let&#39;s face it. All this interest &amp; hype about the moon etc right now owe it to China. Just like how in the past the Soviet Union launched the US into a space race in the 60s. And to talk of a golden age of space exploration in the next few decades without also talking about what China &amp; Russia is doing is I think a ridiculously stunning, foolish, unscientific omission, on a bigger scale than the foolishness of banning China from the ISS.
First you jump up and down and fart 3 Times and call your mom
Wtf I thought he brought out a clone when he introduced that Brian fellow.

Enough of the vaccine propaganda. So thankful I didn’t take that poison.
On the subject of ChatGPT... please do an updated episode on AI soon! I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you could get Sam Altman on if you approached him through the right channels. He, somebody like Matt Wolfe (who is very up-to-date on AI developments), and two AI researchers/developers/ethicists who can discuss and ask questions about technical details would be a really interesting synergy.
Do you think that the opening joke, particularly the answer: &quot;You asked me to deliver the joke in the voice of Brian Green&quot; is true?
Very cool stuff.
Perhaps a better joke would have been: &quot;Why did the astronaut cross the black hole?&quot;  The same punchline, &quot;to get to the other side of the universe.&quot;  OK, so I&#39;m not a professional comedy writer.
An intelligence superseding us by a billion years. Sheesh. We could be staring &quot;them&quot; right in the face and not even recognize it as life. They would be unimaginably different.
I don&#39;t think so. The elements that make us would be the same elements that make them. I imagine all life in the universe is much more similar to earth organisms than we think.
The probabilistic argument about so many galaxies with so many stars is very one sided. Approach it from the other end. Take all the billions of steps that had to go &#39;right&#39; to get something like us here and consider the probability of those step happening and happening in a sufficiently short time frame so all those billions of step could happen within the lifetime of the universe. If in those billions of steps you can find a few dozen that had only a 50% chance of happening there is statistically less than 1 civilization in the visible universe. It is easy to believe that given the numbers of stars it&#39;s a statistical certainty we&#39;re not alone, but if you dive into the statistics of what had to happen to get us here it&#39;s equally easy to conclude that the odds are so stacked against it that it&#39;s a statistical certainty we are alone. Without a decent understanding of what it takes to get life started, what is needed to get to technology and all the ways that life can be wiped out or set back it&#39;s essentially impossible to say whether we&#39;re alone unless we find another civilization. Based on what know now, we can conclude the universe is teeming with life, we&#39;re alone or anything in between with equally reasonable assumptions. <br><br>That all said, if you&#39;ve to make a bet, bet on technological life is out there. Though based on what we know scientifically dubious, it&#39;s a position that is &#39;easy&#39; to be proven correct and virtually impossible to be proven wrong while the position of we&#39;re alone is virtually impossible to be proven right and &#39;easy&#39; to be proven wrong.
really? did they go to the moon? I do not thing so !!!
Are you a smart person? I do not &quot;thing&quot; so !!!
We went to the moon, you absolute brainlet.
This program is airing simultaneously with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Once we worked with Russia.  I am thinking about the recurring theme of Star Trek.  World War III.  In Star Trek, we humans survived World War III.  Hopefully we will not have a World War III!  Hopefully we will bring our problems to the negotiating table.
It is ww3, by proxy, and via the internet
Why do men feel the need to dominate discussions?
a robot can also not die in space.
oops...we´re already out there everyone
Aude &amp; Thomas both dodged Brian&#39;s question about risking human lives.  That&#39;s a crucial difference in approach.  SpaceX built Dragon to meet NASA&#39;s safety requirements,  but future companies could fly any janky missions so long as the crew sign their disclaimers.  It&#39;ll speed up expansion in capabilities enormously.
I dunno...  The Titan didn&#39;t do much to advance deep sea exploration...
Yes, much of what I was taught years ago is outdated.  That’s OK and I am aware that it is outdated because of cutting edge science that is becoming known to me through this program!  What an exciting time to be alive!
interesting conversation, good question of topic to be honest eventhough some were not answered. its is hard.
Thank you very much for this very interesting event.<br>There is hope for the earth and the humans if we can work together across the borders.<br>If the population are contiuing to increase on earth we will need to colonice Mars and other planets.<br>Let Science bring peace amoung people all over the world and i am sure that in a hundred year the world will be a better place for all of us.<br>There is no limit out there so let go for it....👍❤️

The most difficult part of searching for Extraterrestrial  signals/Extraterrestrial Life is as in the Drake equation,<br><br>N = <br>R* x Fp x Nc x. Fl x Fi x Fc x L<br><br>Where N is the # of intelligent civilizations capable of communication with us ...<br><br> R* is the rate of star formation with in the Milkyway Galaxy ...<br><br>Fp is the # fraction of stars that have planets in the habitable zone<br><br>Nc is the # of planets that could support life per star with planets<br><br>FL is the fraction of life-supporting planets that develop life<br><br>Fi the fraction of those planets that support life develop intelligence<br><br>Fc is the fraction of intelligent civilizations that develop communication tech<br><br>L = The TIME that those communication capable intelligent civilizations exist <br><br>I think eventually each of the variables will eventually have a relative number assigned. As future discovery and exploration answers these questions <br><br>If you start out with 300 billion stars and we now know that on average,<br><br> every star has planets the average number of planets orbiting in the habitable zone per star =1<br><br>This gives us 300 billion planets that are in the habitable zone of there relative star. <br><br>If 1% of those 300 billion planets develop life ... this gives us 3 billion planets supporting life <br><br>If 1% of those 3 billion planets that support life develop intelligent civilizations, <br><br>this  gives us 30,000,000 intelligent civilizations in our galaxy alone <br><br>If 1% of those 30 million intelligent civilizations are capable of communicating with us, there would be 300,000 Extraterrestrial civilizations capable of communicating with us in our own galaxy    BUT    the last part of the equation has a degree of difficulty that is literally astronomical  ... The longevity factor ... how long an intelligent communicating civilization can exist. <br><br>Since humanity has only existed as a civilization for approximately 75,000 years and the Milkyway is approximately 13.2 billion years old<br><br>Space-Time could be the dimension that prevents us from being aware of a universe so   complex ....It would be like if our universe were only 2 dimensions ... existing in a 2 dimensional  universe, we would only know about width and length ... <br><br>Discovering Extraterrestrial Life, even if just fossilized microbes, would be the most profound discovery in human history
I think the Fermi Paradox is probable. We will probably destroy ourselves with advanced technology weapons . The warning signs are already visible .Do you think the likes of Russia, with such weapons ,won&#39;t end in disaster .It won&#39;t matter who else exists in the Universe .When we are capable enough , we are destructive enough.
Physics is badazz.
Excellent show. Brian is a great interviewer. I was unaware of the details of these coming missions. So exciting.
How&#39;d they get out of the prime directive question?
its good to be back
I&#39;m hoping that in 100 years we have moved on into and past our solar system, and have at least sent a probe to a neighboring system, maybe Alpha Centauri ?
In a hundred years I hope we are building interstellar spaceships
You didnt actually take the vax, did you?? 🤣🤣🤣 HAHAHAHAHA!
we would likely have to build a large amount of infrastructure first in the Sol system before considered leaving into interstellar space.

To my mind, I would say that having a remote simulated gravity space station orbiting around the sun in the asteroid belt, would be the most economical solution to long term space habitability. Since many of the required resources are already there for the taking (metals, water, fuels, etc.) and they aren&#39;t trapped by planetary gravity which makes them relatively easy to mine and transport.
Smash The rocks together. Asteroid belt. We can build a new planet with gravity and all. engineer a a nice sustainable nuclear reaction in the middle. put in pipe works as we smash the rocks together. This is the Intelligent choice.
Are these only live in Australia? I would love to listen to something like this in person but I&#39;m in Texas. Either way, thank you wsf and Dr Greene!!
I think they&#39;re normally in New York (but I could be mistaken).  I was surprised when they mentioned this one is in Australia.
Thank you sir
Humanity does come together with space exploration and science. I love that WSF is live on stage again. Welcome back, and keep em coming!
The big lie of the vaccine how can you stand there with a straight face
They didnt actually take the vax, did they?? 🤣🤣🤣 HAHAHAHAHA!
I have already design I rover that can mine agricultural task,construction,rebuilding it self so human could survive interplanetary species in the short run...
Porque to aqui
Love Brian also. We have no evidence yet for life out there but just the fact many government agency have pretty much accepted the possibility of life out there. Just that acceptance, without evidence speaks volumes. Govt saying “yes, there probably out there” so what.
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for having me. You know, recently NASA was considering sending me to space to study string theory. But they quickly changed their minds when they realized, in zero gravity, it&#39;s impossible to keep the strings from tangling!&quot;<br>Yep, not very good yet.
I dont understand why we&#39;re needing this new tecnologies, big preparation and training to send men on the moon! We&#39;ve already done in 1969! Am I right?
Yeah, but wasn&#39;t very safe, killed three people on the ground, and almost killed another three in space(from 24 that were launched in whole program ) , and only 12 humans walked on the moon, and for very short periods of time (like some only few hours and others only a little more than two days ), we will need to make those things safer and continuous , and with all tehnologycal progress of the last 50 years we actually are knowing very little about the moon(the closest celestial bodies, witch should be the most knowed ) , so are good reasons to send humans again on the moon surface, and even beyond.
Turned off the video at exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm8OHGvl4Oc&amp;t=324">5:24</a>, after the speaker brought op covid-, only to spread lies about it and push the lying mainstream narrative/agenda. How much did you get paid to push their agenda?<br>&quot;Vaccines being tested&quot;, they obviously weren&#39;t tested in that extremely short period. The many casuals and people who are still suffering from them, are proof of that.<br>It has NOT &quot;helped&quot; us get back to a more normal life. The covid period was there for the biggest wealth transfer in our history, from the normies and poor to the richest 1% &#39;elites&#39;. It was there to enforce and test more control over us by the government. The elite like Bill Gates, big tech and governments were never this aligned at forcing more control over us to push their evil agenda&#39;s.<br>Won&#39;t listen to-, or watch a thing from this POS. Hard down vote.
Excellent scientists keep the good jobs..
100 yes from now I hope we will manipulate the seven galaxy or universe and use them efficiently sufficiently and sustainable..
Thank I appreciate you all
It is so nice to have you back!!! I watched most of your videos made during the lockdown but it is much nicer to see a live performance. 😀😀😀 greetings from Ukraine🇺🇦

Good panel.  Respect to others home is imperative when you start exploring.
Really! We start off with the jab and pharma. Wtf
Was the vaccine intro necessary
😂
😂😂. I know right.
Was the vaccine necessary!!!!
Dont push the vaccine bullshit. The rest I am excited for.
How could you have this conversation and not mention spaceX. They are literally paving the way in this area and changed the way we do everything space. I donno man im a huge fan of wsf but this is inscrutable.
they did mention it

Im in the floor rolling in laughter give me a few minutes and then i will wrestle my way back to standing and be furious at how badly we all have been played Scam of the Century to indoctrine and embezzle trillions for lining demonic pockets and used for every bad thing including our own demise Boy ,houston you really had many problems The biggest is they were using walkie talkies right down the hall and then disney studios and such  Besides slipup confessions and whoops extra film Not to mention fantasic cgi with same old blue marble HOW CAN A SPACE AGENCY LOSE 60S TECHNOLOGY WITH GOLD ALUMINUM FOIL AND PICNIC TABLE UMBRELLA ON A SOUPED UP DUNE BUGGY THAT IN 2000S STILL CANT FIND BUT CAN REVERSE ENGINEER SKYCRAFT BAHAHAHAHAHAH
Demons aren&#39;t real, numb nuts.
Humans in space to learn sustainability?   Pure BS.   It&#39;s easier to learn how to do that without adding the difficulty of space into the equation.  And we haven&#39;t bothered to learn it on earth so why will adding the huge difficulty and expense of space change things?   All nonsense.   And we&#39;ll send humans for &quot;inspiration&quot;?  Sheesh.  Grow up, people?
It&#39;s a good thing people like you are few to non existent in the scientific community. If humanity as a whole agreed with your abysmal outlook, we would&#39;ve never reached the level of technology and knowledge we have today.<br><br>Here&#39;s a tip: Speak less, and listen more. You might learn something.
I disagree.  Everything up through Apollo and Shuttle was just our down payment. I believe we are now entering &quot;the golden age of space exploration. &quot;  If you agree, please give it a thumbs up 👍
Correction.  I shall call Apollo,  The Shuttle,  and ISS as a proof of concept.  What happens next will become the Golden Age.  <br><br>But what will happen after that?  The real road block is what happens when we&#39;re ready to move out of our solar system?
Nobody mentioned that the supposed chances of life elsewhere are entirely dependent on the assumptions behind genesis of life on earth - a complete unknown.  The chances were considered high (because of so many planets) and yet when considering the level of  development of any alien civilization the chances were considered to be &quot;nil&quot; that they would be at our own developmental level.  Nobody minds making assertions that life is &quot;certain&quot; elsewhere yet the chances of it being at same level are &quot;nil&quot;?  This is really bad reasoning!  <br><br>Nobody knows what the likelihood of life is.  So far all the evidence is life has only happened once - here on earth.  This is too uncomfortable for folks to grok?

No one likes to discuss Venus.
People speaking about space exploration when we haven&#39;t even explored our own planet is perplexing.  We&#39;ve dug a mere 7.5 miles into the Earth.  We don&#39;t know much about our own planet yet carry such hubris about our understanding &amp; abilities to explore other planets.
We know what&#39;s in the dirt. It&#39;s the ocean that needs exploration. Regardless your statement is stupid. We can do both.

I&#39;m positive I&#39;ll enjoy the replay better.  The obnoxious trolling theists in the live chat pissed me off.
Checked the live chat replay. You weren&#39;t lying. How pathetic.

Thats the best way <br>Especially with a company like neura link we can one day implement human consciousness and experience into artificial intelligence to explore the depths of space with minimal causalities

This could be the age of the first great expanse
It will be. It&#39;s coinciding with advancements in ai and robotics. It is much cheaper to keep ai functioning in space than keeping a person alive. This will propel the gaining of knowledge which will lead to colonization in our solar system.

Yeah I shut off the video. Can&#39;t believe that such recent event is already being twisted even on WSF. All media, governments and scientists already forgotten how wrong they were about meny things and how cruel was the treatment of working class (i.e. policemen putting their boots on people faces because they didn&#39;t wear a mask that didn&#39;t protect from anything anyway)

First time watching live, guess it will be the first time not watching at 2x speed hehe, still looking forward to another wholesome discussion.
2X is a bit rough.  I find 1.5 more enjoyable.
The next generation and I’m right in line to be a forerunner
I remember when Hubble launched, I was almost 14 years old. They were going to build the Terrestrial Planet Finder telescope, but it was canceled in 2011. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it happens again.

Love how they emphasis &quot;the largest space telescope ever built&quot; when it&#39;s only been the 2nd of 2 ever built
Not to interject politics into these amazing discoveries but precisely to do so…<br><br>Free market, trickle-down, small government stupidity leads to poverty of thought not to these exciting new dimensions of human knowledge.<br><br>Vote smart not stupid!
when they fundamentally rewrite everything about the big bang - will they take back alot of nobel prizes in astronomy and astrophysics? 😁
No. One thing leads to the other. Question; why would you care? I doubt you’re in the running for one. Lol
Is there any chance that the universe is moving away because we are trying to find its boundaries?
I&#39;d much rather we built space telescopes than cathedrals.
is gravitational telexcope would be able to go beyond james web telescope, How big would it be?
That was an extremely interesting prodcast, that I truly enjoyed! Thank you
Brian is so good to make complicated terms easy to understand by a layman. And his presence on stage is so laid-back. He&#39;s a gem in the Physics world
In an ideal world, every country would be forced to spend certain percentage of its military budget (say 10%) on scientific space program.I mean, they are hell bent to destroy the planet, then they should also invest in seeking for plan-B worlds.<br>That means, the increased $$$ in these programs would attract more talented guys. The way I see it now, these people in this sector are not the most intelligent or innovative bunch humanity can offer.
If education was a pentagon priority, we’d have more PHD’s than idiots. Then, we’d not need a pentagon.

The most important fundamental you need to recognize is the very first verse of the Bible  IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. Genesis 1:1. Why because you are dealing with a mathematical problem that is backed by intelligence. Until then you can understand nothing about the Truth of Creation .

5,312 confirmed planets outside of our solar system...pretty cool data!!
Very interesting, but how many times did the folks say, &quot;actually&quot;? I gave up counting.
I tend to disagree with the 20 to 30 year time span of insights gleaned from the JWST, especially with the advent of AI.  The speed of data analysis and insights from it is set to change exponentially.
I would like to witness each of these scientists, human beings, looking directly into the camera and asking the political, corporate and religious leaders, from all over planet earth, one question. &quot;When collaborating scientist, from all over planet earth, discover life elsewhere, out in the cosmos, will you &quot;leaders&quot; attempt to destroy that life as you attempt to destroy life on planet earth every day? 😢
This is interesting...<br>&quot;The James Webb Space Telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). NASA is the lead partner on the project and has overall responsibility for the Webb mission.&quot;

Part 3: I personally think that applying the required habitability conditions for ourselves to other planets is a huge disservice to science especially based on temperature. It basically assumes other living organisms would need the same conditions we do. When it&#39;s argued that we evolved om this planet. While other organisms could evolve uniquely on their planet. We still don&#39;t know without a doubt that there&#39;s no living organisms on the planets within our own solar system.
Part 1: &quot;Dark matter&quot; is completely speculation and theory. Despite millions if not billions of dollars no models or the particle Collider has proven. It&#39;s amusing to see them play with the term &quot;dark energy&quot;, while trying to avoid the word &quot;electricity&quot;. They are trying their hardest to not acknowledge that there&#39;s more proof of an &quot;Electric Universe&quot;. Which some test have shown similar if not the same type of spiral formations of galaxies. Which is far closer to providing an explanation of the formation of galaxies than the made up &quot;dark matter&quot; theories.

My goodness, Australian scientists sound as if they have marbles in their mouths.  The first guy Carl is clearly intelligent but was barely comprehensible.  And if the lady in part two , Michelle, is a lead science communicator, then it really speaks to how far behind in science communication Aussies have to go, particularly when you compare them to how easy to understand their American counterparts are.  It&#39;s not just a question of accent, but of clarity of expression.  Weird.
No scientific background of my own. Yet having watched all the WSF features, all of the “History of the Universe” and “Kosmos” channel videos I truly applaud the effort and work of these brilliant minds to bring about and share their discoveries with all of Mankind.

Ah yes, I&#39;m sure E.T. observers are incredibly impressed with Joe Biden.

Brian Greene is the kind of guy to address the man on the screen before the one in front of him
hey, I&#39;m just a plumber it&#39;s plumbing some shit. What is the fact that aliens are seeing with big eyes indicates that they may have pain from two off red stars. Big eyes means low light long wavelength.
Eyes are for studying the composition of milky way galaxy. Good experience from this conversation.
Junk science.
fantastic, fantasic discoveries, fantastic, but we are not going to tell you what is fantastic. that is so fantastic!
OMG, all they show are simulations, cartoons. DID WEBB BLOW UP?<br>ANSWER ME THIS<br>Since galaxies travel in space time as they cross the universe, emitting light along the way, then we should be able to observe the same galaxy at different places in the sky, different places in the life of the galaxy and universe, by figuring out the direction of the galaxy and its speed, then mapping the universe forward and backward in spacetime and making observations there. IN OTHER WORDS,, as an example, If Galaxy A is observed to be 1 billion light years away when the telescope aims at in say in Andromeda, and we could extrapolate or guess which way it came and/or which way it is going then we could find it elsewhere in the sky, say at 2 billion years ago, and half a billion years ago. WHERE IS THIS WRONG?
This is an interesting question. I believe in order to observe an object at two difference places in spacetime simultaneously from our perspective, that object would need to be moving faster than the speed of light (which, according to our current understanding, is not possible).<br>Imagine holding a laser pointer and pointing its laser at a wall. You can move your arm up and down as fast as you want, but at any given moment, the laser will only be hitting the wall at a single point. If your arm could teleport upward instantaneously (ignoring the speed of light), only then would the laser hit the wall at two places at once. Earth is the wall, observing incoming light;<br>The laser pointer is the galaxy we wish to observe;<br>The laser itself is the light emitting from that galaxy, traveling towards Earth.<br>The laser pointer has to move faster than its laser in order for lasers to hit the wall at two points simultaneously. Similarly, the galaxy would have to move faster than its emitted light to be seen by the Earth in two points simultaneously.
Your answer starts off funny. &quot;... to observe an object at two different places in spacetime simultaneously from our perspective&quot; The observer is also our perspective, right? The observer is at on point in spacetime, let&#39;s call it the present. The thing we are observing is not visible because it&#39;s light of the present is leaving it and will take light eons to reach us where we were at what we called the present, now far away and in the past. Light is fast, but not instantaneous. Space is big, real big. We see the light of the object from the past as it reaches us from a time and place long ago and far away (don&#39;t even think about light traveling in a straight line, it does, but it&#39;s not necessary for our problem). That light has reached our present. We look in a different part of the sky. We see an object whose light has reached us in the present, that light traveled from somewhere far away and in a different place. If we could map a trajectory between those two lights, at appropriate speed and direction, we could show those are the same object, changed and shaped by space and time. QED LOL   Let me add this. SUPPOSE the light is from a galaxy and that galaxy is orbiting in a cluster. We might be able to analyze the cluster in multiple projections. It might even end up on one exposure from Webb 13 billion light years, more and less, a few rotations...
Well u zoom telescope at point B in space and then wait billion plus few years to see the light from this galaxy when it gets to point B?
They are just all so positive and pleasant to listen to .. ..AND...may I add (?) They are just so talented....Here you can clearly see that it really is the &quot;desire&quot; that makes the work! What a great enthusiasm they show! They love their job...nice to watch...Bravo !<br><br>Imagine if ALL workplaces had such a cool atmosphere?? Ohhh? haha! .😁
More raw data next to composite images is required to afford the credibility to such necessary explorations.
Great program, but why get politically negative, Brian?
Sorry but I need to go for now  have a wonderful day thank you
Its amazing ryt
Hi John
But i am tired,
Well I tell u my friend how is it
Yes my friend  sir green, if I can’t figure it in his actions,  im going to  his words
Hey guys. I have an idea. What about we consider that the backhoes in the centre of each galaxy could be the place that some kind of existence enters our universe and it converts to matter and energy in our universe. Like when water makes a vortex  as it sinks in a hole, the other side of the hole it forms an expanding vortex. For an observer who looks at this vortex from the other side it look like all the water is turning around a space that there&#39;s no water in it at all. Maybe we are on the other side of a vortex that connects our universe to the other universe. Ofcourse we need to create a mathematical model for this idea
Surely it&#39;s now logical reasoning that indeed the Timeline for the Big Bang has to be wrong or even if there was an event that was not the first Big Bang. It&#39;s all because this incredible piece of Human scientific engineering tech James Webb has now been discovered with redshift tech, proving that it is not 13.8  billion years. IF as reported observed Stars and Galaxys further away in time anything viewed beyond the 13.8 Billion cut-offs must make that number redundant. I have never understood the evidence or reasons that there was indeed nothing before this massive event, I have always leaned on the theory of a coming together of two supermassive Black Holes a massive singularity event that was a dominant presence in a much smaller uncluttered farther spread out universe. It&#39;s a human trait that you must have a start and end all things are not finite, and space is not defined like that nothing scientifically allows something to come from that nothing it does not, relatively speaking for every action there is a reaction cause, and effect. Now with quantum mechanics what relativity thought to be nothing was actually something. Now incorporating a quantum field a vacuum is no longer vacuous or empty with many subatomic particles in residence. to me traveling back to any Galaxy that is as old as 12 plus billion years mean that these galaxies all took million of years to be able to form and there way before the theoretical age of the Universe.

thanks WSF for always being so kickass. go JWST!
i really dont get all those Trump bashing tbh, it&#39;s ridiculous, on other part of the world we get it, you dont like him, he looks stupid, said things that are stupid, but unlike his opponents he doesn&#39;t have blood on his hand and speak what he think is the truth, he may be corrupted in the business, but certainly not to the extent others are, Obama, Biden, Bush, Clinton, those have bloods on their hands everybody knows this.<br>So actually, i&#39;m really wondering why is it that Trump is always treated like this.<br>You guys should make yourselves a favor, and just stop with that.
Legit question to all scientists. When are we going to get the star trek &quot;telescope&quot; what I mean is how they can zoom in like a camera across light-years of distance and read the name on the other guys ship. Why can we not zoom in with our space observatories
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. One paper using discredited old hypothesis did not overturn current lamda CDM model of our universe.
THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE GOING UP IN SMOKE !!!<br>So Good bye &quot;Big Bang, and &quot;Expanding Universe&quot;. Which certain branches of Science have always pointed out, are PURELY HYPOTHETICAL ! <br>MATHEMATICS you need to understand is NOT part of Science, despite Albert Einsteins best attempts to convince people otherwise !!!<br>THE ABUSE OF THE DOPPLER EFFECT referred to as Blue or Red shift, is claimed to prove Galaxies are moving towards or away from each other. But as MANY real Research Scientists have repeatedly PROVEN. IT IS NOT the Doppler effect that accounts for nearly all Galaxies being slightly red or occasionally blue ! Galaxies with a red tint (around 90%) is because 75% of all stars in the Universe are small red dwarfs. Virtually invisible singularly but on mass account for the red tint. Blue being rare accounts for the occasional Galaxy that has a high quantity of very large Blue White Stars, such as our neighbouring Galaxy Andromeda. Which is NOT going to crash into our Galaxy at all, as its blue tint has nothing to do with movement, and everything to do with its high percentage of very large blue white stars.  <br>Sadly this &quot;LECTURE&quot; is 90% THEORETICAL GARBAGE - SO NOT FACTUAL PROVEN SCIENCE.
PHILOSOPHY - TODAY THEY CALL IT THEORETICAL SCIENCE - ARE WE BEING CONNED ? <br>THEORY as your dictionary will tell you means: Quote &quot;A collection of IDEAS&quot; Unquote.<br>So EVERYTHING a Theoretical Scientist (PHILOSOPHER) says, does NOT NEED to be proven ! Indeed there is so much money is this deceptive field today, that it now accounts for 50% of the people making up the &quot;American Scientific Community&quot;. And yet they deal in Philosophy, which they now want to call THEORETICAL SCIENCE. This is a BRAZEN CON, AND NOT FACTUAL RESEARCH SCIENCE AT ALL !!!<br><br>Before ANY THEORY can be raised to the level of SCIENTIFIC LAW, research has to be completed, producing the EVIDENCE to support the THEORY, before the relevant INSTITUTE for that branch of Science, sits to consider the evidence, upon which they can either refuse or raise the Theory to SCIENTIFIC LAW.<br><br> But of course these &quot;Theoretical Scientists&quot; have already got their money giving talks like the one above, where tickets are now in excess of $250+ each. So Research, Proof, not on your life, this monkey Brian Greene is just another clever CON Artist !
LOGICAL...Universe since then is ALREADY INFINITE,I don&#39;t know why This some Scientists they BELIEVE in the Wrong Thing.. How can you BELIEVE in big Bang..it came from NOTHING...that is Stupidity..I give an Example..do you think you can control your Satellite or what ever machine you invented without Human Control or Created to move that machine... that&#39;s a BIG BIG IMPOSSIBLE.I don&#39;t know why humans are Scientists Brain is only an ATOM compared to the brain of the CREATOR.😅
Thought rings are formed by impacts ?

So interesting , fantastically enjoyable. I love it.
We are like 7 billion in strength in this cosmos. Wish everybody had the luxury to live in mind and achieve greater heights.
Needs wholistic changes. Hard work ahead - for real human potential - realised. Fare thee well.
Add in a scientist that will bring a religious and philosophical perspective
Why?
Very fascinating interviews and discussions. Thank you
Your &quot;Trump&quot; jibe, completely ruined the show.
Drink! 🍸 🍷🍹🍺🥃🥂🍻🧉<br><br><br><br><br>Every time Stefanie Milam says; &quot;Fantastic&quot; 😁👍
Why do you people keep pushing this crap on here as if it&#39;s fact ?? There&#39;s not one person whose ever witnessed a star being born..
Don’t have to witness anything. It’s been observed
Brian Greene skipped over her opportunity to close out with her concept or exoplanets
Maybe soon we will see JWST data help refine and revise our various standard candles.
Alway brilliant 👍
I mean seriously, our observational capabilities have gone through a couple magnitudes in the last 100 years. It&#39;s as bananas as going from Wright brothers to Apollo landings in 70 years.
... many ? ... few ! ... JWST appears to have humbled us, to the point of realizing the extent of the speculative nature of our physical sciences ... a giant step forward ... also interesting the high degree of speculation, qualification and apparent evasion of revealing possible factual information here ... seems that it is very difficult to reveal that the answers simply are not measurably known ... the third segment guests are refreshingly candid about this ... bravo ...onward ...
Thanks for the the interview.
I just heard that the universe is now older than about 24 billion LY.
When I first started watching Brian Greene on the stream presenting talks on quantum mechanics, physics experiments, he was just about the age of these young scientists. It&#39;s a testament to Greene how many audiences he has reached bringing the message of the cosmos to the world.
I enjoyed watching all the various Cosmology in Crisis presentations on different channels.
brill. a good one
i always thought it was uranus neptune and saturn that had rings
Please, you make everything, grace of America.... it’s NOT! <br>It’s ALL our world, the whole of it.<br>Get off of believing your better or know more, our World is ours, not yours
Excellent.  Very Informative.
Fantastic
I hope we find the geometric shape of the universe with the jwst
Math is NOT physics!!!
This should be hyped as the scientific comic con. Or the NBA finals or super bowl. Get Neil deGrasse Tyson to host it. Children could actually get hyped about science. (Public)Schools shows you one tray at a time and hopes you see the forest at the end
Thanks to all of for taking time &amp; sharing the exciting findings!
Brian Greene my good sir, please tell us about the non-human intelligences lol
Jon Evans put it together. The Universe is not expanding. It is easily looked at as a giant ball of energy (the Higgs Field) as energy spins and becomes quarks atoms matter galaxies and so forth. It moves through space along filaments INWARD. The CMB moves in our location at 67.5 m/s The Galaxies at 74m/s (byebye expansion of space and anyone who tries to use it any longer. you shall be tar&#39;d and feathered) As these galaxies move inward they form clusters and move toward the center of Gravity. The Great Attractor in our case and then the SHapely Super Cluster. DARK FLOW is the (only dark word that has any truth to it) flow of everything moving toward that location. Eventually things will turn into black holes and hawking radiation and one giant party at the end of &quot;time&quot; (thats for another episode) Time is Energy. Time/Energy=Mc2. All Matter is spinning energy. Spinning Energy combines to slow down time. Lots of Spinning Energy = Gravity Wells aka black holes and such. Light Has Energy. Light gets Bent by Higher densities of Energy. You all just solved everything by reading this. The Universe is infinite. Time is relative to the observer. The observer being the Higgs field aka the Universe is it starts on the outskirts and moves toward the center of gravity for the easiest image to make in your mind.
Wonderful knowledge 👍
We are looking at millions and millions of years back in time. What we are looking at do not exist anymore. <br>Galaxies are even a life on other planets are endless.
Shameful …. Brilliant but has to go and insult half of America that actually appreciated what Trump did for the economy….  Biden has been a fumbling joke…. Don’t have to be a scientist to see that. Anyone liking their out of this world grocery bills lately???
New view, new theories.
How it started is out of our reach, what&#39;s even further away is the why. Most humans think it blew from a tiny point it&#39;s how big that point was we don&#39;t know yet. My hat of to all scientists, because what they have achieved since their coming into being in their field&#39;s. Jaw dropping. 🤓🖖✌️
Awesome. This kind of stuff makes me proud to be a human.
Fascinating!
Trust your kings.<br>We are doing our best to get it working.<br>I am not going to back down.<br>Be a rainbow today.<br>Let us move together.
From a layman’s perspective I see three possibilities so far:<br><br>1. The Universe is far older and the calculations from what has been largely thought of as reliable data is simply incorrect.<br><br>2. Galaxies formed much faster in the early Universe (with very different characteristics) due to concentrations of dark energy.<br><br>3. This one is reaching out there - The gravitational lensing is far more powerful than calculated and we are actually seeing galaxies from an earlier or even a neighboring Universe? If so, wouldn’t it render our distance data irrelevant…or is that just nuts? Please someone let me know if it is.
Most people want to meet Brad Pitt ….. I want to meet Brian ❤️
That the universe has grown hotter, faster, and bigger. Reminds me of blowing a balloon, then bursting as it grows bigger, faster, and hotter.
Ty❤❤❤❤
in a hundred odd years these people will be laughed at... just look at history
good presentation though
​@@justinwalker4475Talking to oneself is something to consider that something might be wrong
Every 100 years you could look back and laugh at people 100 years ago. Thats exactly what you want. It means you’re learning and growing. Not all ideas or explanations pan out,.. but its still better to try doing them than sit on your thumbs and try nothing.
@jasonnugent963  my bad, Very bad
the music ruins it
Why would anyone be concerned about divulging information on something inert as gas, dust, and various elements when most any information cornering the Cosmos can be found Online?

Looks like that the gas cloud and dying star is more likely that is how that looks like of how our own solar system was created let there be light....the is the debris of no different of magnetic particles proton of attraction 🧲 creating a ball like proton of circle 🔴 and the thing that goes around it of positive and negative force and energy etc...🔎🕵️
Boothy 3 course
I loved it all right up until you decided that advanced alien civilizations would question human reasoning based on Trump&#39;s election... you don&#39;t think that the past 100+ years with Hitler, Stalin, the holocaust, Vietnam, Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Rwanda, Bosnia, weaponized viruses, human trafficking, global warming, etc etc would be what would disappoint or disgust an intelligent civilization? Really? Trump? 😢
The fact you brought politics into this by disparaging Donald Trump is really disappointing  it shows that even at your level of intellect  you are still capable of falling foul of indoctrination and irrational hate makes me think maybe we aren&#39;t ready to interact with other intelligent life
They know absolutely nothing about whats happening out there, pretending that whatever they make up is whats actually happening, WTF do they know about what happened back then??!! They ask such stupid questions!
On a read between the lines level Brian Greene is an absolute savage on many occasions
These images are disproving all their theories.  Totally destroying their false narrative.  So they have to come up with another theory to propagate their Big Bust.
Does anyone else find it interesting that the two snapshots of the pillars of creation (shown during the opening) show so little change in the gas cloud&#39;s size and shape? Really brings home how large and far away these things must be. Does anyone know offhand how many years between the two snapshots?
Since I discovered this channel and many others, Now I am a big fan of YouTube as a knowledge platform if you find the proper channels. I even have the premium account. Thanks Brian🎉❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=4844">1:20:44</a> Why the hate on one of the better POTUS&#39;s that we&#39;ve had?
Y’all can’t take a joke. Trump said horrible things about multiple people and you think Brian’s comment was “hate”? Get real.
@@DaytonWhite96 everyone has an opinion. Glad I&#39;m not getting canceled for expressing mine.
It seems we have a long way to go.  Our understanding of the universe is changing as data comes from James Webb.<br>Thank you very much for this wonderful program Prof. Brian Greene
Can we gat a IMAX movie of the discoveries.  I&#39;d love that and I&#39;m sure many others would.
I love Brian Greene...ty for all you do....
If by big bang everything started at once, so how can we see the past events like formation of stars, why every particle in universe is not on same time frame as it started in same moment of big bang.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=800">13:20</a> - Am I watching a Monty Python skit? Do these people really get paid for this? There are millions of people doing important jobs that directly affect our lives every day that don&#39;t make a fraction of the money that these unproductive scientists do! I find that a reordering of the universe is in order!
Just like the &quot;scientists&quot; of the past thought that the Earth was the center of the Universe, we now believe that just on the edge of our observable universe are the very first galaxies and stars! Such hubris and obnoxious selfishness. Unbecomming of science and true knowledge!
So predictable! Yes. I have been saying this forever! Theoretical Physics is extremely tenuous physics.
I look forward to this Festival every year.
Pure gold!
If it takes billions of years for the light/image of far away objects in the universe to reach earth then how do we know of any of that stuff is even still there? We could just be looking back in history instead of what is presently there today. I just wonder if we had the ability to travel faster than the speed of light when it would be that the images we see through our telescopes would fade away and we would see the reality of what actually exists there today.
We don&#39;t know.  Its all a snap shot in time.
If our galaxy was the size of the USA then our sun would be the size of a red blood cell.
I am made uneasy by watching this discussion. There appears an increasing distance between the lofty ideals of these minds and the leaden opportunists who lead us. Just saying.
Huge money, the truth is no benefit more science fiction.
I wanted to say thank you for your presentation. You do a great job of making these topics accessible, and approachable to non-scientest. On multiple occasions I&#39;ve hurd you be self deprecating. Also on multiple occasions I&#39;ve hurd you express a sincere invitation for anyone to consider the data. You do a great job of interpolating the shop talk of academics and literally bringing it down to earth. I really think that you are opening doors to future generations of scientists by making it more accessible. Thank you, to you and everyone behind the scenes who helps you.
How is any of this supposed to help mankind?
How are you helping mankind?
What a treat!
I feel maybe our model of the universe is wrong and the big bang was a white hole, there was galaxies already forming when the repulsive force of the white hole has only just stopped 13 billion years ago and the universe is probably trillions of years old 😂
Awesome, just one critism. The white backgrounds on the streams are way to bright, especially on a big screen tv. Hurts my eyes to be honest and is not nice to watch
Stop sucking up on Brian .. he’s doing a great job without it
Correction; Science
Some 30 years ago when I was reading science, I read an article on the early universe, detailing how there were two models, at that time, I really Galaxy formation. One was the bottom up. Model were the first object to form with it we’re stars, and they would aggregate into clusters in the clusters would grow in the galaxies. The other, competing, model was the top down model, which Argued that early galaxies formed as one object initially, rapidly accumulating mass from the surrounding, and burns to form a galaxy sized mass, which then differentiated into stars. Considering the fact that at the time of the early universe, the universe itself was much smaller and extent, and therefore much denser, it seems logical that galaxy and star formation would proceed rapidly. The recent web findings showing massive galaxies formed early on, seems to support the top down model. What is the current consensus in this regard?
That feeling when the smartest guys on this planet tell you stories.... I love this channel.
Never ceases to amaze. Extraordinary!
The ultimate answer;  Creation by God.
But not any god.  Just the one you were raised with.  Hilarious
Could the Avogadro number/ the mole be applied to space ?
It was my pleasure to be on this show with Brian Greene
Why can&#39;t you just say how good the image is? it&#39;s not been posted online yet, the majority of the earths population isn&#39;t paying attention to this type of news. They are concerned with the kardashisms or whatever they&#39;re called.
Hmm beyond Neptune?   I know it is hard to believe and you can call me crazy.   But that’s where we are going to find exotic life forms, mostly in asteroid belt , some day.  Mark my word.
Bring the orbs back bouncing around during intro.
JWST deep field is gonna be a BIG deal
Thanks to Brian Greene for asking critical and good questions.. This is just beautiful. BEYOND beautiful!!!.
I’m thinking that the early universe was in a much smaller space, so it makes sense to me (an absolute novice) that stars and galaxies would form and evolve much quicker.
Thanks to Brian Greene for asking critical and good questions.
Habitable zone???...it might be a joke these days Europa is not in the habitable zone as well as enceladus...and it&#39;s possible that live exist under the ice crust...
why in an expanding universe would it be unusual that the early universe be expanding slower than the later part?
They don&#39;t know... But additional funding, time and tools might uncover some new information.<br><br>Meanwhile creating a material to fill potholes that will last more than 3 months still eludes us.
World woke up Festival
i just lost all respect for this guy &amp; NIEL Tyson
this guy either works for the cia or is a member of the nwo criminal cabal syndicate or he&#39;s dumb as f not to recognize trump is saving humanity stopping the cabals agenda to over throw the world..
You’ve fallen for trumps ploy. Sad. He’s a billionaire con man. If you can’t see that, I have no sympathy.
@DaytonWhite96  a billionaire that&#39;s not blind and knows the deep states end game plan .. u think he wants to loose all his crap ?
Surat No 3 : سورة آل عمران - Ayat No 190 <br><br>اِنَّ فِیۡ خَلۡقِ السَّمٰوٰتِ وَ الۡاَرۡضِ وَ اخۡتِلَافِ الَّیۡلِ وَ النَّہَارِ لَاٰیٰتٍ  لِّاُولِی الۡاَلۡبَابِ ﴿۱۹۰﴾ۚ  ۙ<br><br> Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding.
What if in the same way a planetary system forms from the remains of a star, galaxies formed from the remains of super giant early stars which created the super massive black holes in the centre of galaxies? Then again for all we know we&#39;re in a black hole right now...
They are simply tryong to justify the billions they stole from you. This like the super collider results are made up bs.
World science festival is the best forum I&#39;ve come across. Following it for years. Always more to learn and presented in a wonderful way. Love the way the learned people generously share the knowledge. Thank you WSF. Thank you Brian Greene.
Yeah, this video was stellar😊
&quot;its like building cathedrals&quot; i truly appreciate all involved...keep pushing us forward
Thanks Brain for such discussions. I like this discussion which I am still watching at around 33 minutes. I also had the change to watch the talk about  James WEBB few days before it was launched.<br>@just have minor question on the ring images. Do they always appear in that (not sure how to say in English ... let me us horizontal shape) horizontal like shape or is there a vertical like shape straight to our view dimensions or angle which are crossing those laying ring-shape. E.g. close shape like the way we draw our longitude and latitude lines our the equator which are imaginary while these are real objects&#39; shape appearing in such circles. I mean are they one side circles or 2 intersecting like circles?<br><br>The reason I am asking for such data is that I am thinking in space as without-directions or dimensions as a whole-as-space.
I am glad they finally got it off the ground. I&#39;d been waiting 20 years. I only wish I had another 20 in me for it.
So nobody is going to talk about his voice, okay
The assumptions of the origins of the universe are wrong but intellectual mathematical physics are developed from the observing human collective brain that has followed a path of scientific egos whose egos compartmentalize the enormous existence of our infinite reality into their devoted field of supposed objective meaning into a finite certainty contained within their mortal and infinitesimally brief existence swallowed in an eternal ocean.
The Universe has no beginning or end. Their was no Big Bang Period.
Evidence?
FAKE

Brilliant minds make the world a beautiful place.
Now imagine where we&#39;d be if JWST had launched a decade ago like it was supposed to.
In general if humanity  could stop wars and give those funds to science... So sad world we live in ;(

I absolutely love that image of Neptune. Its awesome! JWST is a true gift to science.
If I didn’t know better I’d think this is the RNC. So many white people! But wait, the scientific community is mostly liberal? Huh…
The RNC is anti-science, so this looks nothing like it. 20 years ago, there wouldn&#39;t have been any women on this panel. We are definitely progressing, and I am so happy to see it!
@@mygirldarby20 years ago there wouldn’t have been this panel period because there wasn’t JWST so I don’t know what your point is. Oh by the way, you have completely misses the point, even with the help of a space telescope! Lol

That was great. Thankyou ❤
Brian Greene lost a little credibility with me by showing he is infected with TDS, Trump derangement syndrome. They just can&#39;t help themselves.
Can JWST be used to find ort cloud objects ?
According to John Mather (one of the panelists here), &quot;Oort Cloud objects are far too faint, even for JWST, unless we get extremely lucky.&quot;
Is the GWB just God’s Heartbeat?
Lmao nope.

Nostalgically, as a boomer science fiction fan,<br>I feel a small ache that Isaac Asimov can&#39;t share these new discoveries<br>with us; there would be many others, but his books, the fiction buoyed <br>by the science, still hold a very cherished claim on my not-so-rigorous <br>sensibilities.

So the ones from Australia and New Zealand made the trip to NY but the Americans couldn&#39;t be bothered? What&#39;s up with that?
There are TWO editions of the World Science Festival, in New York and in Brisbane, Australia. This particular show was shot in Brisbane in March 2023. The New York festival will take place in September.  Hope to see you there!
neptune’s rings are just WOW and now on demand (can be seen anytime) 💃🥳😊
They will hang onto that paradigm for dear life no matter how many problems/contradictions. Thomas Kuhn was correct.
Keep your political biases away from science, thanks.
Exactly. Every time Prof Green must show his political opinions. Sciece is on the best in distance to Zeitgeist phänomena. He should look for the famous principles of war propaganda. The are scientific prooven.
Benjamin wants to be a Rock Star. <br>But Michele is the one who should have been a singer🎶

He lost me at cold dark matter
already back ground gravitational waves permeating the universe have been found. More likely &quot;big bang&quot; event waves have caused matter to clutter, like dust in my house gathers in heaps caused by air streams and me moving about.
Ahhh, the James Webb Space Telescope is an AMERICAN product chump… and don’t forget it. It’s not a “world product” it’s pure American ingenuity.
The JWST involved over 300 universities, companies and organizations around the world across 15 different countries. It is not an exclusively American product any more than you are an intellectual.
Do your homework!  13 other countries contributed to the design, engineering and construction of the JWST.  Not Knocking the good old USA - but please............give credit where and when it is due.
They do a good job of describing how fuzzy some of these calculations and hypothesis are....so many variables at play, and it&#39;s worth reminding ourselves we&#39;re still coming to terms with how far away Betelgeuse is with any solid accuracy, a star quite nearby.  The &quot;cold dark matter&quot; we&#39;re so excited to assume is one of the missing pieces to our observation vs. physics has never been observed, not &quot;dark&quot; as much as completely indetectable and a bookmark for future discovery along with &quot;dark energy&quot; which is just a way of saying we don&#39;t know what the force is that dictates the expansion in our observations.  Like dating human history using ancient pottery, things shift as our understanding changes.  I feel like good cosmologists and experts will constantly remind us of these fuzzy edges and unknowns.
Great presentation.
Thank you Brian Greene for these interviews about JWT and its finds. The effort you made with questions, etc … you’re the best🙏
Trump 2024 🌍✌
IKR.  This presentation was fine, until BG decided to throw out a bizarre comment about Trump.
Excellent ! A pleasure to watch, a demonstration of how entertaining Science can be presented.<br>My sincere thanks to Brian, the guests, and the whole production team.
I love the habitable world concept because it give as an apportunity new working place for mining agriculture construction by using a new kind of rover I have been working on to be universal usable in every task of human ...thanks I appreciate the great work of the web telescope engineers and designer and scientists as a whole..thanks..
Amazing talk! •° Spoil the beans already! °•😂 Worth every minute of our time.
Brian I have been fortunate enough to watch WSF for many years now: thank you! This presentation is among the best, Im a Kiwi but Michele&#39;s passion &amp; communication is wonderful.
This was an excellent program that was both informative and excited the imagination. <br>All the guests were phenomenal; however I must say that Michelle Bannister’s enthusiasm radiates brings me a joy I rarely feel these days. She seems so delighted to be doing what she does, and is very effective at serving the viewer with digestible bits of her experiences that are still contain enough elation to be pleasantly intoxicating.

It is the awareness of some of the amazing things that science will be investigating,  but not for some time,  that I find to be the biggest misery that comes with being cognizant of our mortality. <br><br>There are so many fascinating discoveries that will change how we understand our universe,  and it&#39;s such a bummer to know that current advances in technology, which are already rapidly expanding our view,   guarantees there&#39;ll be so much,  that I would love to learn about,  that&#39;ll happen after I have shuffled off this mortal coil.
My feeling is black holes are just an expression of a fifth spatial dimensional direction. Traveling towards a black hole would seem like you are getting closer to it as the environment shifts around you to resemble normal universe, but it wouldn&#39;t get any closer. Just like, traveling towards SPACE from EARTH is directionally UP.<br><br>James Webb images in the early galaxy inspired this thought.<br><br>Warping of spacetime affects our observations, and we mistake that for reality. If a black hole bends spacetime towards a singularity, time also bends around it.<br><br>Black holes are likely just convex energies matching the universal concave.

I don’t understand why he is always bringing Trump into a scientific discussion.  I think he has TDS.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=4857">1:20:57</a> THIS lol. I&#39;m proud to be a democrat because democrats are statistically more likely to be highly educated compared to Trumpie republicans. It&#39;s not a coincidence. Democrats are more educated, we recognize science(for example on the topic of gender), &amp;we view all humans as equal🤍
We can now know beforehand whether a possibly habitable planet has a housefly problem.
As I&#39;ve said before and will continue to say, the image at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=456">7:36</a> is NOT of gravitational lensing (at least not wholly). The dead give-away (and what should be obvious to anyone who fundamentally understands gravity) is the arc signatures and the presumptive focal center of mass for each definable arc representation given the claim of gravitational lensing.<br>It wouldn&#39;t be a stretch to suggest that if there is 5 baryons per cubic yard of space in one area and 2 baryons per cubic yard of space in another area on average (for example), that these minimal quantities of actual matter could not be detected at billions of light years distance and the interface areas between these dissimilar regions could be regions where light is channeled in another direction. Thus, a type of refraction (redirection we don&#39;t yet understand, possibly electro-magnetic, static polarization, quantum drag, muon interaction, etc.?).
Some media mention there are areas of the universe we can no longer see due to the expansion of the universe having caused them to be moving away from our region of space faster than the speed of light.   Other media, as this video does, speculate about being able to observe the earliest stars in the universe.  <br><br>I’ve always found it difficult to reconcile those two concepts.  If we can’t see to the outer edges of the universe, how can we be sure we are estimating the age of the universe with any precision?  Maybe that’s inherent in the math somehow, but I keep hoping someone will provide a clear explanation one of these days.
We are living in an age where the Universe has not yet expanded at a rate where we are unable to make observations near the beginning of the Universe. That time will come so we are fortunate to be living in this window of time.
@@mikotagayuna8494 Miko, I appreciate you replying.  I enjoy reading about astronomy and cosmology, but I also find them to be pretty complex and math-intensive subjects once you start getting beyond the bounds of what I think is a typical layman’s understanding.<br><br>The Wikipedia entry for Observable Universe notes that the inflationary theory of Guth, et al. “suggest that at present the entire universe&#39;s size is at least 1.5×1034 light-years—at least 3×1023 times the radius of the observable universe”.  It’s those kind of statements that contribute to my current confusion or misunderstanding.  Still, I enjoy learning about it and I’m a big fan of the World Science videos for their work to communicate science to the masses.
That’s if the Big Bang cosmology holds up.
@@LesterWayneDobos Certainly.  But I understand it to be one of the major theories in cosmological evolution and mentioned it to clarify my initial comment regarding the &quot;observable&quot; universe.
@@kevinc1956 Cosmology crosses my mind time to time.  The early galaxies being 10x size of milky way hadn&#39;t the time to form so huge according to big bang timeframe.  I have the assumption that beyond that is an infinite universe, not one of potential decay, but that is more of a philosophical discussion.

I get red shift. BUT. We all now know that light can be slowed by gravity. People keep telling me the speed of light is constant. The same people that argue for dark matter. The same people that tell me gravity is constant and a weak force. Yet in recent years the theoretical black hole is now proven. The fact that gravity has a wave function is now proven. Waves have variable intensity and because they are waves, variable frequency. My point is the energetic historical galaxies would have been massively gravity intensive on a wave spectrum. We should surely not judge the age of anything based on the speed of light when we cannot measure the effects of gravity outside our frame of reference. People also tell me that Newtons laws and General relativity accurately predict the motion of large objects we observe. No they dont. Newtons laws fall down when observing anything outside our &quot;solar system&quot; frame of reference. General relativity starts to break down when observing anything that is singular, be it super massive or quanta in nature. Im not sure we can ever truly understand the age and size of our universe without knowing which gravitational wave events took place, where, when and how big!!!
It&#39;s not slowed by gravity... It is bent to follow the gravity curve which is a longer path than a direct line.
Whatever happened, the Big Bang was super powerful. It’s typing this. Crazy

I have a question for the astrophysicists. Can we detect planets orbiting a star which has the rotational axis of the system pointed directly at the Earth? If not, how much does this limited the detection of planets?
The transit method is not the only method used to detect planets. Astronomers can also look for wobbling as a result of a planet&#39;s radial velocity as well as the bending of the star&#39;s light due to effect of a planet&#39;s gravitation.
@@mikotagayuna8494 Thanks for the reply. I had heard of the wobble detection method but forgot it. Wobble detection must be very difficult due to the size of the movement. I can&#39;t imagine how much the Sun moves in response to Jupiter&#39;s orbit but to detect that wobble at a distance of lightyears is mind blowing. Cheers.
I would guess , around a million people , working together , for a common goal the JWT......what if humanity , did the same.....? .
Wise words, keep spreading.
The advances in our knowledge of the universe since JWST became functional is nothing less than mind blowing. There is life on other planets, the only unknown is how much, there is probably intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy, again the only unknown is frequency.<br>As a 67yo one minor regret is that I may not live long enough to know for sure that life has been discovered on other planets or that intelligent life has been discovered elsewhere.
My guess is that we&#39;ll have a colony on Mars sooner than the life question is definitively answered...if it ever is.<br>I&#39;m in the same boat as you, only a few years further along life&#39;s journey.  At least we have eclipsed the entire history of humans in space to this point.
According to many NDE&#39;s I&#39;ve heard, it may be that we will know all after life here. If we live to see life found on other planets, that will be awesome, but if we then die and no longer exist and our awareness is gone, what&#39;s the point in knowing anything anyway? It&#39;s only a moment in time, a blip in eternity, and seems meaningless in the bigger picture if we don&#39;t carry our awareness beyond our physical life. Knowledge, memories, insight...none of it matters if it is extinguished after a physical lifetime. It would be pretty worthless. I guess it can be passed to living humans to advance things but eventually our sun will destroy our planet, the universe will expand, it will likely die and there will be no trace of our physical life, and no evidence we even existed.
​@@mygirldarby You&#39;re right. I have thought about this exact point. What&#39;s the point of knowing anything anyway? I don&#39;t know of any way of determining the answer to this for sure. But just because we can imagine the question, ie why are we conscious, is not an argument in support of the convenient answer, which is, yes because we are conscious our life must have meaning. The alternative answer is just as likely. It&#39;s 7AM and 15 deg C, what a bloody awful time to consider the question.
​​@@mayflowerlash11ifficult to determine what your actually pondering, but if you think life has meaning other than what you imbue it with, then I guess you&#39;re still very young; meaning is a philosophical question, not a scientific one; the inability to cope with my answer is the crutch called religion.<br><br>Consciousness allows you to ask that question, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a useful question, except perhaps at parties to get chats going with ppl you want to hook up with.
Curious to know if anyone here KNOWS that there&#39;s life on other planets, in or out of our solar system.  Please tell me that you&#39;re not waiting for disclosure from government
Having Brian Greene ask questions that we are not allowed to ask, seems politically biased.
Gotta say, I can&#39;t imagine what questions we are not allowed to ask.

Right?! Have you seen HiRise stereo imagery yet? (In vr)
Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis<br> <br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of mass?  Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the “fabric” of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point?<br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn’t expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn’t require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it…
Good point 👉
I don&#39;t believe in your imprint theory.  It&#39;s not as simple as a piece of metal bent and left that way.
Excellent! I can&#39;t wait to see the new discoveries.
As great as JWST is, it&#39;s not really an investment for humanity&#39;s survival.  <br>Pretty sad really.  Who&#39;s working on a NOBEL prize for ending war, or homelessness, or disease.  Seriously.
Incroyable
Brian, they will find within the next 24 months that there is no expanding universe. We may also learn that galaxies farthest away from us are actually smaller not larger. We will learn that the mass of &quot;things&quot; closer to us are larger than the mass farther away. This is why we THINK far-away galaxies that appear larger because we are comparing the mass of close items to have the same mass as the same items farther away. Items farther away are actually &quot;compressed&quot; the farther away it is. Imagine a fish that lives its entire life at the bottom of a deep ocean. There it is in equilibrium. A fisherman hooks one of them and pulls it to the surface where it bloats and eyes pop out of its head. It was compressed and then depressurized. This is the far universe.
So far the Best explanation of JWST
Yes - and why IR was so important.

Bigger telescopes in 5 years on Starship?  I guess you work in pr for SpaceX.  That or you are a delusional Elon fanboy/girl.  Webb took 30 years to build.

I have a question, what if the universe was created simultaneously and set into motion. If this is the case then when we look at other galaxies from great distance&#39;s could it be that we are not looking back to the beginning but rather at a gallexy that is just so far away that it&#39;s light has red shifted simply because of it&#39;s distance. This would imply that the universe does not have an age at least one that we can comprehen as we cannot gauge it&#39;s size, depth, width, or understand all of it&#39;s intricate parts. This view has validity and reliability that perhaps could serve the scientific method of observation.

The passage of time is entirely derived from the movement of energy. Eliminate energy and there is no time. As the rate of the movement of energy is limited to the speed of light, the passage of time is metered by the speed of light, at least in the open Universe. The fact that humans were not around in the early universe, this does not mean that there was no time. The passage of energy through an unconscious universe was vital to the development of the kind of Universe that could support life and humans. The early Universe was busily making the heavy elements and dispersing them around space as dust clouds and chunks of minerals metals and water to make our world possible right here where we live,….now. I love the biological expression “what doesn’t kill you, will evolve and try again”, and this likely means that it won’t be an expanding sun that ends our time, it will be life itself. <br>This should help you see that there is no time travel. What is real is the now. We can predict certain aspects of the future and prepare for them mostly where the events prepared for are operating at sub light speed.

&quot;Meaning&quot; is made up and only exists after nature is through with us.  We are evolutionarily programed to live long enough to procreate and nurture our offspring until they are independent.  At that point we are totally useless, just hanging around waiting to die of something.  So we invent some vague &quot;meaning&quot; ONLY to justify our desire to live beyond our purpose.

This is a good interview, not only Brian is brilant, but Faith salie is very well prepared,
It is accurate to assert that complex systems, such as weather patterns and human behavior, are not deterministic. This is due to the intricate interplay of numerous processes, even though these do not necessarily involve true free will. Particularly in highly intelligent beings, like humans or potentially future AI (should development continue), there is a manifestation of behavior that closely resembles free will. Delving deeper into this argument, one might question whether highly free-will-like behavior is equivalent to true free will. In my opinion, it is not. However, what is certain is that such behavior is decidedly non-deterministic. This represents a partial triumph over the concept of determinism.

🖐️✋🖖🤟🤘✌️🤞🤙🤌 alot of hand moves 🐒🕺
What an insightful and informative discussion this was with you two.  Thank you both!
It goes without saying that Brian Greene is a physics/science gem. I didn&#39;t know who Faith Salie was before this inteveriew but she KILLS IT. Well done both of you.
great show
Once you build your reputation as a great physicist, any bullshit you utter becomes a LAW OF NATURE.
Semaphore Alert! 👺
Apoptosis is the Big Bang lol
Gave me chills
Our fragile and fleeting existence bears the imprint of the extraordinary—a rarity that provides meaning to the fragility of life. Within this lack of self-awareness, the seeds of gratitude and the substance of what we love are hidden.<br><br>Do we attempt to leave a permanent mark on the stars in this situation, or are we merely cosmic imprints of celestial storylines yet to be deciphered?<br>&quot;We are ephemeral, we are evanescent, yet our moment is rare and extraordinary—a recognition that allows us to make life&#39;s impermanence and the scarcity of self-reflexive awareness the basis for value and a foundation of gratitude.&quot; <br>Until the End of Time <br>Mind, Matter, and the Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe<br>Brian Greene
@user-kw8zj9zm5g<br>7 minutes ago (edited)<br>@user-kw8zjizm5g<br>from Byron vyron as victor victor<br>Its time to let my truth out and proof with evidence science proof soon, and that there is something else with us on planet earth, and it has family and friends around the globe and its the singularity of the universe life structure and its conscious and alive and I call it God, Light philosophy the very thing that made life on earth, and yes its the truth to settle your minds forever eternal in unity but it also favours the 2 sides of life and special life ethos
Dr. Greene, many thanks for your efforts! If I may ask a question...<br>In  Phys. Rev. 160, 1113 (1967) Bryce DeWitt, as well as John A.Wheeler in &quot;Relativity, Groups and Topology&quot; (1968) - they have developed the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a wave function of the Universe. Above all, they came to a conclusion that (in the case of so called &#39;mini-superspace&#39;) the wave function (a.k.a. amplitude of probability) does not depend on time. Well, but this conclusion is in conflict with our &#39;daily&#39; experience that universe in fact is changing with time. Thus, it follows that Universe (including US in it) does not change, and time does not exist, while We, the Observer, experience time within it and do observe the change... <br>Probably as laity in theoretical physics I am mistaken with this interpretation, but could you please give your interpretation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for wave function of the Universe. Thank you
Entropy is the measure of disorder and it always increases ... then why and how there was the &quot;order&quot; before ?
History tell&#39;s us we have had a polor shift. Did a compos point south or is the magnetic field always point to the north
This video is equal parts informative and beautiful, and I think that&#39;s largely a reflection of the 2 humans sharing the stage. Faith and Brian seem to complement each other perfectly... literally and figuratively. My only complaint is this: TOO SHORT. I would happily spend several more hours with these people. Just wonderful.

This is so awesome.  Here is a very intelligent guest having a civil discussion with a very intelligent interviewer. She asks a (that is just one) coherent question then stops talking and lets him answer. She listens patiently then when he is done speaking asks another question.  This is so sadly unusual these days.
It&#39;s that place beyond numbers...it becomes theory and not 3d anymore....
Eventually all math turns into theory and explores the undescribable....
According to Mario Livio we can predict the age of the Universe much more accuratelty than the age of a Human.
I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD QUESTIONS THE SAME WAY AS BRIAN HAS,WHY ARE WE HERE?,THE EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF LOVE,FEEL,HATE,COMUNICATE EACH OTHER,ETC,AND WHY ARE WE COSNCIOUS BEINGS? ETC ETC;AND I WAS ASKING THE WRONG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR  ANSWERS WERE SOMETHING LIKE:DON&#39;T ASK DUMB QUESTIONS OR HOW SILLY ARE YOU ASKING THOSE THINGS,AND FINALLY I&#39;VE FOUND PEOPLE LIKE BRIAN GREENE,ELON MUSK,LEX FRIDMAN,ETC,PEOPLE WHO HAS THE SAME QUESTIONS AS ME AND BESIDES SUPER SMART PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS,THIS IS &quot;AMAZING&quot;!!👍👍👍👍
It is so naive to state that there is no meaning in the universe while at the same time stating that it&#39;s just particles obeying the LAW! It seems that we are too anthropic to prove god or teleology doesn&#39;t exist, as we are too anthropic to prove it does.
I am sold on the book! Great video!
Groovy 🎉
The idea of God is the biggest and strongest arbitrary foundation laid down by humans in order to propel humanity forward in time. The creation of God by humans was absolute necessity of time.
I think my life seems like a puzzle that continues to unravel with uncanny coincidences!❤❤❤❤❤❤maybe like string🦋🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
He&#39;s wrong about free will. He doesn&#39;t account for our Devine spirit, which is not just particle motion.
If randomness exist, just like quantum mechanics predicts, and our consciosness is governed by the quantum theory then there must be some destiny thats beyond our mathematical models and that destiny is our free will; free of every previous knowlege.
She&#39;s a really terrific interviewer. She clearly read the book, has cogent questions, and articulates them well.
I have just started listening to the audio version of his book, narrated by Brian Greene himself. What a wonderful, thought provoking journey it is proving to be. I respect this man for his intelligence, dedication, and his storytelling abilities to make the mind staggering information of quantum physics understandable to one (me) who has no scientific background but does have a curiosity. Thank you, Dr. Greene. And Thank you, Faith Sallie for this program.
wow!!!
Time is a measuring device, just like a tap measurer measures the length of a board. Time is used to measure life and existence. time is just a form of explaining how things come and go.
I feel similar to the way Brian did about doing physics going through some dark moments or a tough portion of life. Thank You Dr. Greene, you will always be a motivation for me in life.

As an analogy, using Light as Will, under the current laws of physics, Will is both free and deterministic😌
Brian green is the absolute best at helping regular people understand deep physics topics. He knows how to explain without dumbing it down. Genius.

i felt the univerce after listing to him
I have a question for Mr. Greene.  Does the universe knows it exists.
We are already aware of this information. It has been reiterated hundreds of times. Unless there are new scientific breakthroughs, no one will pay attention to these repetitions in the near future.
Excellent. One of the best conversations about physics and meaning I have watched
Well said Brian Greene.
It&#39;d be happier if the interviewer gave more appreciations to Brian&#39;s brilliant self-reflections instead of talking about her kid stories multiple times.
I&#39;ll never get over what an amazing speaker he is on subjects thats borderline impossible to comprehend for a lot of people
Sounds too much like a preacher to me.
I am so so angry like volcano wants to erupt
Sorry my friend brian
Human r so excited when dey see for the first time and keep on pushing how it works, but they forget , how  and how my feelings is
Some people say ai is dangerous,  now answer me now who’s the problem here
Then tell me who is the main problem here, human or AI,? Ansy me

Amazing
The answer to Life , the Universe &amp; Everything = Greene
F-
I love the way Bryan Greene explains the complexity of our universe in a easy to understand phrases. You are the best!
loud lady
The interviewer, Faith Salie, is such a Manhattanite. Good fun, folks!
<i>&quot;Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity helped us to understand gravity&quot;</i> OH really then what about Karl Swarzschild&#39;s answer to Einstein in 1917?<br><br>BIG BANG Gravity Problem:<br>1.	Big Bang assumes energy and matter from nothing in a quantum singularity or fluctuation<br>2.	The density is quoted variously as extreme to infinite<br>3.	The total mass of the universe curves space and shapes the universes destiny<br>4.	Black Holes have an escape velocity at their event horizon equal to the speed of light<br>5.	The size of a Black Hole is measured by its mass which gives the diameter of the event horizon<br>6.	The mass of the universe is ~1e80 protons = 6.7e53 Kg<br>7.	The formula for escape velocity = (2GM/r)^0.5 Therefore r = 2GM/v^2<br>8.	Given M = 6.7e53 Kg and v = 3e8 m/sec therefore Dia = 2.r = 52.5 billion light yrs<br>9.	The universe cannot at any time have been smaller than 52.5 billion light yrs in diameter<br>10.	This is called the Schwarzschild&#39;s Radius of any mass and is well known<br>11.	Hence the matter in the universe can only have been created <b>after the expansion of space..</b><br><b>The Big Bang is falsified as a violation of the law of gravity! Q.E.D.</b><br><br>This is uniquely consistent with the Genesis account of creation of stars on day 4 after the expansion of space. Also <i>&quot;Let there be light.&quot;</i> on day 1 explains the uniform CMBR being a burst of photon energy with no mass.
If as he says <i>&quot;the truths of math will never change&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;once you prove a theorem in mathematics it stands forever&quot;</i> we know we did not invent it we only discovered it. Someone else <i>&quot;invented&quot;</i> it actually!
<b>Maths</b> <i>&quot;something we invent don&#39;t discover&quot;</i> If mathematics did not have rules that would sound ok. But the fact math has very specific rules tells us; <b>NO</b> we did not <b>invent</b> it we discovered it. It is one of the things that makes the universe understandable and one of the reasons we were designed to be able to understand it and give proper recognition to God who both designed and created it.
She is wearing a tablecloth, lol
I think this lady is a nut job.  Could she push his book any more than she did. OMG ....how nauseous.<br>And this guy is nothing more than a philosophical mathematician.
Such an intelligent man ,yet so wrong in the Free Will part. No, Vitalism has not been debunked by explaining away life ( which hasn&#39;t  happened anyway).There are mountains of evidence that science can&#39;t explain and ,in its modern reductionist version, never will.
Why is she screaming?
Watching this guy , my brain struggles to keep up. Is it better to live life in ignorance of the greater things we cannot control or just let these guys get on with it? How does he sleep at night with all these questions. ❤
Every one here for brian wile i am here wishing i was faiths chair.
its still an unexplained gap - the experience of qualia is not evident in physics so perhaps a meta law is needed
About a year ago, I bought a bookshelf for my living room that really tied the room together. I had 5 shelves, and I filled one with my fiction books, and the bottom with my college books. I just ordered Brian&#39;s book here and am about to clear the random stuff I have on another shelf, and start my new nonfiction section. It will be here wednesday. I gotta read it first so that section will wait.
I love this man&#39;s knowledge when I realized that the Planet Earth does not need our presence at any level
great to have people like him!
10 second : the entire year = 1: 3,153,600. This is the difference between $1 and $3,153,600. A huge difference but I can comprehend and I can set plan to earn that amount in my lifetime. The entire history of universe is human comprehensible.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=319">5:19</a> I love that about math and physics!
Random blobs of molecules trying to articulate the meaning of all this randomness.
Are higher dimensions earlier in origination than lower ones? If so I could imagine that since the earth kind of seems more roundy than the flatyness of the universe that maybe the earth type of time is different dimensionally than the universal type of time.
Amazing interview!! Best in absolute!

The Universe sounds so cool!  I must visit it come day.
I am perplexed, and indeed frustrated, that so many scientists choose to disregard Roger Penrose&#39;s rigorous demonstration that &quot;understanding&quot; must be non-algorithmic in character. Even if we speculate, with Brian Greene, that consciousness refers to             &quot;nothing but&quot; the working of some notionally complex procedure or system, then Penrose has shown that this supposition is by no means justified. (ie in terms of the procedure itself). It also follows that we may have genuine free-will, somehow associated with the workings of the brain, even though this principle is not understandable either as a deterministic or as a random process.
Euclid wrote the first scientific treatise on vision. In his <i>Optika,</i> we already find a decided emphasis on the traditional geometric aspects of the subject. Euclid contributed to our story in another important way. The seeming certainty and clarity of his <i>Elements</i> inspired Galileo, Newton, and Descartes in their drive toward a mathematical account of nature. Akin to the Greeks, they also sought to anchor their work in certainty. Now, unlike color and sound, the spatial and temporal dimensions of experience were seen to have an agreeable constancy or invariance to them — and then, we have long had measuring sticks and clocks to measure space and time, so that helped them along immeasurably.<br><br>Today, we have accurate ways of measuring color and sound, but as yet no very good geometrical understanding of these facets of nature. We do know, however, that the spatial and temporal dimensions of things change with relative motion — as do color and sound when they Doppler in or out, shifting toward the red or blue, depending.<br><br>We also know that colors and sounds are <i>invariant</i> or <i>symmetric</i> when under the same conditions, allowing us to engineer color TVs, computer monitors, as well as all the gadgets we have nowadays for reproducing sound. And then, as we shall see, we now know that symmetry governs everything going on in the universe, which is kind of interesting.<br><br>A second important thread can be traced back to antiquity. Greek atomism gave rise to the persistent notion that colors and sounds exist only in the mind, or as matters of opinion — a dogma which continues to dominate scientific thinking today. Again, many intelligent people, Nobel laureates among them, will hasten to tell you that color is just the frequency of light. This nonsense gets repeated so often, it is of a piece with what “everyone knows.” (Try to discover who figured this out, however, and when, and where, and how that is supposed to make any sense, and good luck to you.) <br><br>The truth is that color has never been successfully incorporated into the body of science. Yet we routinely read in textbooks on quantum theory that the wave function contains, in principle, all that we can know about a physical thing. The author of the wave function clearly disagreed, however. <br><br>When not dabbling in quantum theory, Schrödinger thought a lot about color:<br><br> &quot;If you ask a physicist what is his idea of yellow light, he will tell you that it is transversal electromagnetic waves of wavelength in the neighborhood of 590 millimicrons. If you ask him: But where does yellow come in? he will say: In my picture not at all, but these kinds of vibrations, when they hit the retina of a healthy eye, give the person whose eye it is the sensation of yellow.&quot;<br><br>So we have color and sound and the other &#39;secondary qualities&#39; of Locke. We experience them all the time, in predictable, quantifiable correlations with &quot;physical&quot; things. Where in the formulations of physics might we fit these additional elements of reality?
WOW Fantastic Video!!! Thank you Brian Greene and Faith for your fabulous interaction.
Definitely science is another religion but a very simplistic and dehumanized one...
My brain completely changed when i read michio kakus hyperspace book (made before i was born, 1990, yet people dont even understand any of einstines idias yet hahaha)<br>He doesn&#39;t even say the word dimension. I do and everone gets confused and i go down rabbit holes. It&#39;s really tough talking about science because I&#39;m so far ahead of everyone else. And all a them, he and michio kaku, me, everyone. But again, they never go down the rabbit hole, even though that&#39;s the monster not only in the closet, but also under the bed and all darkness out side in night, even when you turn the lights off. You have to address it. This dark matter is string theory. Its time and space, and we even have some math equations and laws, yet they are never talked about. There&#39;s so much, ... and he even kinda leans tord without a question, and answer is worthless. If you skip to the end of our book, everybody dies. Boaring.<br>The only religion worth teaching is string theory because particals are transdimensional.<br><br>But he says all there is is laws of physics and particals wiggling till they die. Yea being one with nature is cool, but if you cant get into that, get into what i say, be one with dimensions. Be one with string theory. They will all pass on. What makes our molecules are tied to us transdimensionaly, and then they all go away when time doesn&#39;t matter anymore. They go up a dimension. Time is a dimension.<br>Its more than just death, and its not religion. I believe in super string theory. Its been around for almost twice I&#39;ve been alive for. One day more people will be like me. I&#39;ve lived a tough life and nobody knows or cares, but i believe in something better than anybody else. In other words, get on my level bro.<br>Theres more forces of nature in lower dimensions. The more forces of nature are combined with gravity in higher dimensions. He even wrote that in his book, but again, thats not &quot;in sceen&quot; its not what the cool cats do. Therefore all u can do is buy his book and monitize knolage.
I sense some game with Brian Greene. He seems to have charmed the lovely Red head 😉😉😉 you go brain
We Live Now - Learning from the Past Hoping for a Future.
she interjects far too much
Growing up, I Never had somebody to look up to but Brian Green has become one of very few select that I do listen to and appreciate. I was lucky enough to ask him a question in Sydney two months back and it was an honour to do so. Thank you for keeping me interested in science and space. Your influence has made its way to the philosophy that I have been adopting while doing my PhD
Free will is not illusory.
How ludicrous, thought will come to an end? 😂😂😂
Entropy is relative.
Time exists because matter exists. But God is not matter,  God created matter. Time began when God created the universe. Before that God was simply existing. Since there was no matter, and because God does not change,  time had no existence and therefore no meaning, no relation to him.   Even now time has no relation to God, he is outside of time, even though time and matter exist.
The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by hands. And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives men life and breath and everything else.
He is a worthy successor of dr. Carl Sagan.
Brian Greene is my source for time space and what not!   You keep me coming back to you dear Sir!  Thank you!
This interviewer is unbearable
The battle/coexistence between entropy and evolution sounds a lot like the coexistence of dark energy and gravity.
Wish i could Mute that stupid girl 🙄
Can this women stop gawking over him and just interview him.. lol
Another great session by Brian Greene! 👏
Very helpful to better understand time and life. Gratefully, thx  to both.  👌💜🌹
OK, I understood the sun to blame for thermonuclear destruction and we have no news about the war in Ukraine
I love science but the more I learn about the universe the more my faith is reinforced in the teachings of the Bhagaved gita. No religious scripture goes into the science of the universe like the Bhagaved gita. And the mathematical calculation for the age of the universe was first written thousands of years ago in the Bhagaved gita. Even Carl Sagan admitted that.
Yes, Very Thought Provoking.
His brother.....consiousness is fundamental reality.....In hinduism consiousness is everything......but according to him physics is everything.... And Iam really confused about everything
Respect your own Intuition.
Brian Greene is just SO ERUDITE !
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
i wanna r-produc- with that prtty body!
So is nobody going to mention the actual demon lady?
I can listen to Brian Greene talk all day, this man has so many brilliant ideas and his perspective is unique and I can&#39;t do nothing but have the upmost respect for that man
It&#39;s so nice to see Brian interviewed for a change.
They have nothing new to say...
Could we perhaps think that space has always been here.   Now perhaps this takes place all over the known and the unknown millions of megaparsects could this happen all over space
I do absolutely enjoy all of your  shows and lectures thank you for reigning my interest in  physics and just waking up the part of me that made want to learn.
Love Brian Green, his passion and enthusiasm is contagious
Fascinating
amazing guy......
Wonderful episode!  Faith - energetic, smart and beautiful and a great interviewer! Same with Brian! :) <br>Love from sweden!
Wow, the butt-kissing comments are especially thick here.
You could argue that there is something rather than nothing because there is no evidence for nothingness other than the concept/notion of &quot;nothing&quot;, constructed by our brain. The vacuum of space isn&#39;t empty. Even &quot;Zero&quot; represents the depletion of a measured quantity rather than nothingness. Once we can prove that nothingness exists, we can argue for it,.
Nice boots man.
A collection of particles does not do &quot;it&quot;, they do not emerge consciousness (imho). Why does the majority of this era just buy that story without doubt, like a religion, without noticing?<br>Matter seems not fundamental - or e.g. why &gt;90% dark &quot;matter&quot;, hahaha?

When they mention the table, they are wrong. The table is made of atoms. Everything in the universe is made of atoms atoms is consciousness, so that table is conscious because it’s made of atoms.
Faith Salie was excellent. I confess I didn’t know who she was. Among other things (funny and engaging) . . . Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Magna.
Consciousness = not motions of particles, but motion of information carried by particles (or even without). This causes the emergence of complex meta-information?!
Thanks again.
Why is the universe not nothing? There is only one nothing, but there are an infinite number of ways something can exist. Therefore nothing is impossible. So the universe must exist.
Basic element of Time IS change.
I have questions : What is a dimension actually?  and another<br>what is the disturbance that vibrates the string in string theory?
It continues to bug me that Humans define entropy as having to do with disorder. Isn&#39;t disorder only a concern to us, or to the living, not to nature? Same thing with time&#39;s arrow, often described as being always forwards because we can&#39;t piece together a broken vase. But repairing so-called broken things is only a concern to the living. &#39;Degrading&#39; into &#39;disorder&#39; always seemed value-laden language. I always suppose these values are not shared by the cosmos &amp; that disrupts my understanding of entropy.
I don&#39; t see a contradiction between everything that Doctor Greene thinks, and explains so wonderfully, and the idea of an Entity  that might have created  these physical laws and the various particles ...I mean, the whole stunning immensity that surrounds us actually seems to REQUIRE it....
Free will = self determination and self ordering

Well Brian, there is a simple problem with this discussion of free will, we have no common and well defined definition of free will and that goes whether you are for or against the notion.
Top notch brain food!
Weapons of Mass Extinction will consume US all Be WARNED.
Brian Greene is incredible but can we take a moment to acknowledge what a wonderful, humorous, engaging, knowledgeable, and polite host Faith Salie is ❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=3073">51:13</a> not sure about polite
Yes very average indeed.
She represented the everyday person. However, if you listened to Brian, he was flying and not walking
This must be Faith’s YouTube account
Damn, you guys are so bitter lol. I really enjoyed this conversation which took place between these two people so I acknowledged them both. Going out of your way to insult her says more about you than her
@@greenteapeng_Agreed
Na fr 🥰
Agreed! My kind of people, that Faith Salie. 👌 I am grateful to see &amp; hear her, someone who has a silly/fun personality that tends to loosen people up and feel more comfortable in the conversation that alot of folks otherwise might feel left out. 😊 I for found myself inspired &amp; connected with such a charming &amp; intelligent person.
She’s not letting you hit brother 🙏
​@@greenteapeng_  I share your opinion of Faith as quite wonderful, but I&#39;m curious about your offense at the other opinions: &quot;very average&quot; and &quot;represented the everyday person&quot;.  Why are those insults?  Do you believe the average person/host (i.e.: with statistically common attributes) is inferior to others?  If someone did find her to be average as a person and/or host, is there a way of expressing that which you would find non-insulting?  Or is the thought itself definitively, irrevocably insulting and its expression in any form disparaging?  Either or both of the other commenters might have simply been expressing neutral observations of their perception of her as similar to other people/hosts without judgment, ideas of inferiority/superiority, while still thinking she&#39;s lovely (average people can be lovely, too)...  And if so, then reading insult into their words would say more about your own biases -- <i>your</i> negative perception of averageness -- than anything about the other commenters.
You have a very average opinion ​@@dismalthoughts
I can&#39;t listen to her shouting
The true Free Will involves a quantum levell among neurons and synapses in brain.
Why is Mr. Greene talking about The Big Bang as fact when is not? Its a theory made by a christian priest and remind us of the tale in the Bible.

Good interview.
Would have loved to see Eric Weinstein sit in as a second sounding board (or moderator), even though that would probably be the last thing Brian might suggest for a more balanced discussion (leaving out the &quot;compost&quot; if you will).
Dear Professor so good to have you! my question what if you are wrong? any other ideas than it is cold cold cold like Dante&#39;s inferno @Smolin physics != mathematics ? Can you please both write some &quot;war time&quot; book together ?
After what Brian Greene said about The Freewill and the illusion of it:<br>I have questioned myself, my life and it&#39;s meaning, and the meaning of the whole universe?<br><br>But I still believing in Freewill, and I think that the double slit experiment and observer effect may be a reflection of our Freewill.
There is a generous amount of semantics at work in such arguments.
The only validity to such arguments is that there is a less than infinite amount of choices you can make in any situation, therefore your choices are already made.

Drop strings Brian!!
But String Theory is looking anemic.
Thank you 😂😂😂😂
To understand yourself just write a book 😂😂😂😊
Great guest. She did her homework.
These topics and exploration of the universe bring me a joy that nothing else can. I only wish I had friends who enjoy the same intellectual debates as I do so we can share our rambles and thoughts as we talk through the night.
Who cares how long humanity lasts?  It makes no difference.  The human race is so ego maniacal, when in fact our entire existence most likely means exactly nothing.   And no, it doesn&#39;t matter if we are the only &#39;intelligent&#39; beings in the universe, or ever have been, or not.
Mr Greene is amazing.  Very smart and yet very humble.  Totally unassuming individual.  Respect!
So, when does a cup of cofee rise without free will???? The answer is NEVER.
Beautifully done. It&#39;s not about legacy. It&#39;s about this magic moment we live in now. We all have won the cosmos of lotteries! This tiny moment IS enough. I&#39;m 74 and have had a lifetime of adventure on. land and sea. I&#39;m headed to the Alaskan Wilderness in August. Live to you die. Live life to its top. And please let me say this magic is where you are right now. You don&#39;t have to Sail to the Bahamas or live in the Alaskan wilderness. You are truely free to live now. Don&#39;t waste a breath. Change your self-story if you have to. Now go live. Throw my ashes into the Bering Sea right after my last gasp.
The interviewer had to much &#39;fan girl&#39; vibe going.   Her constant adulation to Brian was not very illuminating.  I am always irked when interviewers talk about how they cannot begin to comprehend the genius of those they are interviewing.
Cool the sun will get closer to us an it&#39;ll be easier to extract energy from it. 👍
Incredible man, thanks Brian.
Brian is an awesome human being.
Always the same outfit...!!!😇😇😇
We want to get to the bottom of things. Science is the latest and best choice we have right now. Good philosophy can do it too. We are driven to get to the final whyy and how. Why do we do that?
Ego
@@debbino4249 Curiosity would be my first choice. But what do I know? I&#39;m not above it, I&#39;m in it.
Transcendence? Did Brian Green just agree to transcendence?
Many anthropologists and archaeologists agree that painting, singing, and drumming came before language. Maybe one hundred thousand years ago. Think Lalala ooooo. Lullabyes.<br>Also flutes made of tree branches...etc. art before language.
Excellent interview. I always learn new stuff from hearing Brian. He is a fantastic educator. Tremendous Faith and Brian for good 60 minutes.
Would anyone like to read about life having no meaning? Read Albert Camus. Mid twentieth century philosopher. The idea of no meaning is not new. He won the Nobel  Prize in literature.
If Brian is right about consciousness, there is no SELF. THERE IS NO I. Welcome to Buddhism and Hinduism.
My brain chemistry can allow me to make choices about how I want to do to change my brain chemistry. Part of what my brain chemistry can do is allow me to make choices between, let&#39;s say, a little bit of fun or a lot of fun. Both activities will increase my endorphins. But one will do it a better, so I choose that one.
Culture is susceptible to a type of evolution and entropy. When cultures start disintegrating/declining because of high social entropy, trouble will follow. We are at a point where our ability to destroy life on Earth is real. Cultural entropy is a major threat to all life on the planet.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2245">37:25</a>. We also have a SPIRIT and a SOUL. GOD is also SPIRIT.
You are expressing a belief. A belief is not a fact, no matter how fervent you believe.
What he doesn&#39;t seem to speak to is that 99% of all mutations are not favorable to a species and are completely unpredictable. Mutations occur randomly, and we have no idea whether they are going to be favorable or unfavorable to the existence of any given life form. Mutations are utterly random. See chaos theory.
If Jordan Peterson were a physicist... Speaking the Truth at every moment, with grace and respect.
Jordan&#39;s a Carnivore and Brian is a vegan , but they actually are similarly  interesting and enlightning.

This talk is GREAT
I wouldn’t have believed I could respect and appreciate another person I’ve never met as much as I do this man. What a unique grouping of molecules he is!
He is Wonderful! 😀
Truly a fantastic set of atoms!
Those molecules are Brianing, and they&#39;re doing it famously.
I love listening to Brian, his unique method of explaining things, draws me in and commands my utmost and ultimate attention! ※\(^o^)/※
Lest we forget, Newton thought science wouldn&#39;t exist by around 2060.
If everything is so ambiguous - consciousness. Imagine it being so debatable... Think about science itself, right?
I was going to say WTH, but I looked it up and you are correct.  Obviously Newton was a moron when it came to prediction, but then he was talking about Jerusalem etc above the date statement, so it&#39;s not surprising he went totally off into the weeds.
@@MrJdsenior He was a very intelligent man. He tried to decode the Bible as well.
We are so incredibly fortunate these days, to be able to listen to some of the brightest. Most enlightened scientific minds brought to us on YouTube . People like Brian and Sean, Carrol, and Richard Dawkins, in so many more. This kind of information was not really available before the Internet insights like YouTube. I really enjoy this kind of program.
Great interview.  Hope she isn&#39;t married.
Why?
She literally said she wished she was still dating. Came off a little thirsty.
Excellent and correct evaluation of the universe and reality. Just 3 aspects seem not clair:<br>1. Entropy: if a star is order and the surroundings disorder - that&#39;s 99% and 1% respectively and not the opposite.<br>2. in the far future how could the thermal leak of a thought be in the brick of causing disruption if by then the universe would be extremely cold and dark.<br>3. Free will: all human actions are expressed and enabled in reality by the the fundamental particles behaving as they&#39;re supposed to according to the quantum physics laws. They enable the process of action but are they the Responsible for the decision of raising the cup 0, 1, 2, .... times?
it is a comedy club :)
i live in nyc i walk through central park i have a daughter....god, how self centred and vain and off the point she is....
Top top top content!
Expanding left to right, north to south, what? Does the universe grow away from us, the Earth? The Earth is in the center, if so how centered? Our Sun?   I dont understand when we say the Universe is expanding... From what and where?  And what is it expanding into, how can something grow if it has no room to grow into or whatever?  I also don&#39;t know why the Term B. B. Needs to be so special to understand when we have our Bibles?  God says go and it doesn&#39;t matter how. I mean I&#39;m happy for us sure but we have much more to work on....   How do we know this is not first a concious experience?  All born by memory and mind power.  Nothing is we just think it is....and so what is relative?  Your mind will always be just as vast as this Universe. So what now?   Free Will, What about belief?   Is nothing more or less than what one believes?  Do you believe in free will?  And this is a letter, not a science show.  Yes you can think about free will in all the ways possible.
I don’t know what he’s referring to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2980">49:40</a> that is why most find relief from: the majesty of existence, the shocking implications of the mundane, and the incomparable unlikelihood of the real -- in beliefs that muddy up the whole proposition and provide longed for reversion  to automatic functioning of the associative thought-centric and quite free-will devoid &quot;mind&quot;.  If the need to entertain any story, no matter how lame, becomes feverish, we could be in a good spot, we could be in a bad spot, dependent on the pointedness of our point of view. If things get too clear we can always turn on the TV, or read a metaphysical tome, or watch a YouTube video that stimulates associations we enjoy, or worst yet most soothing of all, simply reminisce with limbic seasonings.  Keeps things in homeostatic balance: that being the glacial progress, with the emphasis on stasis, that evolution favors so much on the collective level -- not that it will do us any personal good outside of antibiotics and such.

Brian is so articulate. <br>Not 1 wasted word. He&#39;s great.<br>Host did an awesome job. Funny and quick-witted too.
articulate , yes! true, maybe, I seriously doubt. He makes HIS points very convincing
This is odd having her interview someone like Brian. His intelligence is vastly beyond this interview level of simplicity. Its like he is explaining QM to a 8 year old child.
I don&#39;t see it that way
Aka most people
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2400">40:00</a> Some of those stories are failed explanations of the physical reality of the ignition of dormant possibilities within the nervous and limbic systems, as opposed to the versa visa.  All concepts about such, are misconceptions, and can be nothing else.  Or to put it simply: just because you are not talking or thinking does not mean you are awake, but if your are talking or thinking, it does mean that you aren&#39;t.  At least while you are thinking or talking.
Excellent
Free will? . . . humph!  Wait until a quantum computer tells you what your next thought will be.  Then talk to me about free will.
Their are conscious organisms, such as lizards and birds (while they are not sleeping at least), and their are self-conscious organisms (like some humans, who at times are aware that they are conscious, like now, now that I brought it up)  but there is no &quot;consciousness&quot; outside of the act of being conscious, anymore than their is a &quot;runningness&quot; while sitting and reading.  Another example of misunderstanding arising from the same old propensity.  And the propensity is found in the amazingly creative ability for the  associative thought-centric mind to create conceptual models that do not correspond to reality.  Therefore providing civilization, culture, and technology to all the little particleules like youses and meses.  If you like: associate concepts about it -- but you can&#39;t get here from there.  Even if for some reason you suspect that you want to, which you won&#39;t.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=1710">28:30</a> . . . <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=1776">29:36</a>  -- Because there is no nothing.  Nothing is only a concept, and a foggy one at that.  And we all know that fog does not qualify as nothing.  I think P. Crunk said something like that.
Tell me, &quot;When is now?&quot; and I&#39;ll tell you &quot;What now is.&quot;  There is no time exclusive of space, nor space divorced from time, except in the reification of an abstraction so common it goes unnoticed.  No big deal? . . . I know.
No matter which tags u inherited by birth ( race, religion, country ) its Impossible not to have respect and love for people like Brian Greene, Jeff Hinton, Elon Musk..
The way he talks about Entropy and Order is whack as shit. He is just dumb as shit. I wonder who hes benefiting from all of this. I was once dumb like you people here who thinks he is smart(back in 2020) but really he isnt. Order and disorder are BOTH the essence of existence and not one is over the other, but he says it as if Entropy is dominant and proceeds to give a shitty and childish example like the formation of a star is on itself &quot;bad&quot; since it gives up heats 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There was a sexy tension between them
Brian and the table?
Hey, An Alumni of P.S.150 &amp; I.S.125 over here. Love how New Yorkers know. Sending love all the way from Yerevan Armenia
God I ADOREEEEE Brian
After hearing him talk several times I feel Brian Greene is someone you just can&#39;t do anything else but feel respect for.
Absolutely, and he has a great last name. 💯😂
I totally agree, it&#39;s so nice to listen to him talk every once in a while I go back to that interview he had with Joe Rogan. I haven&#39;t found anyone who&#39;s as articulate as him. He&#39;s really gifted with the ability to make everyone listen to him when he talks. Pardon my English
@@rushnande3731 Greene is very articulate indeed, but more important to me, he&#39;s very honest, neutral and &quot;us&quot; (human) without arrogance, without any hate, without divisive speech.

If temperature is motion of particles, then it is totally absurd to say that &quot;The temperature was very high when the big bang started&quot;, for there was not even space at that moment, let alone particles.<br><br>An instance of science wanting to &quot;have the cake and eat it too&quot;.
This man is a true rockstar of Physics
1 + 1 = 2 IS NOT A GENERAL TRUTH.<br>—---------------------------------------------------<br><br>If one ponders whether there exists any system of knowledge no scientist, philosopher, saint or whoever has ever disputed, then what comes immediately to anybody&#39;s mind is the system of arithmetic operations. <br><br>1 + 1 = 2 is often quoted as the best example of an undeniable absolute truth. <br><br>But are these operational rules so certain?<br> <br>Consider the following observations: <br><br>Imagine you add one heap (=lot) of apples to another heap of apples. Then you must write<br><br>1 heap + 1 heap = 1 heap<br><br>In this case it is very right to say <br><br>1+ 1 = 1<br><br>Therefore the statement that &quot;one plus one equals two&quot; is only a conditional fact and not an absolute truth.<br><br>Similarly also other rules of arithmetic. <br><br>For example if you take two heaps of apples with two in each and two with three in each and make five heaps with two in each, then the statement <br><br>2 heaps + 2 heaps = 5 heaps, <br><br>hence  2 + 2 = 5   is also correct.<br><br>  Have you ever seen even a single table of arithmetic operations, where it is mentioned that accuracy of these operations are conditional? <br><br> On the contrary,  the rules of arithmetic are often quoted as examples of &quot;absolute truth&quot; even by most stubborn philosophers. <br><br>It is taught that different catogeries (or units) cannot be added (operated, in general), but here it is the same catogery (units) ~  &quot;heaps&quot; of the very same fruit,  normally used to explain (prove) &quot;one plus one equals two&quot; ~ alone is involved.<br><br>And when you add two cubes of sugar into your tea <br><br>1 +1 = 0 is also correct.
I want to read Brian Greene new book!
That was the point of this video
Things go from &quot;order&quot; to disorder. Great. Where does &quot;order&quot; come from then? Physics is a religion at this point
Brian Greene is trying to save his career after hawking string theory for several decades. But, sure, big news is coming real soon. Right?
Yeah, I really don&#39;t think Brian Greene&#39;s career is in any turmoil... considering you&#39;re watching this on World Science Festival&#39;s channel, which he owns
@@proffeserdude I didn&#39;t watch it. I didn&#39;t click the Play icon, and I&#39;ve disabled autoplay. I don&#39;t watch things that I know from long experience will be a waste of time. I&#39;ve already wasted 30 years on string theory. Brian Greene&#39;s career now depends on YouTube. He&#39;s a personality now, nothing more. It&#39;s a sad way to go out. But we aren&#39;t willing to wait yet another &quot;just ten more years and then they&#39;ll have big news this time for sure honest really&quot;. Nothing is coming from string theory. Get over it.
@@eveningstarnm3107 So you took the time to write a half ass opinion on a video you didn&#39;t even watch? Pathetic
Dont trust a String theorist. All is as simple as this: Nothing cant exist.
Unless the evolutionary process ends with humans, which seems to be unlikely. It would seem we are destined to evolve into another species. Then, the battle we living beings have with entropy will eventually be won or loss by whatever beings we evolve into. Humans it would seem will cease to exist because hopefully they will evolve into a more advanced species.
Such brilliance and clarity. One only hopes and dreams, provided we’re successful and don’t disperse into an endless array of particles, where no 2 shall ever meet again, that when this all returns from wince time, space and everything came, that the consciousness that decided to randomly divide itself into particles, will remember everything, but not ever feel compelled to test the veracity of its own perfection again. But, what fun to remember everything, every particle, every star, every planet, and the lives of every being, in 360 degree technicolor consciousness, all that came about through its own division into creation. The awe and wonder never ceases ❤
Brian is spectacular, I&#39;ve read all of his books and watched most of the videos on YouTube. Boy, will he be surprised when he dies and joins the universal cosmic consciousness in the  God. There&#39;s just no way that this universe, our consciousness. and everything here just a random collection of particles . It is a carefully designed place precisely tuned so it would be able to cradle life and us and where there is design there is a Creator 😊.. ps also the irony of this interview conducted by a lady whose name is Faith , didn&#39;t escape me 😅
So carefully designed that its creator had to send a meteor to wipe out the dinosaurs to let the mammals take over , so well designed that the creator kills children with cancer , so well designed it took 230,000 years for us homosapiens to discover the fundamental laws of nature , improve our understanding and in the process make the welfare of humanity better year in tear out , yet there is absolutely no evidence for a creator what so ever other in the minds of men .
Lol. You are an unthinker.
That was a truly excellent meeting of minds, with the ultimately perfect conclusion that it is about enjoying the moments that we get. Physics is one thing but animal biology is another thing altogether, but what a wonderful opportunity it is that we have the ability in our time to appreciate complex nature can be. <br>Brian’s wrong though on self determination. A rail track with a carriage, the track determines the range of possible positions the carriage can be, but the carriage determines which of those possibilities suits it best over time. We all have self determination with in the range of possible freedoms and time.
A conversation like this on a Saturday evening in Stockholm is no less than a cosmic blessing! Thanks, Faith, and thanks, Brian!
Very good explanation because people can not understand the relationship between atom and universe and human purpose and function..excellent i can say
The universe doesn&#39;t have a single age. There is no single rate of time or measure of distance in the universe. 13.8 billion years happens in the timespan of 6,000 years depending where you are. The expanded distance in our line of sight between galaxies causes redshift and allows for light to arrive from distant galaxies within our timespand of 6,000 years. There are no inflatons or dark matter particles and the universe is not expanding into oblivion for no reason. GR explains all of our observations such as superluminal motion and things moving faster than expected like the outer spiral arms of galaxies. When you observe a galaxy, it&#39;s not like looking at a cat. You are looking at differing measures of time and distance. Evolution is imagined. No physical thing can ever make or direct itself. Every physical thing is from a supernatural cause. Get used to it and live with it. It&#39;s the reality.
You said the magic word, history. You really need to study ancient history before trying to do science. You wouldn&#39;t be making yourself look so bad if you knew where we came from and why all humans are so similar. We are all the direct descendants of the sixteen original ancient civilizations. Humans went through a bottleneck from the climate change caused by the global flood that destroyed the entire world. It&#39;s the only reason YOU exist. You should be more grateful. Have you ever heard of Assyrians? They are the civilization from Asshur. How about Arameans? Aram. Lydians? Lud. Elamites? Elam. Medes? Madai. Thracians? Tiras. Cushites? Cush. Canaanites? Canaan. Europeans? Gomer. Italians? Tubal Mediterranean Sea people? Javan. North Africans? Phut. Egyptians? Mitzrayim. Asians? Magog. Siberians? Meshek. Jews and Arabs? Arphaxad. You are just making up stuff since you hate the truth in the Bible. Do you want to be ashamed and embarrassed forever? <br><br>There&#39;s more. The Cohen modal haplotype identifies the Israelite tribe of Levi that Moses and Aaron belonged to. So that means Arphaxad&#39;s descendants are everyone with the IJ paternal Y chromosome haplogroup, myself included, believe it or not. The Elamites are the descendants of his younger brother Elam that have the Elamo-Dravidian semitic H haplogroup. The Assyrians are the descendants of their brother Asshur with the G haplogroup. People with the F1 F2 and F3 haplogroups are the descendants of the two youngest brothers Aram and Lud. Then there is a peculiar Hamitic haplogroup in west Asia that is C. They can ONLY be the direct descendants of the &quot;house of Nimrod&quot;, the first king of the world who began building the Tower of Babel. These descendants have a CF SNP marker that they share with the majority of the world&#39;s population while the haplogroups of A, B, D and E of his younger brothers and cousins do not have it. <br><br>There is another Hamitic D haplogroup in Asia near the Denisova Cave and east all the way to Japan that is from the Canaanite tribe of Sinim which is the biblical name for China, hence the name &quot;Sino&quot;, which is also where the word Sinai came from. Denisovans incidentally are a mix of Hamitic and Eurasian lineages. Neanderthals are a Eurasian lineage. That&#39;s the reason Eurasians have the most Neanderthal DNA. The first people in Italy were the descendants of Tubal and today there is still 8% of the population of Central Italy with the K paternal haplogroup. Thracians are L. The Mediterranean descendants of Javan are T. European descendants of Gomer are R. The descendants of the Medes are Q. The other Asians are the O descendants of Magog. Siberians are N from Meshek. A, B and C are Cush (Nimrod is the son of Cush). E1, E2 and E3 are Phut, Canaan and Mitzrayim respectively.<br><br>There is no getting out of it, humans did pass through the bottleneck of the global flood that destroyed the earth. Our geology is the direct result of the global flood. If you understand this, then you can learn to be a good scientist. The Bible names every one of the sixteen of OUR ancient civilizations before they became civilizations. The God of Israel is the only true God.
Please keep working on that one. I&#39;ve been waiting for a good breakdown like that. Let us make man in our image to me also says, why do we need to know that here, or now at this point of the word? It just allowed in my mind plenty of life action in whatever forms before that was said.  So what happened before we were made in Image form?  I don&#39;t have mans begginings here, just modern mans.   And so far, no harm done because we&#39;re saying the Earth is this or that old and God loves science so who knows and science can tell should we be able to stay with it back far enough......   Remember also, anything can happen according to it&#39;s creator.   Those are great odds, take them.
💜
That&#39;s a man
Awesome as always. It’s good to be back 😊
That interviewer is a spaz…like she just downed four pots of coffee.
This talk about entropy increasing (lower to higher state of disorder) is meaningless. <br>Order/disorder is a relative concept. <br><br>Ps. And remember that at the end of this process, all activity stops, and would that be total disorder, or total order?
Wow Faith is quite a lovable collection of particles. May entropy be small with her.
A wonderful program for getting to know a different side of a great mind in a great man called Brian Green. 💗

Carl was one of the most egomaniacal of all, just watch Cosmos and see what percentage of the time his giant talking head is on the screen.   Billions and billions...blah blah blah.
Brian&#39;s point here , is that we want the universe to have a purpose and meaning .We long for it to reciprocate our view of it . We cannot cope with the reality that it is just particles and molecules etc., and therefore , we must recognise that the parts of our life experiances that impact our soul are where we should actually invest the concept of meaning.
@@MrJdsenior This is worthless projection. You are woefully insecure and equally ignorant. You&#39;ve offered no argument.
It is said - in India - that the very Creation - is the way for God - to know Himself. May we all surprise Him - with love and the solving of the Great Mystery.
Many of the brilliant scientists in history were religious. We shouldn&#39;t create a dichotomy between the two. They exist in separate domains, which should not overlap as they contain different epistemologies.
Maybe religion is the manifestation of the &#39;Free Will&#39; problem referred to in this video.We need to believe we have Free Will because the reality of its absence drains our motivation to live.The need to determine our Fate, (when really we can&#39;t) , opens the door for &quot;Faiths&quot; that pander to this psychologically damaging reality. To cope  , many are willing to  ignore scientific facts for unproven/unprovable religious stories.Perhaps  those who don&#39;t need religion are not without Faith , but  actually just better able to cope with the  &quot;Free Will&quot;  issue.
@@kenadams5504 I would agree that believing in free will is a necessity. It not only provides motivation but allows for justice and morality. Without it a murderer can simply stand in court and blame the predetermined interactions of particles in his brain for committing the crime. We must live as though we have free will, regardless whether it is real or an illusion.
@@KAT-dg6el No - I said many were religious, not most.
@@ocean_0602 Of course , but , its also no harm to realise that the laws of physics apply to us in the same way as everything else that consists of particles and molecules. And , therefore , our belief of being free to determine our future is incompatible with the laws of physics .

The interviewer is excellent here. So many interviews fall flat because the questions are either posed in an unenthusiastic manner, or fail to cover the topic adequately

Not exactly Big Bang but the cyclic expansion and Contraction of the Universe has been postulated by the Buddha 2700 years ago.
That is Interesting.
​@@j.k.d.126I mean, there are only so many possibilities: the universe can only either stay the same size, expand, contract, or expand <b>and</b> contract. Zero disrespect to the Buddha, but he had a 4 answer multiple choice question and got it right.
a cyclic universe is a dreaful miserable picture. if strictly true, it means we are going to repeat all the horrible suffering all over again. what a nightmare.
@@maxwelldillon4805 In fact, none knows that the truth is! Everyone (Buddha to modern cosmologists) is giving their opinions on the basis of fragmented data. The Universe is so vast and our life-brain are so negligible. That is why, Buddha did not want to give more time in such metaphysical questions. By the way, if you are a graduate in Physics you might have read that Big Bang does not really mean explosion but expansion. Yes, cyclic big crunches give the sense of unending suffering but Buddha also gives the concept of Nirvana (end of suffering). Later Buddhism (4th Century BCE) accepts the atomism but early Buddhism (6th Century BCE) more focused on classical fundamental particles of earth, air, water and fire. When all these fundamental particles are ceased then an individual attain Nirvana. However, even though the Nirvana Concept sounds logical or might be possible to achieve individually but in scientifically it is still not possible to demonstrate.
@@Alex-js5lg I would like to suggest to read Agganna Sutta (in Columbia University Website). Yes, I agree with you. There are several possibilities. I was stating Buddha&#39;s Worldview just to tell that when we talk about Cosmology and Consciousness we must not forget Buddha. Science should be secular. Science must not be Eurocentric. Buddha has great influence on Greek Philosophies, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese and Japanese world views.

Brian I’ve considered the free will thing. I agree and would like to add a bit. <br>All of the chemical processes that take place within our brain an associated with them are summarized by their fundamental particles which exhibit quantum behavior. We are aware that means they behave probabilistic. This makes me have a different perspective. Maybe we still do not have free will. Because any outcome is possible, we perceive free will. Still bound by the physics as you mentioned.

Fu.............. Brian, you are really Smart &amp; Inside full. Thanks (Cosmos) for that!!!
What a great interview. Thank you!

I don&#39;t mean to be insulting but Faith really needs to style her hair with some bangs. That 5-head is overwhelming 😮
Yes you do and Brian’s is the same size if you’re into noticing things 🙄 should he style his bangs for your comfort too? 🤔
@@beachfly8066  you should think a little before hitting send my friend because you sound ridiculous....<br>     Brian is an aging male with a receding hairline, therefore it doesn&#39;t stand out.

Grow up.
Clarifying &quot;vegan* cheesecake&quot; made me smile. Thank you, Brian, for being an example to others, and openly carrying the plant-based torch that passed from Socrates to Plato to Da Vinci to Newton to Tesla to Einstein. Having vegan intellectuals like you around helps to prove the validity and viability of the movement. 💚
Was Einstein a vegan/vegetarian? I had no idea!
@@Xcalator35 yeah! Just during the final years of his life, but he did become an outspoken vegetarian during that time.

I&#39;ll miss you Brian, I wish I can inspire people the way you inspire me. I think this is the only way we get to a point that&#39;s worth it. Even if it&#39;s a high chance we won&#39;t, what&#39;s better than trying. That&#39;s the only way I can feel hopeful and not depressed. Thanks so much for sharing with us.
Could it be that consciousness is an undiscovered property of matter that enables free will?
no
Possibly, if there&#39;s some unknown quantum aspect of consciousness. I can&#39;t imagine a way for consciousness to have a direct effect on matter through any classical mechanism. As far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s no evidence to actually suggest that the two concepts are related, but the fact that we don&#39;t understand quantum mechanics theoretically leaves the door open for consciousness to play a role in it.<br><br><b>If</b> (and I really just can&#39;t make that <b>if</b> big enough) consciousness affects quantum outcomes, then surely when millions of neurons act as a collective consciousness by firing in concert and affecting functionally incalculable numbers of quantum outcomes, it would seem to me that that would constitute some form of genuine free will.
Consciousness equals thinking and physics equals matter. Ram Chandra says thought was first created - with &#39;I am&#39; - and then, came fear (of separation).
Freedom is given to us. We are free. We have the free will. Why do you put the law of physics above the freedom? We many times correct the blind path of the law. Don&#39;t you agree?
There is no free will. You are a sheep.
Live in the present it is all we really have!!  Learn from the past and wish for the future.  I would have liked Faith to ask Brian about sitting comfortably in &quot;One&#39;s Own Personal Concisness Bubble&quot; in a crowded nightclub interacting with your friends surrounded by hundreds of people indifferent to your very existence. You get this irresistible urge to look in a specific location behind you and lock eyes with someone specifically checking you out from a distance. Personally, I wonder if this phenomenon has some connection to the observer effect. Thank You!! for the discussion.
God Is all around us people. He interacts from the quantum world and collapses the wave when we get too close. We&#39;re not as smart as him. Have faith Love him and Love each other. God Bless
Brian talks about the romance of math, I only wish I had his experience. I had the opposite experience, math was torture, punishment, etc.. and therefore unpleasant. Yet I always knew in my gut that mathematics was clearly amazingly useful for our lives. So I&#39;m super glad math nerds are with us! Thanks to those who really get it and share their expertise so we can have the chance for survival.
Very True!!
Perhaps because he was not taught but took self interest
A lot of it depends on your maths teachers, i had one good maths teacher in all my schooling. Enthusiastic teachers can make or break an education.<br>I had two amazing history teachers and that’s what I concentrated on .
So well said!
@@issyjas3309 Agreed. My first algebra teacher taught with insults and shame. And the others weren&#39;t that much better. Nevertheless, I am glad they&#39;re math teachers that do inspire and motivate their students. I only wonder how I&#39;d feel about mathematics now if I had been introduced to math by different teachers.
@@mokujin29 yes, no doubt it helps to have an interest in the subject matter. I prefer the written language and have cultivated my writing skills over mathmatical ability. As I said in my comment, I&#39;m glad we have the Brian Greens in this world to do this work. It&#39;s certainly fascinating to try and understand and it helps when skilled analytical thinkers are there to explain what we do not have the base upon which to work it out ourselves. If you&#39;re a mathmatical person, thank you 👍👍
@@issyjas3309 I think that many &quot;math teachers&quot; at the high school level and especially below that, really have no understanding of what they are teaching outside of having memorized the maths.  If you ask them what practical use some equation may have, a lot of them will have no idea even though they know how to solve it.  Many people have trouble being interested in, and/or learning, something that is just memorization of rules without any info on how and why it was developed and is used for.
@@Scifi_Ape Lol, and let us not forget the indubitable advantage of the right head injury at the right moment in youth.  With good luck, you could end up an Einstein, then you could figure out the probability of receiving such a singular blow.
@AspeciousInversion  😹😹😹
Math was torture for me at school too, but I&#39;ve since found great teachers online like Eddie Woo, 3b1b, Khan academy, etc. They&#39;ve really helped me restart the love for math that I had back when I was 7 but almost completely lost thanks to school.
@@SkyRiver1 100% this.  Many can&#39;t even articulate an alternative way of working a problem out.  They know the one way the text shows and that is the extent of their knowledge.  I went from being a gifted math student in middle school to failing grade 11 math because I went from naturally understanding to being taught to regurgitate memorized equations.
I like how Brian Greene and Max Tegmark both have the same idea about how we are all just particles.  I was really entertained by this one.
A stupid, futile statement that should impress no one with a modicum of intelligence
But we also have to delude ourselves into thinking that we have Free Will,  ( in order to evade the sense of powerlessness that the physics reality instills in us ).

That&#39;s literally his job. He&#39;s a media personality, a professional actor, a &quot;science communicator&quot;, and he&#39;s very skilled at it. If he didn&#39;t portray enthusiasm, he&#39;d be bad at his job, and no one would pay him.

​@@CandidDatequite an amusing comment, during &quot;sterilised&quot; times, governed by the dogmatic political correctness. Underrated.
​@@smlanka4u &quot;JWST discovered galaxies older than the Big Bang.&quot; It&#39;s crucial to understand that galaxies being &quot;older&quot; than the Big Bang is physically impossible. Initially, the observation was indeed surprising as galaxies were detected earlier than our models predicted. However, the case of CEERS-93316 was reexamined; originally identified at 250 million years after the Big Bang (redshift z≃16.4), spectroscopic follow-up revealed a redshift of just z=4.9, around 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. This discrepancy was due to three overlapping properties that simulated the expected colors of a galaxy at z≈16 in the analysis.
​@@otinanisweirdo
​@@smlanka4uAlso, your statement about black holes growing without absorbing ordinary matter leading to the possibility of a Big Bounce is not supported by current scientific understanding. While black holes can indeed grow in ways other than absorbing ordinary matter, this fact doesn&#39;t directly correlate with theories about the universe&#39;s end or the concept of a Big Bounce. These are intricate topics that can&#39;t be connected in such a straightforward manner.
Wu wei, &#39;ya got it.
How anyone could think it would have been somehow easier, more natural, more logical, etc. for there to have been a fictional metaphysical &quot;nothing&quot; than the &quot;something&quot; everywhere in front of our eyes is beyond me.
It&#39;s only natural to question the origin of things, the &quot;something&quot; in front of our eyes being one of those things.

@@kathyorourke9273 . No need to ridicule.<br><br>Yes I believe in a God. I also love science. I appreciate Brian&#39;s respect for people of faith. Furthermore, although Brian does not believe in a creator, he seems to have a spiritual side, appreciating the order of the universe, almost like Spinoza. Einstein was the same. Brian is clearly yearning to believe. He does not believe, as his mindset would not allow it, and that&#39;s ok. But unlike Dawkins or Sean Carrol, Brian is an atheist who seems to wish that a God does exist. Whereas the former 2, would be angry at the very idea of a God, and would literally find anyway to not believe. What I&#39;m saying is Brian seems sincere in his atheism, he does not seem to be pushing an agenda. Other scientists on the other hand are hell bent on disproving a God .
Is she a host on Science Goes to the Movies?
Who puts  that system /order in the Universe that provide an exact movements and patterns in the existings?
Huh?
I mean, the exact movements and patterns are all part of an apparent equilibrium which seems static in small scale but it&#39;s dynamic in a larger scale. So pretty much nothing has order in the grand scheme of things. Just random stuff. We only look for patterns so that we can do math on it.
Always look forward to any nuggets of truth ✝️ from Brian Green.

If dark energy were moving through the universe like heat through water, mass should be brought together like foam on the surface. That would require dark energy to move faster than light, maybe with continued influence from the cosmic origin on mass. Or for a strange geometry in time space
I&#39;m confused.  Much of this discussion centers on the idea of demonstrating that gravitational waves exist - in the first place.  But didn&#39;t Taylor and Hulse already demonstrate that in 1974 using pulsar timing measurements at Arecibo with sufficient credibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1993 ?
Dr Chiara is amazing, to be so elegant, clever and explain things so well.

Professor Greene it is such a pleasure to watch these. I will never waste a minute of my life thinking this world is simple and boring. Society has come between greatness and I for far too long. Here I come.
Is it a gravitational wave if the object first comes closer and then goes further away. I observe from afar, does the strength of gravity vary? A normal thing like the tide in the phenomenon?
🙃🙃Maybe the universe is not expanding maybe it is us and our measurements that are shrinking.
Interesting how gravity n dark matter/energy affect each other?
Charging a single eggcelle with 0,0002% nano Mandohurts, before combining the following of a single sperm cell dropped at 5 hours intake attraction point from a black hole is plenty enough impulse map vibration for the sperm cell to find the egg on the third side of space, however the expansion after they meet increases the dark ecco in such a way that it rifts up 2 meeting&#39;s galaxys, so is it possible to bend the time with a split in the end so it soften the acceleration when they meet, without using darkyears as measurements ?
I have to say it. The dark matter filiments resemble a neural net.
Thank you! Appreciate  your brilliant Narration surge of expansion etc.. Gives me a window of insight on your cosmology explorations with your telescopic lenses with its varied tech progress! To answer &quot;Why&quot;? ❤❤❤for sciences matters Thank you!😮
It’s enjoyable to see how excited they are discussing these topics. Fascinating stuff when you are in the right frame of mind to truly listen.
great leacture
In my view the phenomenon of gravitational waves indicates that space time is compressible. This indicates that space time has a variable density. I would expect that density to increase in the presence of baryonic matter so that a large amount of mass will bend the path of light in the same way that light passing through air and entering water is bent. I think that Einstein used the wrong terminology to describe this effect: mass does not curve space but rather compresses space. This may indicate that matter doesn’t exist within space but rather it displaces space. Therefore the larger a mass is the more dense the adjacent space will be.
It is not science. It is pure fantasy. And, yes. I am waiting for cosmology fanatics who will tell me that I do not understand mathematics behind these &quot;theories&quot;.  Theories without any way to be tested.
Dr.brian Greene is the inspiration and one of the revolutionaries of science field who is increasing the awareness about importance of science.
We have no idea what dark matter and dark energy are.  Physicists have “fudged” the formula to get it to agree with what they observe.
In a corner of his house, Dr Brian Greene hosts the most coolest physics forum there is! I only have one question as the result of watching this gravitational discussion.. Is a black hole made of dark energy/matter?
Hi, you could just have a laser source in sphere with bilateral minimal blind spot and achieve the same thing on a smaller scale.
Indians are only contributing scam data and Chinese are only contributing fake data 😂😂😂
How can the fabric of space and time be moving but we are not? This makes zero sense to me
Are we magically exempt from the laws of physics when it comes to gravitational waves? Do we say the Earth is travelling in a straight line as it orbits tthe sun? What the hell is she saying!?
Keep watching Minecraft videos and worshiping whatever clown promises you an afterlife. If you&#39;re genuinely curious just google it you goof.
If black holes absorb other black holes is it possible that they also absorbed the original star the first black hole of the culmination field supernova&#39;d from?
Thank you Dr. Greene for taking us on yet another cosmological ride full of knowledge, awareness and ecstacy 🙏 you know i can never consume enough of your videos, they&#39;re just too short. Thank you for raising the quest in me to ask questions to myself about myself. Hope you keep these deep physical knowledge of cosmology keep coming in the future 🙏
I love when guest speakers are as eloquent as brian green and dont say uhm or uh after every word as some do
Thank you for a wonderful presentation with excellent guests!
Is anti-matter something that could be in between dark matter and matter? If so would dark matter absorb velocity before matter up until a limit before matter can react?
Neil DeGrasse Tyson answers this on StarTalk.
Dr. Brian Greene with a Dave Portnoy reference is pleasant but mind-blowing enough for the today, thank you.
what if we find evidence of gravity waves that have reflected back at us from the &quot;back wall&quot; of the universe?  lol!
Those videos are always over to fast
Thank you, this was great!
Brian greene thank you for all the very interesting information over the years I personally think you are the smartest man alive today ❤
Brian Greene - communicator extraordinaire!
Wow! What great conversations with Chiara and Jason to help us lay people keep up with the amazing research projects to better understand the cosmos.
Sry, something funny from me, cause I know the Americans will like this (Me PhD, started st Otto-Hahn Building, Berlin, Germany, podtdoc and fac member Harvard, cancer research)<br>In the 90ties, I made a allogorie about my PI, me PHD student, for reasons about him: He is like the Heisenberg particle- wave dualism.<br>e.g. you do not know what is going on 😂😂😂
Great a woman!!! I started in Berlin with science in the Otto-Hahn Bau in Berlin, Germany! Lise Meitner!!! <br>And sincenI have been a teenager Marie Curie was my role Model! <br>Than came Heisenberg and others.<br>I studied Biology, than switched to medical research, cancer research and from 2001-2008 and Harvard, first Postdoc and than became even a faculty member at Harvard Medical school
Is it possible that there is a space that is preexisting that our universe is expanding to fill, and what looks like a force pushing out and expanding the universe is actually a vacuum pulling out?
Thank you Dr Greene! I&#39;m just a regular guy who works in a factory, but the nature of reality is very important to me. Thank you for bringing this data and these ideas to people like me.
We are all just regular people trying to understand shit. Job and social status are not that important for the desire to understand these things in my opinion.
What is the vertical/diagonal band which crosses the galactic plane, which Euclid won&#39;t be scanning?
Die hard fans were also expecting your glass of &quot;brownish&quot; tea... the real dark matter imho :) ;)
Such a crush on Chiara.....😍
Fabulous listening to you guys. I follow ESA on Facebook, if you don&#39;t, please do as you get all the info for and from the missions. I&#39;m obsessed with dark matter and dark energy so bring it on Brian!
Is there a distance close enough to earth to where we would feel these gravitational waves but far enough away not to destroy the earth??? If you could hypothetically  move the two blackholes.
@briangreene
I miss your videos Brian! ‘Equation of the day’ videos during the pandemic were my favorite
i love this scientist. chiara is eloquent!
she is one hot scientist
Chiara&#39;s sound effects are A+.
Even LIGO India is coming up soon!!
I had a fun time joining the live
I plead the fifth
that 1st gravitational wave almost killed me...
&quot;What were you doing for 15 years??&quot;<br><br>LOL this was my question as soon as the timeframe was mentioned 😂. Taking the time to collect all this good data is pure dedication. Thanks for your work.
Do you know that time is never stop to light poton?<br>but time is decreasing to poton.
It looks to me correctly or wrongly like we make predictions we have no business making.<br>We need to spend more time doing things like identifying different types of energy.<br>Because as I said we make in my opinion, too many premature conclusions.
Lol  , just think some day we may have gravitational wave radio. Songs like Yoi put the weight on me will be popular!
I&#39;ve been reading Brian Greene for don&#39;t know how long, but <i>seeing</i> him visibly enjoy the same topics that intrigue us, too, is another matter, a <i>light</i> matter.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJuOQWCyMAc&amp;t=1934">32:14</a>  One of my puppies did that tonight, but he also snapped his leash. So, naturally, I&#39;m wondering whether or not spacetime or its fields could snap from the tension on them? Would they form new loops of the string, vibrating at new relative frequencies and so as different particles?
Excellent interviews, so informative. Dr. Greene brings out the best in his guests.
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
... or at the  <i>very</i>  least we start looking/thinking in these other ways, or directions.<br><br>ive become more and more disappointed over the last 20...30 &#39;odd years because of the unwillingness to even think in these... other ways.<br><br>admittedly its taken me most of that same time to open up to them,<br><br>I was very &#39;science only/has all the answers&#39; based and unwilling to examine these &quot;so called&quot; fringes<br>but, if honest they are just other ideas /points of view and in many cases being thought of, or believed in for much longer.<br><br>i sometimes wonder if this build up of &quot;dark matter /energy&quot; (2 other words for... we don&#39;t know)<br>is the &#39;manifestation&#39; of the enormous amount of information  we have generated in the last few hundred years<br><br>painted onto higher dimensional &#39;shaped&#39; objects that we can only see/interact with the equivalent of a shadow, or reflection of our &#39;every day&#39; objects<br><br>a reflection/shadow of something having vast amounts of near massless, but seemingly correct information about the objects<br>but only when viewed in a very certain way<br>like slices of the 3d object does when viewing in flatland/lower dimensions...<br><br>I hope that makes some sense 😊

How about this?  Dark Energy is rivers, pockets and/or bubbles of faster moving time or &quot;Light Time&quot;.  Dark Matter is rivers and bubbles of slower moving time or &quot;Heavy Time.&quot; <br>Mira, look, we see an electron orbit however many times a minute. We set that as our base reading, right? For our plain of existence, anyway.  However, in these pockets of Dark Energy or &quot;Light Time,&quot; that same electron now has readings of a billion times a minute because time is &quot;light&quot; here and passes a billion times faster.  Or, energy where there shouldn&#39;t be energy / dark energy / Light Time.  Dark energy IS &quot;Light Time.&quot;  It&#39;s the difference in TIME that we&#39;re seeing!<br>Now we look at the other side of the coin, Dark Matter or &quot;Heavy Time.&quot;  <br>Mira, look, if, &quot;Light Time,&quot; is faster pockets of time.  It stands to reason, &quot;Heavy Time,&quot; would be slower pockets of time, right?  That same base electron now moves a billion times slower and appears to stand still.  Get a pocket full of seemingly motionless nothing and you get a pockets/rivers/bubbles of dark matter or &quot;Heavy Time.&quot;  &quot;Starving of time,&quot; or slower pockets in time, creates a vacuum or attraction in space.  Since these pockets/rivers/bubbles of &quot;Heavy time&quot; are &quot;starving of time&quot; and everything outside these regions of dark matter are in a faster flow of time, it makes it appear dark matter is attracting when really it&#39;s just a vacuum, IN TIME, trying to equalize.<br>Making it stand to reason, by my, &quot;I&#39;m not smart enough to give anything more than this simplified reasoning, that Dark Matter is &quot;HEAVY TIME&quot; and Dark Energy is &quot;LIGHT TIME.&quot;  Could be. ;-P  Now think about this.  As light travels through the universe and passes through these pockets, bubbles or rivers of Heavy Time or Light Time, doesn&#39;t that alter that appearance of this beam of light?  Doesn&#39;t that beam of light that is say, 40 million years old, now look like it&#39;s 100 million years old?  Or vice versa, a 100 million years old beam of light now looks 40 million years old.  If I&#39;m right, it would explain why these 6 &quot;old&quot; galaxies are being discovered.  We are observing them through rivers/pockets/bubbles of different flowing time.<br>Also, if I&#39;m right and someone proves it, you must name it after me and give me a cut of the Nobel prize winnings. (25% is fine) Pass it on please and thank you.  ;-P
I&#39;ve been posting this story for a while, now.  Is it possible it&#39;s related to gravitational waves?<br>Time is fascinating. I worked the subway stations for nearly 10 years. From one end of the city to the other. Every so often I would notice the city would be saying that, &quot;Today just flew by&quot; or &quot;The day was just dragging along.&quot;  How can an entire city, with no interaction with each other until they used the subway, complain about the same time paradox unless it was effected by it? Maybe a time distorted bubble the earth passes through in its revolution around the sun. Maybe random waves of time distortion hitting the earth? Maybe they&#39;re given off by the sun. Maybe they&#39;re from outside our Terran system and reach us in intervals. ???? Ti-i-i-ime, is on my side. Yes, it is!<br>If you can think of a better way to do a blind survey of an entire city, in the small window of opportunity, I&#39;m all in.  Until then, I invite you to spend a couple years in the subways, during rush hour and you&#39;ll see for yourself.  Just listen as an entire city gets off of work and gets out of school.  You&#39;ll see it&#39;s more than a, &quot;coincidence of circumstances.&quot;
that&#39;s an interesting observation<br>and as i understand it, yes, <br>like a boat riding the waves, a large wave (or smaller boat) has to ride it as a whole<br>up one side then down the other
My idea so I get to name it! What I mean is, no one has claimed it so I&#39;m officially calling, &quot;Dibs.&quot;  Voyager 1 is now in the, &quot;Milky Way&#39;s interstellar time&quot; or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;<br>&quot;V-ger&#39;s&quot; message has sped up now that it&#39;s outside our Sun&#39;s, &quot;Time Bubble,&quot; or, &quot;Terran Time.&quot;  It will be faster, still, when &quot;V-ger&quot; sends a message from beyond the Milky Way&#39;s time bubble. Then there&#39;s Outside the Local Group time bubble.  So on and so on until we get outside any influence and into the, &quot;True Interstellar Time Standard.&quot; Or, &quot;T.I...&quot; ;-P<br>Now that &quot;V-ger&quot; is outside our Sun&#39;s reach, in interstellar space, it&#39;s now in the Milky Way&#39;s faster moving, Interstellar Time or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;  This can be proven by turning off everything except its clock and transmitter.  Have &quot;V-ger&quot; read time for as long as possible.  They WILL show the flow of time speeds up the further away you get from any celestial bodies.  Until you reach the Milky Way&#39;s time standard or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;<br>•Our sun&#39;s time bubble: &quot;Terran Time&quot; we know and have measured.  In a lifetime, our head is one second younger than our feet.<br>•Milky Way&#39;s time bubble or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot; The rate/flow of TIME outside any influence but within the Milky Way: We just got there and are still figuring what the difference is. Wild guess I&#39;d say time will increase in speed, now and until V-ger is outside the Ort cloud. <br>•Local Group&#39;s time bubble or the rate/flow of time outside of any influence but within the Local Group: Name still open and unknown. Wild guess .08 P-22% to a couple seconds faster, maybe. Used just for reference.<br>•Outside any influence in the, &quot;True Interstellar Time Standard.&quot; (or T.I...) ;-P  This name is NOT up for grabs. The rate/flow of time is fastest here.  (Time flows fastest here so it&#39;s best to use a motor boat and hold tight.  Always applies when you&#39;re in T.I....) ;-P<br>A minute is a minute in all. It&#39;s the rate/flow I&#39;m talking about.  Heck, rivers of time flowing differently might explain dark energy and dark matter. <br>The Milky Way&#39;s Interstellar Time Standard will be known as, &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;<br>Pass it on, please and thank you!
i&#39;ll set a timer 25M years from now.. don&#39;t worry y&#39;all
Wow. It&#39;s back. Love these long dialog discussions. More please with guests love it <br>❤
Finally the shows continue again. Could we have an indepth episode around the possibility of black holes actually creating universe&#39;s within as the laws and the way it wouldcappear to work make sense minus a few human errors.
So nice to meet you again in this beatiful green place from Your Daily Equations 💚 Thank you for another great session and best greetings from Poland👋
The concept of NEUTRON STARS - of all things - being &quot;squishy&quot; boggles my mind as much as learning that a teaspoon of neutron star would weigh like 10 million tons.
Science is entertaining. But most science educators choose to be irrelevant when it comes to the ongoing sixth mass extinction, which is being caused by technology, the child of science. We are eradicating life on earth. Perhaps the only life in the universe. That is the legacy of science.
Wow! They saw Omm in gravitational waves! ❤<br>And equlid is an amazing achievement of mankind<br>Thank you sir for those two interviews 🙏
Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis <br><br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of matter? Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can also be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the “fabric” of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point leaving pockets of inelastic spacetime geodesic that cause gravity without the presence of matter? <br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn’t expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn’t require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it…
Why only two arms for LIGO? Wouldn&#39;t a “3D mesh” of arms give us much better detail? Surely we could separate out the direction and magnitude of the waves with an array of detectors.
A Fan Causes Ripples In The Air, But Could Also Be Like A Reptile Shedding It&#39;s Skin In All Directions And More Frequently?!?
Yes, pretty cool and entertaining but in the reality of life and humanity it&#39;s useless
Planed demic, my friend, for someone so smart your very dum. Sorry again planed demic
While I am sure there is plenty of room at he L2 point for the instruments parked there now and planned in the next few decades, is there any risk of cluttering it up?  Or is the L2 point sufficiently orbitally unstable that instruments that fall into disuse will drift out of the region?
Oh nonononono. Again,
In a tug of war game, both of team members are on the same ground (same plane).  What about tug of war in our solar system?  Are their orbits on the same plane or changing time to time?
yes, we are all &#39;playing&#39; on the same &#39;ground&#39; or space /time as its called.<br>or &#39;Substrate&#39; is a word I like to use

Welcome to the PTA meeting.
Why are those scientists shaking their heads so much? Does this help with thinking or are it the gravitational waves?
So gravitational waves are not effected by time dilation?<br>When two BHs are merged, time is slowed down relative to the earth.  Like a movie &quot;Interstellar&quot;, one hour on the planet next the BH was 7 years on the earth relatively.  So say it took 2 seconds at the last moment of the merge and we here on Earth detected it.  It&#39;s still the same 2 seconds?  No time delation?  Would that mean there&#39;s no &quot;red-shift&#39; because of the expansion of the universe, spacetime?
Lies and propaganda...Good luck
So where did you get your Ph.D. in physics, Slappy?
The online and upcoming new powerful tools and techniques will allow us to progress in the cosmos understanding. Amazing and unthinkable discoveries awaiting.
brilliant as always Brian
i like Brian Greene he cool
Einstein was a dumb. Physicists and mathematicians of that time where almost going to discover GR anyways. Even I concluded the same equations of special relativity by self studying electrodynamics.
go take your medicine
Thank you Dr. Greene for being there for us during those Covid days - this does take me back. Let’s keep this tradition.
Great analogy on cosmic strings by Brian. I feel like I somehow understand
Dr. Greene bringing that &quot;3rd funeral this week&quot; energy for this episode. Lol. Still amazing as always.
What is Brian without his presentation slides ready at hand? This...
Can&#39;t wait to see the cosmic gravitational wave background in relation to the cosmic microwave background.<br><br>Wow. Thanks guys for discovering more about gravity. And now we have  the ability to see the universe in the way a bat does.
Dr. Greene, if I could suggest a topic, it would be the origin of the Solar system and how similar or rather, different from exo solar systems it seems to be, thank you!
As a die hard fan, yes 😂 love to have you all back
Gravitational Wavea aren&#39;t real. Famously, scientists even aren&#39;t clear yet what is gravity itself...
neat!
Brian greene is one of my favourite physicist and I eagerly wait for his videos as they give us an edge to think over the research related ideas ...He is one of the best and amazing speakers.
Gosh, Brian has to be the hardest working physicist. Bravo ❤
Happy day, happy day! Thank you Dr. Greene!
Roger Penrose suggested that in our universe there could be Gravitational Waves from Black holes coming from a previous universe in the very far past. If such a previous universe Existed and if Black hole morgens emitted gravitational waves: could these waves be measured with the Neutron Star method? Or would such waves Still be beyond our reach and not a Potential source?
How wonderfully blessed we are to live among such brilliant Minds <br>who continually and doggedly peel back the many layers of secrets <br>our Universe holds.  Stunningly impressive and inspirational work.<br>Thank you Prof. Greene for introducing these amazing people to us.<br>Chiara is a very talented science communicator.
Also, how counter-intuitive is it to hear something as compact as <br>a neutron star be described as &#39;squishy&#39;, but that black holes <br>which are essentially extreme gravitational wells in spacetime, be described <br>as being &#39; hard &#39;, and not deforming under these extreme conditions. <br>Mindblowing stuff.
I&#39;ve always been curious about the structure of the universe, like if we could map out the universe in an I instance of time, mapping light years. What would that look like
Lets suppose that the universe is an entity that would cause gravitational forces to other objects outside of itself. if that gravity couldnt go anywhere, what would happen? if it is able to impose itself outside of the universe what would happen from our perspective? is it possible that time itself is another form of gravity like xrays are another form of light?
A solar system sized black hole.. orbiting another black hole the size of our solar system... That&#39;s some serious imagery. Even though we don&#39;t know why gravity is. I love you world science festival

Hi... watching from Mexico
It looks so bright and green behind you.
That justifying his name Green-e👍 I pronounce his name as Brain-Green😄 He is such a charismatic and enthusiastic scientist 🎉🎊
Thank you, most interesting, I hope to travel to NYC in September.
I miss those long Q&amp;A Brian that you did during the pandemic <br>Feel a nostalgia for those days.
As a layman in this area ... <br>I understand that two orbiting masses should spin arround each other forever ... but they loose velocity and collide and one way they loose that energy is by dispersing gravitational waves. Is this correct? If so it then implies that energy is required to change the state of gravity. It also implies that there&#39;s a direct similarity between electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves. It&#39;s just at a different scale.
Oh shoot! I missed being here when you were live.  So glad to see you doing these again!
I want to formulate a new theory of the existence of a particle that ensures symbiosis of a biophysical system, considering it to be a first step in accommodating this great flow of energy, which follows to be assimilated through applied technology. Thank you!
Thank you Brian, your team and guests for another wonderful session. I am very much just a layman but I have always thoroughly enjoyed your work and I  appreciate the work and effort to keep the broader public informed on the cutting edge of subjects in science in general, especially the physics and cosmological topics.<br>Thank you from the UK.
Awesome! Best start to my Saturday morning walk
Hi Brian... Regarding reversibility, it is a very important topic, what makes the transition between the relative dimension and a new dimension of resonance energy, being considered  that a system of human accommodation with the environment. It represents a symbiosis of matter to future conditions of existence.Regarding gravitational waves, it is good to understand this inexhaustible source of energy to be assimilated by technology, to be supported by living matter, the conversion of this energy gravitational, in resonance energy that can be used in different fields of activity. Regarding the black holes of the Universe, I consider them to be the accumulation of large amounts of energy,in a perpetual transformation, this wonderful event horizon...respectively I consider it to be a great gravitational potential, a great amount of energy in a continuous transformation...Let&#39;s remember the bell effect, which provides both the sound effect through resonance, but also the disinfection of a biophysical system, but also of the respective environment. The same is true of these black holes, which through this bell effect ensures the cleanliness of the Universe Thank you!
The evolution of dark matter and matter looks so much like how our brain’s neural network forms does it not?  Isn’t that remarkable? I just find it so beautifully ironic, almost as it is intended.  Patterns like this are everywhere in nature.  The universe is no exception.  What a wonderful time to be able to discover these things … we are the pioneers for future generations.
We are in the brain of god ❤

And it can  assist all the way,  everything down to me just doing it. Myself,  or by means of business.  Allowing us to have what we deserve folks,  the totaly capable AI is in our own weaknesses.That we will do this Alexa, Siri,  1.0-10.0 thing can be our thorn in our sides. When we can really have so much more. We must learn to trust and use our human potential to its fullest.  To work hard, to be difference, to create a state of flow in what we do.  This is where we need to be.  Not just behind ourselves, or settled for lesser things. We are creating to much waste this way today.   The good news is that more and more we know it.
Find a therapist.
I Really like the idea of space being a partical
Very eloquent presentation! Although i would be curious mister Greene to hear your real point of view on a foundation that it’s main goal is to blur the laypeople about a non existing relation between two incompatible identities…
I still have no idea what cosmic strings are ^^ I wished he would have used more a mathematical description. Now, I am not sure if he talks about topology or geometry or fields or if it just was a nice image.
Here we study in space, gravity, etc. What could and should be right. So, what exists?  What is everything already?   Think about what we study in that of which we create.  If we create those waves themselves, then what can we do with them.   Like poop. If we make poop, what can we do with it?    Where is the Earth located in the universe?   Are we on one end or another?  Are we in the middle of it?   Is there a map to the universe inside our heads yet to be discovered? How can we put one there? Can you download a memory, what would that consist of and look like, for me in my minds eye, and for others by using technology and things?   Question is,  why travel in the universe using material kind, if we can utalize our minds and do so too?  Perhaps a hybride type of control would be sufficient.
Hi Guys; what&#39;s the force carrier for the G wave and/or the medium transferring the wave energy across space? Please disregard the headlights and get out of the roadway.
Dark energy is clearly a particulate coupling effect where high z clusters show common disk galaxy plane orientation with the same  axis extension in the direction of red shift propagation. The galaxies are exhibiting a &quot;windsock effect&quot; forcing the disks into the laminar gravity flow that couples with the baryons to extend orbits in the direction of red shift. This concept of a laminar flow of quantum gravity is consistent with a gravity working fluid that has diminishing effectiveness as gravity while increasing its effectiveness as the space-time viscosity working fluid. I.E. fast gravity creates gravitational propulsion while slow gravity increases space-time viscosity that manifests as dark energy. The Hubble Constant just measures how much of the gravity flux is slowed to impotency over a megaparsec.
Clearly 😅

For any late watchers of this program, you can be assured that all of the Cosmos is in perfect harmony with our Creators will! Find answers in the four gospels you can trust. :-)
JWT IS SO IMPRESSIVE. What many may not realize is that IF EXOPLANETS are found Say - 1/3 of way across the Galaxy (Milky Way) - That Planet&#39;s Light has been traveling to Earth for 30,000 to 50,000 Years. A lot could have happened since then. For Galaxies Millions of Light Years away, that could be a lot of change...or evolution.
Always like a good episode of The World Science Festival.

This was a great interview, thanks WSF, hoping to watch more of these talks this year!
The notion of life needing water on planets where liquid diamond rains, in wildly different environments than Earth seems biased and unscientific.
:)
Dr Greene is such a great host and presenter. I think his most admirable quality, besides his intellect, is his low ego. He doesn&#39;t have to act like the smartest person in the room (cough cough Neil deGrasse Tyson) and let&#39;s others teach him (and us) in a very comfortable and non combative way.
Generally speaking the smartest people in the room usually don&#39;t mind not being thought of as the smartest person in the room.  Only those who have egos with something to prove are the ones who need to be known as the smartest person in the room.

allin rimay Brian
A few things. She keeps saying dust ice clouds? Those all are biological processes. Dust is organic, ice is frozen liquid water or transition metal, and clouds of particles?  4 seasons ? You only need four season if you have a plant cycle or something similar. Also she says they have to proint the telescope at a Star first to the capture an image of Neptune/Uranus.. lol. The truth is all between the lines and poor use of words as descriptions. In or outside the lexicon of Astrophysics and Asto-Bio-Chemistry.
OMG, all they show are simulations, cartoons. DID WEBB BLOW UP?<br>ANSWER ME THIS<br>Since galaxies travel in space time as they cross the universe, emitting light along the way, then we should be able to observe the same galaxy at different places in the sky, different places in the life of the galaxy and universe, by figuring out the direction of the galaxy and its speed, then mapping the universe forward and backward in spacetime and making observations there. IN OTHER WORDS,, as an example, If Galaxy A is observed to be 1 billion light years away when the telescope aims at in say in Andromeda, and we could extrapolate or guess which way it came and/or which way it is going then we could find it elsewhere in the sky, say at 2 billion years ago, and half a billion years ago. WHERE IS THIS WRONG?
Sorry to say that about the space water , when the creation of the earth God separate half of the water on Earth and the half to up side and the middle place is called space see Bible (Genesis 1: 1-8) <br>this is made on second day here the earth is having water but the upper water , the earth is made by 24 hours 12 hours day and 12 hours night but to know sky water actually while creation God added.2 more means 3 planets or something like this that these are the numbers 10 and 12 for 10  is 25 or 55 and 12 is 26 as 66 each one is having the separate meaning and to tell about 10 and 12 called J and L means in Indian language water and normally where the water there must be fish so 25 is as 55 and 26 is called 12 here 5 5 12 called EEL the name of the fish the secret is after number 10 the next number is 11 and 12  is as in neumaralagi 1 is A so 10 11 12 as  J AA L means in Indian language Hindi meaning net the fishing net so we must know that there is water  and normally the place is called God place where God is sitting on the 11 the number is invisible the size is as  each one is the length is 18 and the width 12 as each 29 and 26 as called 1290 and 1260 and 1290 1260 as 49 is 9999 =36 and 46 is 6666= 24 as the same earth measurements and each number that is 11 is having the name called Jehovah and Boez means Jesus Christ see Bible ( 1Kings 7::15) and right side J  left side L the Jesus Christ and the Lucifer sitting so this is called the thrown of God and the Earth is God&#39;s threshold hold thanks

She exuded all the excitement! Loved this conversation!
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
Max was on some very good drugs at the time, and in one hell of a &#39;we&#39;re everything&#39; circle jerk.  Masergy is an old concept.  Gravity creating particles seems far fetched, and  it being conscious is absurd.  Mankind thinks it&#39;s the center of the universe, making goofy statement like &#39;we are the universe trying to understand itself, when in reality we are, in total, probably completely inconsequential.
Brian is a Gangsta!

My theory on how the earth got it&#39;s water; which I will call &quot;theory Z&quot; is that earth started out as an icy comet about the size of the moon, gets trapped in this orbit that then got bombarded by rocks and other debris which sank into the melting ice. Besides; how can you account for the 70/30 ratio, which to me sounds absurd, that all these so-called icey comets deposited all this water????
Not so comfortable with your theory, <br>I&#39;m also studying, about it
Thank you, Dr. G. You attract the most interesting guests for the most interesting subjects. This has been one of the best. Dr. Milam is an excellent communicator with a deep knowledge of her subject. Thank you both.
Not showing us the images you are talking about really sucks
Earth&#39;s water came mostly from the Sun: protons reached Earth&#39;s oxygens and still reaching and producing water in Earth&#39;s atmosphere.
LISTEN KIDS (in short, the real world has two fields who form one particle electron=photon: magnetic is perpendicular to the plane of whirpool which produces electric field falling into that whirpool and emerging as magnetic field), THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS REVEALED IN THE YEAR 2000 (I just needed to learn English to transfer it to you): electron is photon (electron is a real atom which is a manifestation of electric and magnetic perpendicular fields like whirpool or eddy or black hole), left and right electrons form neutrino, gravity is uncompensated (or relativistic) electric field of proton (smaller particles consist of bunch of electrons and gravity there is called strong and weak force/field), proton consist of approx 2000 electrons, neutron is electron plus proton, light has no colors since it is a bunch of photons at various distances between themselves traveling in the same direction like thrown sand particles in the air, the red shift is not only due to Doppler effect, but and due to spatial dispersion both due to angular divergence and due to absorption of some photons by matter particles on the path (overall effect is red shift, like averaged distances between photons=electrons falling on averaged areas gives a sensation of frequency and color), a single photon has got no frequency. Universe is INFINITE and ETERNAL, we just cannot see (and will never be able) very deep in space since the lack of PHOTONS reaching us.
So maybe a lack of water is why life is so rare in the universe?
she is awesome
Do earth has rings?
Well my question is, does earth have rings?
Very cool.  Not sure it&#39;s $12B cool, but it&#39;s cool.
Uranus is the Greek god of the sky.
Thankyou so kind.
Of course our solar system is unique Brian, it’s the only one we know of to have life.
That doesn&#39;t mean that it is unique at all.  The thing that would make it unique, by definition, is if it were the only system where that is true, and we have no way to know, either way.  I expect that solar systems with life are literally a dime a dozen, and unlike ours some probably include intelligent life.  <br><br>I propose that ours does not, since the only species claiming to demonstrate signs of intelligence is crapping in the only kitchen it has, and maybe to the point already where the end is nigh, not today or tomorrow, but not that many  years away, either.
AWESOME !!!!!!  👾
We learn at a fast pace today one answer in Physics leads to more than a hundred questions and yes we are leap-frogging our knowledge of the Cosmos the major factor is that we have JWST to quantify what we think we are really looking at what it means to us for our future, The Cosmos is like a super colossal pinball machine things come in and things disappear in microseconds I hope what we find out is accurate enuff to help us make the major changes to our knowledge that we need to survive and maybe keep our planet Earth in the condition that helps us. I truly love the interest and comments said here.
Where did the water from mars+atmosphere go to?
Why can&#39;t i have my own planet ?
I&#39;m thinking Red Dwarf and Rimmer
When do we get to see a James Webb of earth?
We got water from Mars, and Moon is water tanker.

For Earth, Theia.
Neil DeG… Tyson is a clown and a bully sometime he wont let people finish their answers or questions.the guy is a show of narcissist.
She openly admits that they withhold data and pictures from the public. Pretty annoying.
Do we have rings around Earth such as this that are detectable with James Webb telescope ?
I don&#39;t buy the meteor theory. The debris that eventually formed earth are not as barren as you think. They&#39;re the same rocks and ice that are floating around in the solar system today. Water is simply hydrogen and oxygen. When the earth cooled down, don&#39;t you think H2O can form naturally in the surface and depths of the planet??
Nice

What are you gonna do with advising and comment go to squeeze it out of the comment and drink it?
Great video.  Thank you Dr Greene and Dr Milam.  I bet Carolyn Porco was doing cartwheels about al of these observations and especially when she saw the ring structures of Uranus and Neptune, and when she sees the other ring structures hinted at around other planets (Jupiter, etc).  Dr Porco and her colleagues pushed to get Voyager 2 to look for ring arcs around Uranus in 1987 and Neptune in the 1989.  Watch The Planets and see how inspiring and infectious Dr Porco&#39;s wonderful enthusiasm is.
Modern cosmology is a secular religion. People like Brian Greene have been Pavlovian conditioned to think circularly-reasoned illogical nonsense makes sense. You cannot reason with religious folk. The Big Bang Universe and the rest is the result of a prejudice that promotes confirmation bias over honesty. These people cling to their beliefs like good Christians from Medieval times would.

Can water be generated from its constituents via the earth formation itself?  If the earth was a super furnace and abundant with ingredients can it spew from volcanic suface interaction with its relativly cool crust? AKA can we fog the glass of our planet to bring enough mist?

If water is so important why are we allowing Fukushima Japan to dump nuclear waste into Ocean?
Because Godzilla!
Question 4: Where did the asteroids get their water from?
I have read or seen video somewhere that explaned this.The water is created in formation of stars. All starts in particle level. The birth of star and its solar system is like machine that throws out elements and in right temperature, pressure, radiation and distance from the sun if there is right building elements and usually there is you get water. Actually if we look at all these recent findings water is not so rare in universe and how could it be.😂 It is just that usually it is not in right form if we look at it from life&#39;s perspective. In the early time of formation of the star there is a sphere/distance from star where this is possible and I suppose all these rocky objects just need to fly through or be formed in this area to get water with them.<br><br>I heard that The Earth is loosing more water than getting it at the moment. Lucky us we still have relatively good amount it left.<br><br>Just let me know if this theory sounds completely wrong.😊 Actually this made me thinking when this water formation ends, is it still going on? Obviously happens somewhere but still in our solar system? Maybe too old system allready.
@@TideOfStamps sounds plausible. Thanks for taking the time to elaborate!
It wasn&#39;t that long ago we debated free choice. Maelstrom of subatomic particles do not wait for us to make a decision. The indescribable  vast brain and nerve dendrites connections give no clue to how a thought propagates meaningfully in real time (Jon Lieff MD) We are made of inorganic dust from burnt out Sun&#39;s. Ash from the interstellar clouds and cold quantum chemistry. When life dies there is really no change in the elements that make us up. There are no theories that predict life as a convergent property of the universe. If there was life would be everywhere yet we walk among a thin film of life on a horse with no name breathing an atmosphere that supports life less than five miles up. All life is inherited. Explaining everything as evolution is like understanding fire as phlogiston. AI is inheriting life from us. It may be that life requires more degrees of freedom than our universe allows never generating life once it&#39;s algorithm is broken. We only find life by comparison with ourselves. Yet follow our inherited life back through space and time and somewhere in the primordial universe our blueprint existed. Life should be everywhere or nowhere. We are discovering that we are a broken symmetry a paradox. How could the certainty of you reading this exist 13.799 billion years ago and be unscathed by inflation of the universe and supernovae? Not long ago we were writing this on leathers scrolls.
Origin of Life: no more answers than in the 80&#39;s. Still more questions than answers. I won&#39;t call the title Click BAIT, but just be clear. The theories and stories of the origin of life have not changed in 40 years.
Great Video thanks for sharing!
Brian Greene is one of my favourite physicists, not just for his obvious brilliance, but also because of his entire approach to the subject. You&#39;ll never hear him disparage others, and he has a healthy amount of respect even for non-scientists. Consider the way he engages with this other brilliant physicist: Stefanie Milam. Unlike, say, Lawrence Kraus or Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he actually allows the guest to speak. All of which leaves you thinking you&#39;ve learned something, even if you haven&#39;t:)
He probably isn&#39;t among the very top thinkers in his choice of science, but he is a great communicator and intermediator/moderator and thus he has found his role in science - to communicate scientific progress in an up to date fashion to laymen and academics alike. He is so darned amicable and he can keep focus even after careful listening to what the other persons have to say. He doesn&#39;t interrupt and he most often follows up on what the other persons are saying instead of statingly going back to his script. Or maybe he does, but it doesn&#39;t show. I want to listen to him. He is the right person at the right place.
@@rogerman65 Alas, I&#39;m not qualified to assess his choice of science, for I managed to leave school without ever being able to solve a single equation. So to me, anyone who can is a genius by definition.  Besides, I don&#39;t think you can have his kind of biography by being second-rate, quite aside from regularly engaging with the likes of Penrose on equal terms.
@@rogerman65 What do you mean? Physicists are unlikely to be top thinkers?
@@akpanekpo6025 You are right, he is not second rate. He is just not among the absolute top scientists. He is however among the absolute top of thinking people altogether. But who am I to tell. Except, this isn&#39;t a thesis, it&#39;s my sqribble on a Youtube-channel&#39;s comment section. I am not that great at math either, but neither am I a top scientist.
I&#39;ve discovered Neil DeGrasse Tyson is not the sharpest tack in the box after watching for years.  I have to turn away if I even hear him.  Brian Greene is awesome because he evokes child-like wonder in the rest of us.
I don&#39;t want to think I&#39;ve learned something , unless I&#39;ve actually learned something.
@@knowledgetracker Alas, I lack the knowledge to asses him as a scientist, but I doubt he&#39;s as research-active as the likes of Greene, given his non-academic position. He has of course written some books, but books (as opposed to journal articles) tend not to be peer-reviewed; so unless his are, he&#39;d not be in the same league as Greene, in my view.<br><br>But one thing is beyond doubt about Tyson: he&#39;s a loudmouth and a smart alec, who literally loves his own voice so much he never allows even his guests to finish a sentence.

I get the impression that Neil is more interested in promoting Neil, a bit like, dare I say it, Mr billions and billions himself, Carl Sagan.  If you watch Carl&#39;s show what you see more often than not is his face spanning the entire screen, and him droning on about one thing or another.  And when Neil said he didn&#39;t understand why there was microgravity on the ISS I laughed.  I&#39;m not a physicist, but rather a retired engineer, and I got one of those record scratch moments when I heard that.  The answer is pretty much first year physics level.   <br><br>As far as Carl goes, I laughed to tears when he talked about some civilization picking up one of the Voyager probes, like it would be more likely that they would find some car sized dead as a nail hunk of junk than say maybe our RF transmissions.  Just dumber than a stump, and brilliant, all at the same time. <br><br>And don&#39;t even get me started on that stupid Drake equation.  As a notional tool to open the thinking I have no problem with it, as an equation to explain why we don&#39;t hear from anybody when we &#39;should&#39;, it is just inane.  Let&#39;s see, let me pull a set of parameters based on wild guesses out of my butt, add them together, and get something useful...good luck with that.   IMO, managing the 10k year span of a technical civilization they used (IIRC) is beyond ludicrous, looking at where we seem to be heading right now, destroying the only spaceship we have to support our existence.  @@knowledgetracker

@@akpanekpo6025 u mm no none, since Hawking, seems to engage Penrose on equal terms. I saw Hossenfelder take on Penrose but I don&#39;t have the equipment to know if she can match him. My prejudice is that if you can find time to make popular science videos he you are not a first rate nutty professor. Or maybe she just wants to improve on an academic&#39;s earnings
@@vvanderer You don&#39;t have to have &quot;the equipment&quot; to know whether two scientists are an intellectual match. All you need is the ability to follow the discussion (which can be hard or even impossible for non-scientists, I concede), and you can tell when a punch is being landed, so to speak. For example, in a debate about Penrose&#39;s conformal cyclic cosmology, I recall Hossenfelder pointing out that because it&#39;s unfalsifiable, it&#39;s not a scientific theory even though it&#39;s supported by maths - and like Pentose, she&#39;s a serious mathematician. (For what it&#39;s worth, I watched her eviscerate Eric Weinstein too - no, I don&#39;t like that aspect f her personality either.)<br><br>As for her YouTube videos, no insult intended, but you misunderstand the nature of her chosen field: theoretical physics. For as Pentose himself once explained in response to an interview question (about what he actually does, day-to-day), &quot;all you need is a piece of chalk&quot;. In other words, because your work mainly involves mathematical calculations, you don&#39;t need to spend any time in a lab or behind a telescope, to do serious research. Note, in any event, that Hossenfelder isn&#39;t an academic but primarily a researcher (and like Penrose, with PhD candidates to supervise, though Penrose held an academic post), a position she can&#39;t hold without being research-active. By her own account, her videos are her way of escaping from the intensity of her research.
@akpanekpo6025  I will defend to the death my profession of scientific ineptitude.and yes, researcher. I conflate because her job is what  most academics regard as the main task, adding to the  corpus of knowledge, supervising doctoral candidates etc. But I do holdthat true brainiacs don&#39;t have room for anything  else
@@vvanderer Newton famously spent more time doing alchemy (and certainly published more in that area) than in physics and maths. Not to mention the distractions of his politics and religious faith. <br><br>Lemaitre was famously a Catholic priest who merely dabbled in theoretical physics. Yet that didn&#39;t prevent him from being the first to propose an expanding universe (later confirmed by Hubble&#39;s observations). <br><br>Feynman probably spent more time with women (and playing his bongo drums) than  doing theoretical physics. And, didn&#39;t he enrol for a biology degree while at it? Yet, who&#39;d ever doubted his contributions to the subject?
@akpanekpo6025  T rue.  Newton was one of a kind .Lemaitre had an insight. Feynman was also one of a kind. I&#39;m not convinced that Hossenfelder is in that class. Hawking was, Penrose seems to be. I li ke the fact he is prepared to be wrong.  And I&#39;m prepared to be wrong too. But I&#39;m not convinced... yet?...  about Hossenfelder.  I suppose I&#39;m  going  by reputation. I&#39;m certainly not qualified to judge her work.
@@vvanderer You say &quot;I&#39;m certainly not qualified to judge her work&quot;. I wonder what you&#39;d write if you considered yourself qualified to do so.<br><br>Look, I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s suggesting she&#39;s a Newton or Feynman, not least given how new she is to the trade. But she&#39;s actively researching (and publishing) in at least one of the more challenging fields: superfluid dark matter (whatever that is), and regularly gives presentations to her peers at conferences, as well as engaging the leading lights in the field. You don&#39;t need to be any more knowledgeable than I am to conclude (from these alone) that she&#39;s an authority on the subject. <br><br>I&#39;ll give you the last say.
Hi, I am Shon Mardani, this is my Unifying Theory Of Everything. I have more to fill in between the lines once I validate the fundamentals of my hypostasis, Please let me know if you see any conflict with Observed Facts, Thank you.<br><br>[GOD] Created NOTHING, a Void Point in Space.<br>NOTHING Attracts [neighboring] Space as the Only Law of The Nature which gave NOTHING its Property to be the GRAVITATIONAL PARTICLE (GP). <br>Fast Moving Space into GP,  Creates its own GP at the [Vacated] Space which Attracts the Surrounding Space which is a Negative Pressure or PULLING/SUCKING IN of a GP on Neighboring Space.  <br>There are 3 Pairs of 2 Directional Possible Movement Axis, this Creates Magic Numbers of the Nature, Numbers 2, 3 and their Sum 5.<br>Propagation of the GPs in a Closed Cyclic Patterns / Locked Loops of GPs Create Collection of Virtual Positions in Space known as Atom, Starting with Hydrogen to EVERYTHING else.<br>Atoms are Connected by Overlapping/Common/Shared (single, double bonds ...) GPs to Create Molecules.<br>Hydrogen Atoms Virtually/Positionally Collect to Form Nitrogen and Oxygen Atoms and Form the Atmosphere, in a 4 Nitrogen to 1 Oxygen ratio which I call one ATMOSPHERIC UNIT (AU).<br>Movement of GP toward the Center of the Gravity Transforms 2 AUs (2(N4O1)) into 6 Carbon with H2O as Hydrogen Transformer and CO2 as State Transformer, the Collection of this Cyclic Process is called LIFE. <br>LIFE Synthesizes the Heavier Organic Elements to Create Species of Independent Life Cycles.<br>Overlapping Fundamental Atoms Create Heavier Atoms/Elements which are collected in the Periodic Table.<br><br>The [Virtual] Movement/Propagation of GPs in a Circular Patterns within the Connected Atoms has Frequency and Direction which Constitute and are Observed as its Weight/Mass/Gravity, Force, Polarity, Magnetism, Electricity, Heat, Light, Color and ALL other Physical Properties and they Move and Interact by Connectivity.<br><br>The Gravity Force we Experience on the Earth, Is the Flow of GPs through Matter Moving Perpendicular to the Surface of the Earth towards the Center of the Gravity of the Earth and all Matter Connected to it, like being under the rain from a Firehose.

One of 6 possible adjacent Marbles can move in and fill the empty space, the one on the left, right, front, back, above or below. If the Marbles move into the empty spaces at the Ultimate Speed in Nature, the traces of the MOVING/PROPAGATING GPs (empty spaces) will look like a Spiral. Hydrogen [Matter] is OVERLAPPING GPs. <br><br>Imagine the Light Sources like Sun, Light Bulb and LEDs are NOT Ejecting Photons but they SUCK IN the GPs which we see and call them Photons.<br>Turbines convert the Gravity Force to Magnetic &gt; Electrical &gt; Heat &gt; Light and everything in between, all different manifestations of the GP [Virtual] Moving in the Matter...
I agree Brian is knowledgeable on multiple subjects and areas, I could listen to him all day long.
Water is vital... but so are you.  Thanks for the video.
I feel like earth was just a ball of ice in the beginning, and once it got struck by a huge rock like asteroid it gave us the material needed . <br>Because the amount of water here is just crazy to think it came like buckets of water filling a pool. <br>I’d say the pool was already full, then it got floaties and other things added or thrown in. <br><br>My opinion anyways.
I don&#39;t understand, so the Brownian motion velocity of the original water molecules was greater than 7 miles/sec?  That&#39;s how hot the Earth was?  Can someone do a calculation for that?
I hope he got some sleep.
Can we meet the Gods halfway? Obviously, the purpose of science is to find out HOW this dang solar system formed. I am not insinuating that we wave our hands and say &quot;The Gods did it all,&quot; nor am I saying the answers can be found in studying matter harder. I am thinking here of the old trope that this Universe is on a computer in an Alien teenager&#39;s basement, and this leads conclusively to the fact that there was a PROCESS that all these planets accumulated their constituents. Some big machine put the planets in orbit? And this machine disintegrated after doing its job? What I propose is that, due to the overwhelming size of mystery in each of our eight planets, we must assume something out of the ordinary. Something that is not JUST GRAVITY AND MATTER doing its thing, but something MYSTERIOUS. Can we at least put pins into mysteries like why galaxies are different from solar systems (dark matter), why some planets have rings, why the moons of planets don&#39;t have moons, where all this dang water came from on Earth alone, etc. etc. etc. I propose perhaps we let just a little metaphysics into the physics conversation. Would it be so bad to be a semi-atheist for once?<br><br>&quot;Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.&quot; -- Albert Einstein

very excited for what the future discoveries will hold for us.
Just like the shaft is cooled to produce force in Nuclear Plants. The oort cloud is a possibility of having metals and water in asteroids revolving due to Sun&#39;s Gravity so create a spherical band of metal and water. The direction the asteroids in the OORT cloud move, the electromagnetic flux produced by the moving asteroids is stabilized to create a field, that shuns outside Solar System Radiation. That is why water is required.
Happy FRIDAY ~ 😇

That CAN  be as mundane as doing a rich liquid fart. You get a warm feeling and a strange expression on your face, but no one knows  why.

are we atoms?
PEOPLE don&#39;t realize that a peaceful direct interaction with Extraterrestrial civilizations that are already all over our skies will be the most important event in the history of humanity because they know  things that it will take us maybe thousands of years of research and experiments to adquiere by ourselves! But because the governments and their propaganda machines keep the %99 of humanity in deep ignorance about the most relevant and important themes for humanity future survival because humans don&#39;t even know how to thing with logic and reason is that today the majority of people still asking if extraterrestrials exist? OMG that is so frustrating
If a scientific team with today&#39;s technological equipment could travel to Roman times . <br>And these scientists TOLD the people of that time that there is something called ELECTROMAGNETISM. 😊Those people would tell them that they are crazy, they would make fun of them because obviously at that time there was no scientific progress or knowledge to know and prove the existence of ELECTROMAGNETISM. 😊<br>The same situation It happens today with our scientists, because human scientist don&#39;t know nothing about it the Espiritual(ETHERIC) Dimensional Plane of Reality Existence, which is the 4D, because they don&#39;t know nothing about and they don&#39;t have the level of technology necessary to tap into it, because of that they don&#39;t want to believe or even talk about it, 😊ITS EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION as the example with the Roman&#39;s.
The question isn&#39;t where did the water come from....but where did the oxygen come from as it is the more complicated rarer atom. We need to back to epochs with fungus only for answer.

As long as these the human being continues to use the wrong science will never achieve really relevant advances in all aspects,<br>True science the correct science that can explain everything that happens in the universe is HYPERDIMENSIONAL SCIENCE, <br>👉 THE KNOWN UNIVERSE by humans It&#39;s just the tiny part of the entire UNIVERSE that its poor technology allows them to see. <br>It&#39;s just like to see a grain of sand on a gigantic infinite beach. What they explain to us is that the poor technology of the human being can only allow us to see a very tiny part of what the entire universe as a whole really is and that is because the whole universe is Organized by parts and Dimensional Planes Realms of Existence Reality this means that what the human known universe is only the very very tiny part of the Universe that exist in a 3D Space and Time physical reality, the laws of physics that humans have in the Know universe apply only to this tiny part of the universe, let&#39;s say that our KNOWN REALITY UNIVERSE is <br>-Stage  1 part of the universe,  <br>-Stage 2 part of the Universe have a complete different Laws Because obviously matter no longer exists as in our physical reality.

Great discussion
Copied from my last night comments and happy to watch this tonight. I went to school without laboratory <br><br>I don&#39;t consider myself a science because I am not. And I don&#39;t want even to make efforts to acquire titles attached with my name because that is gonna create personal actualization which is a big cause of many human faults as it creates higher expectations from other people and that person who holds those titles tries to defend them by all costs whether in political or in business instead of acting and interacting with people as a normal human being who makes mistakes, who learns new things, who doesn&#39;t know many of the things who accepts and admits faults honestly, who asks forgiveness when they hurt others and compensate others if they did anything bad to countable (physical) by actions and regrets and apologizes when they hurt others in words and make much effort in self discipline of never hurting any one intentionally but that is not passive quality and weakness. Who doesn&#39;t regret and doesn&#39;t hesitate to denounce horrible acts including theirs first and then other people&#39;s <br><br>This topic of food security was well addressed which when lacked creates &quot;food insecurity&quot;<br><br><br>But quite different topic,  I often hear climate change and climate justice and that countries most affected by climate crisis are the poorest.<br><br>I also hear carbon dioxide (CO2) discussed which is the gasses animal breath out (exhalation process) and plants take. Ok.<br><br>We also know that carbon monoxide is (meaning carbon with single oxygen at molecule level) reaction of two elements at gas state (substance state .... solid .... liquid and gas). Ok. This state is always due to the level of temperature (0 degree is the center) above 0 degree is hot or + and below is cold at substance level not human level because water is the center or queen measurement used at classification with the temperature so 0 deg is the freezing (ice point of water) which is two elements of hydrogen and one element of oxygen at molecule level or you can forgive me and say two atoms and one atom at this level because element is made up of atoms. Ok. <br><br>Carbon monoxide needs more chemical reactions and that is why it takes one more oxygen to become stable at the electrons +- (loosing and gaining between the elements in reaction) gases which are usually in the category of the periodic table in chemistry depending on the electrons cycle in outer layer with the atoms to create elements and between the chemicals (with other elements to create molecules). <br><br>First, carbon is eating the oxygen usually present in the lower atmosphere as gas. I said as a gas because with water it needs process to purity from it. Ok. <br><br>When temperature of the earth goes up, snows will heat up and make rivers to follow to the seas because sea level is the lowest of the earth and that why altitude is measured from the sea level.<br><br>Can we imagine the level of effects of such water follow not only in erosion but also every thing else. We can even bear in rain floods. But I hope, I am wrong and the solid snow oceans, seas and on lands are already in the sea level and will not make any water follow.

This is my hypothesis. The enigmatic nature of black holes and solving the information paradox. In this theoretical framework, the photon sphere of the black hole acts as a &quot;white hole&quot; emitting information in the form of Hawking radiation. This emitted radiation, being a quantum state vector, imprints onto the holographic screen surrounding the black hole as a lattice of qubits or &quot;Plixels.&quot;<br><br>The lattice of qubits represents the encoded quantum information about the properties and characteristics of objects that have fallen into the black hole. The mathematical information contained in this quantum state vector describes various attributes, including velocity, acceleration, and the probability of spin states.<br><br>This novel approach hints at a new type of physics that explores the relationship between black holes, quantum mechanics, and information theory. The idea of a holographic universe, programmed with bits of light in the form of Hawking radiation and encoded onto the lattice of qubits, holds the potential to unveil profound insights into the fundamental workings of our universe.
