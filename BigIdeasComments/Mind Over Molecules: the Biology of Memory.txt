Just thinking, how shocked and ecstatic Einstein would have gotten if he was alive to truly witness the discovery of black holes. Especially when they regarded it as not realistic even when the math worked out

Really now? You speak about science (theory, experiment, proof) while all you do is theory and visualizations.
If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>‚ÄúThe greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚ÜìŒ± is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?
Amazing
My bad
Oh
Enjoyable
20 dishes? That&#39;s a lot of washing up.
Congratulations üî≠ü™ê‚ú®
And when i started thinking and seeeing SCIENCE  related VIDEOS then  i don&#39;t see time . <br>I forget everything infront of this .
Physics is just amazing so so Amazing Every time when i think about physics,it blows up my mind This universe is so mysterious  really.
I&#39;m more convinced with Andrea Ghez data than his subjective impression of the radio data even though he obviously wants to take the credit of discovering black holes in galaxies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=923">15:23</a> No high speed internet on the planet beats out a 747 filled with hard drives?? Scuse me?
Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Brian Greene is a Genius!
Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!üëèüëèüëè<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.
An Object Falls Due To Said Object Being More Dense Than The Space Around It. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH, &quot;Gravity&quot; üòÜ
&quot;Gravity&quot; Is A THEORY And Does... Not... Exist. You&#39;re Welcome.
Love that he wears a pin with the image of the black hole on
Boring
If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! üëè
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name
Not a  pic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=660">11:00</a>
The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I‚Äôd give you one thousand dishes. Brian‚Äôs a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.
Omg even Greene is saying that new habit people are doing in spoken language‚Ä¶. ‚Äòright?‚Äù After every four words
I miss the discussion panel though üò¢
Essentially, he simulated a Solar Eclipse on a Black Hole instead of the Sun in order to get a picture of itü§ì
Fantastic lecture and looking forward to the next discoveries maybe to be developed to better and peaceful species !
How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind
Hahaha black holes üï≥
Fucking Democrats ruined World Science Festival by banning live audience.
Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?
Black holes don&#39;t exist
What if we are a experiment by advanced human civilization that set us out here to see how we would advance or how long it would take us to figure out the universe
I love living in these awakening times where technology has overtaken the lies we‚Äôve been indoctrinated with! which has closed most peoples minds ‚ô•Ô∏èüòé<br>The legendary Nikon P 900 camera with phenomenal zoom shows us why that little star twinkle twinkles and so much more but look on YouTube for ‚Äò Mars Nikon P 900‚Äò and realise fElony Musk can‚Äôt shoot his load to a luminary in our sky! <br>Betelgeuse Nikon P 900 is a strange one but have a look for any light in the sky like Saturn with what looks like it could have a total ring around it which our minds perceive to be true üòâ<br>If the lights we see are just that then the rest of the supposed universe is up for debate üòÜ<br>Black holes? Nah!
Not only is the guest intelligent but so is the host!
The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different
I can&#39;t believe I sat through an hour interview about a blurry blackhole picture, and enjoyed every moment of it.
Please share with other people my two brief videos. Thanks!!
Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.

That&#39;s not an actual picture of our black hole now is it it&#39;s computer rendition of it isn&#39;t it
So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right
Believe I am &quot;black holed&quot; out.  Next topic. ; maybe how to get from a to b w/o getting shot by a felon they just caught and released two minutes ago.  Defund the Democrats  and save the world.
Okay that explains those black holes but how do you get a device IP address into a black hole device status how does that happen this is a real question
What is the first thing they say about a black hole? Answer not even light can escape the gravity of a black hole!!! They are conducting themselves again!!!

Want to see them at kids scales since there a magnetic strand to mass you can see them with magnet iron or new neodymium if you split them there bind by a atomic particle line if you watch on YouTube or if you have the material you may see the very centre and on old bar magnet if you get the iron fine and just right from the top poles out you can see the second hole and at the very centre a small bend at the very centre I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like a transformer air gap or impurities at the join but I&#39;ve repeated this with new N42 neodymium and a rubber to hold them apart the magnetic field interaction with the fabric feild interact if you get it just right also showing a gauze line to the material magnet and a bind at the centre you can check there safe!.

I don&#39;t know about you but I find it very exciting to think of what&#39;s to come in the future; close-up photos, videos, more data on size, etc ! The only painful thing is that I won&#39;t be here to see most of all of that. Mortality really sucks the big one sometimes !
I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.
Enjoyed that largely because I could understand it, and that is down to the language employed and the presentation ,an absolutely fantastic show.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus. I also believe they know this and plan on jumping because they know earth will move out the goldilocks zone and Venus in. Yea I know it&#39;s crazy but adds up. Call me Noah ü§£
How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.
If we use Newton&#39;s language and time is only a parameter, how close can we describe the unescapable force of the event horizon? <br><br>We don&#39;t have space turning to time, instead we need to assume what? Do things just disappear from the universe disobeying thermodynamics, or is it just fuzzy-math-really-really-super-strong?
Is there some way to see those four different renders that each team came up with, for m87?
A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking‚Ä¶ once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can‚Äôt control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can‚Äôt control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you‚Äôre still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there‚Äôs a gravity-like force that‚Äôs infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can‚Äôt stay in any one moment in time and can‚Äôt move through time‚Ä¶ Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.  But I seem to remember that there was a threshold size that when reached would initiate the beginning of a black hole&#39;s evaporation. Anyway, I would like to see a video about the life span of black holes.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me.

From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.

Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.

@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = Œº/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I love learning that they&#39;ve been able to use data from multiple telescopes across the world to create higher resolution information than any one of the telescopes can alone. Interferometry has been used for many years at the Very Large Array telescope in western New Mexico. I&#39;m happy to hear that similar technology has been expanded to encompass the world. I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

lateral thinkers don&#39;t fit into your sequence. lateral thinkers are important to science and technology and problem solving/progress in general
@@mehridin Absolutely. Although at times I have difficulty explaining my thought process to the majority of linear thinkers (not derogatorily used here) and I notice that it is conversely true too, they have difficulty either understanding or transferring their information to me. My fuzzy logic is difficult to translate, and most of lateral thinkers and visual thinkers have their own version so there is hardly any consistent way to learn or translate. Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to. Occupational hazard of being a lateral/visual thinker.

Cygnus X1 is probably the nearest BH ,about 6000 LY from Earth.
The gravitational pull is proportional to the mass of a given black hole, just like any other stellar bodies.. e.g. if our sun becomes a black hole, which it won&#39;t, the orbits of our planets won&#39;t get affected.

Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
‚àÜ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question üß©
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !

You Cannot have pressurization of a gas next to a vacuum without that gas fully expanding into and filling that available volume due to entropy in an open system as your globe model claims. If &quot;space&quot; were a vacuum, that gas would have been gone and you would have suffocated long ago. We have a gradient. You can Only have a gradient of gas in a closed system, otherwise, yep.. as above, that gas would have to expand into and fill that available volume and you would be dead. We live in a closed system with a gradient because we have pressurization. All experiments prove this via the scientific method. <br><br>Now Mr. after reading this you still think I&#39;m wrong.. go ahead and Prove the globe claims of gas forming a sphere in a vacuum and Earth having air that fails to fully equalize with the vacuum around it via the scientific method. I want you to name the IV, DV, give me the Hypothesis, Null Hypothesis and show me the experiment that validates your hypothesis.

‚ùìrecycles the universe
Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy

Really now? You speak about science (theory, experiment, proof) while all you do is theory and visualizations.
If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>‚ÄúThe greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚ÜìŒ± is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2.

Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>‚ÄúThe equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚Üë‚Üì0Œ± is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?
Amazing

Oh

And when i started thinking and seeeing SCIENCE  related VIDEOS then  i don&#39;t see time . <br>I forget everything infront of this .
Physics is just amazing so so Amazing Every time when i think about physics,it blows up my mind This universe is so mysterious  really.
I&#39;m more convinced with Andrea Ghez data than his subjective impression of the radio data even though he obviously wants to take the credit of discovering black holes in galaxies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=923">15:23</a> No high speed internet on the planet beats out a 747 filled with hard drives?? Scuse me?
Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Brian Greene is a Genius!
Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!üëèüëèüëè<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.
An Object Falls Due To Said Object Being More Dense Than The Space Around It. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH, &quot;Gravity&quot; üòÜ
&quot;Gravity&quot; Is A THEORY And Does... Not... Exist. You&#39;re Welcome.
Love that he wears a pin with the image of the black hole on
Boring
If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! üëè
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name
Not a  pic at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=660">11:00</a>
The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I‚Äôd give you one thousand dishes. Brian‚Äôs a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.
Omg even Greene is saying that new habit people are doing in spoken language‚Ä¶. ‚Äòright?‚Äù After every four words
I miss the discussion panel though üò¢
Essentially, he simulated a Solar Eclipse on a Black Hole instead of the Sun in order to get a picture of itü§ì
Fantastic lecture and looking forward to the next discoveries maybe to be developed to better and peaceful species !
How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind
Hahaha black holes üï≥
Fucking Democrats ruined World Science Festival by banning live audience.
Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?
Black holes don&#39;t exist
What if we are a experiment by advanced human civilization that set us out here to see how we would advance or how long it would take us to figure out the universe

Nah!
Not only is the guest intelligent but so is the host!
The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different
I can&#39;t believe I sat through an hour interview about a blurry blackhole picture, and enjoyed every moment of it.
Please share with other people my two brief videos. Thanks!!
Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.

So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right

Okay that explains those black holes but how do you get a device IP address into a black hole device status how does that happen this is a real question

Want to see them at kids scales since there a magnetic strand to mass you can see them with magnet iron or new neodymium if you split them there bind by a atomic particle line if you watch on YouTube or if you have the material you may see the very centre and on old bar magnet if you get the iron fine and just right from the top poles out you can see the second hole and at the very centre a small bend at the very centre I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like a transformer air gap or impurities at the join but I&#39;ve repeated this with new N42 neodymium and a rubber to hold them apart the magnetic field interaction with the fabric feild interact if you get it just right also showing a gauze line to the material magnet and a bind at the centre you can check there safe!.

I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus.

How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.

A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

The more I hear about the &quot;chicken &amp; egg&quot; co-evolution of black holes &amp; galactic formation, the less I see a need for some invisible hand that &quot;holds&quot; stars &amp; galactic structures together.... not the least because the latter has such a disregard for the majesty of GR itself (which is that the distortion of space-time is a direct function of mass/energy itself.. with black holes &amp; the Big Bang themselves being a set of very specific categorical examples, even if GR itself breaks down in the jurisdictions of both phenomena). <br><br>I think from good ole Fritz Zwicky on down to the current crop of post doc &quot;dark matter&quot; hunters... everyone needs to just take a little break from their relentless and, very likely, futile hunt for that invisible particle. <br><br>What they attributed to Mr. Invisible --- a &quot;particle&quot; that must be at least as indifferent to baryon but is even more ubiquitous that isn&#39;t anywhere to be found, in reality (likely because it doesn&#39;t exist) --- may just be a natural by-product of large structural phenomena.

The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking‚Ä¶ once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can‚Äôt control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can‚Äôt control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you‚Äôre still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there‚Äôs a gravity-like force that‚Äôs infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can‚Äôt stay in any one moment in time and can‚Äôt move through time‚Ä¶ Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.  But I seem to remember that there was a threshold size that when reached would initiate the beginning of a black hole&#39;s evaporation. Anyway, I would like to see a video about the life span of black holes.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me.

Sad to see Brian Greene growing old üò¢
Fantastic interview! Great questions. Great guest. Great topic. Thank you!
And what we see is actually maybe a moment  millions of years ago what about it now?
I like the metepher a hundred years handshake with Einstein or other scientists to discuss ideas
It&#39;s a great work! But how can you assure that what you see from the radio telescope is a real black hole?
From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.
This made me cry tears of joy. Humanity is so amazing sometimes! We found and proved something even Einstein thought was beyond possibility. ü•≤
What an insightful discussion ! impressed by the humility of the guest and sharpness of Brian&#39;s questions üëç

The EHT is truly a marvelous display of technology
Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.
Perhaps black hole is really invisible body. Among many reasons there are maybe one more. My brain can&#39;t add anything to this enormous frequent mass.

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.
@@shawns0762 <i>&quot;If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.&quot;</i><br><br>There is plenty of evidence which you cannot explain. Hint: reply to those papers in the peer-reviewed literature. Nobody cares what crackpots on youtube think.
@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = Œº/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I know this video is about the incredible achievement of seeing the unseeable but I have to do a shout out for Brian Green to be the best interviewer. Respectful, knowledgeable, patient, and inquisitive, he has a set a real high bar in terms of leading such discussions.
I love learning that they&#39;ve been able to use data from multiple telescopes across the world to create higher resolution information than any one of the telescopes can alone. Interferometry has been used for many years at the Very Large Array telescope in western New Mexico. I&#39;m happy to hear that similar technology has been expanded to encompass the world. I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

No, we&#39;re not &quot;seeing&quot; black holes in any coherent sense. It&#39;s an extrapolation from observation of effects back to a visual representation of what the efficient cause <b>could</b> be. And because we are visually fixated and biased we think of this as proof.

Other than the lateral thinkers (I think I&#39;m one but maybe I can ask you to shed a light first on what you understand them to be?) I wholeheartedly agree with you!! It indeed is amazing and gratifying!
lateral thinkers don&#39;t fit into your sequence. lateral thinkers are important to science and technology and problem solving/progress in general
@@mehridin Absolutely. Although at times I have difficulty explaining my thought process to the majority of linear thinkers (not derogatorily used here) and I notice that it is conversely true too, they have difficulty either understanding or transferring their information to me. My fuzzy logic is difficult to translate, and most of lateral thinkers and visual thinkers have their own version so there is hardly any consistent way to learn or translate. Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to. Occupational hazard of being a lateral/visual thinker.

How far away is the closest black hole? How far does it have a gravitational pull? Do we have any idea?
closest known black hole is 6000 lightyears away; and is described being about the size of an apple
@@blackrockerchic17 cool
Cygnus X1 is probably the nearest BH ,about 6000 LY from Earth.
The gravitational pull is proportional to the mass of a given black hole, just like any other stellar bodies.. e.g. if our sun becomes a black hole, which it won&#39;t, the orbits of our planets won&#39;t get affected.
closest black hole to Earth is actually about 3,000 light years away. &quot;V616 Monocerotis&quot; <br>Its gravitational pull is incredibly strong, but we don&#39;t really know much about it.

Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
‚àÜ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question üß©
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !

@@alexandrekassiantchouk1632 I agree with this. They don&#39;t exist.

@@DivergentDroid Do you know what is &quot;back of the envelope proof&quot; in science? If you do, then check one on the back cover of my book. That&#39;s a good start.
@@alexandrekassiantchouk1632 Yep, nothing but pseudoscience. Your back of the envelope proof is a rough calculation based on math theory of things that have never been shown to exist in reality and certainly do not have any mathematical values you can calculate with. You cannot reify math theory from a mans mind into reality. Einstein&#39;s ideas total garbage. Mass attracting mass, total garbage. No scientific validity for either of them yet these ideas are what your back of the envelope proof is based on. Time is a human creation which is conceptual only. It cannot be manipulated as a variable. Do you actually Think space is a vacuum with gas giants in it? Total fantasy.

He can form a Belief or he can have Knowing. You have beliefs. I know this because I have seen your videos. Knowing comes from scientific validation of cause and effect relationships. Belief comes from listening to smooth sounds propaganda such as Einstein&#39;s garbage. Belief is the enemy of knowing. It&#39;s all about what you can Prove. Can you prove such concepts as time dilation No. Can you prove the MilkyWay or lights in the sky you call gas giants exist in a vacuum? (even your assumed non empty vacuum with quantum fluctuations) No. You have a Belief Only. You entire body of work falls apart as fantasy.

If &quot;space&quot; were a vacuum, that gas would have been gone and you would have suffocated long ago. We have a gradient. You can Only have a gradient of gas in a closed system, otherwise, yep.. as above, that gas would have to expand into and fill that available volume and you would be dead. We live in a closed system with a gradient because we have pressurization.

‚ùìrecycles the universe
Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy

If a photon has no mass, how can gravity have an effect on it?
Wow, that was so incredibly interesting and so well articulated.
Shep and Brian, the key to fully understand the true nature of Black Holes is Quantum Gravity not Einstein&#39;s Classical Curvature of Spacetime Gravity which is hugely wrong. <br><br>We now have an empirical theory of Quantum Gravity- The unitary Trinity God Theory and Equations that are deeply hidden in plain sight and manifested by Quantum Gravitation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation.<br><br>Also, Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. <br><br>Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; <br><br>3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the unitary Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London.

A question around Time Travel and black holes and E=MC2 ... if it is theoretically possible to travel into the future (using a spaceship) by leaving Earth and visiting a Black Hole for a year before returning to Earth ... How much is time dilation affected by the size or massiveness of the black hole? If the black hole is super massive like Sagittarius A at the center of the Milkyway Galaxy vs a black hole 100x less massive, would time dilation at the smaller black hole be relative?

Since they imply that they are anti-Trumpers, can we also assume that they were good friends of Jeffrey Epstein?
Why is he thanking Brian for the image of the black hole? It makes no sense. What does make sense is that we have another tribal member in charge! Christians were culled out of participating in these advanced degrees by strategically placing gatekeepers in the elementary and high school faculties. Tribal members were accelerated while others were held back in order to capture the top posts for themselves! Keep this in mind when they tell you that they are the ones who were unfairly treated throughout history. Maybe their tendency to be unfair is what these societies were trying to prevent! I know that me and some of my friends were treated cruelly, just because we were racially or sexually targeted for failure. The evidence is easily researched because it was done so blatantly!

Awesome!
Decades of hard work and perseverance <br><br>Nice
Love this topic. I would have asked if we observed SgA; how could we see into the gravity well when we are located on the same plane as the centre and not above? Another question would have to do with the completeness of a 3 dimensional approach to gravity, how can you see into a black hole at all; when gravity would be pulling in from all sides which in my mind, shows a picture, not of of a donut, but a round impenetrable shroud that is pulling photons and matter into the surrounding field; everything from every angle. Lastly, I would say please get some telescope arrays on the moon!!!!
This channel should be watched in Schools all around the world.
Any subject presented by Brian Greene is always worth watching. And other than his most recent book (whilst still a great read), all the other books he has written are a MUST read if you&#39;re interested in Cosmology and have no scientific background.
Imagine a rabbit hole trek so grand, so deep, on YT, and you find yourself in it watching videos on black holes.
What a great interview...!!üëèüëèüëè<br>I think not only earth but we can put telescopes on other solar system planets like Pluto and convert the whole solar system to a massive virtual telescope to improve the resolution angle thousands times better, but of course this needs a massive funding and improved technology.
The music while you are talking is very annoying!  If I need music, I have a radio.
Just wonderful. A perfect interview. Making me proud to be human. Thanks.

If only we funded more of this vs militaries
If you enter event horizon at the speed of light, you will appear in another location in universe. However the immense gravity force will cause any mass to reappear in the size of quarks, a dark matter.
&quot;If you clean your vacuum, does that make you a vacuum cleaner? So take to it&#39;s logical conclusion that black holes make an excellent framework for mounting rear channel speakers onto potato salad. The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time because a quantum state represented by the probability distribution of air bubbles in soy sauce has been astounding and unprecedented. A more concise synopsis is difficult to imagine. Your ceiling is talking to me again, so it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down. Traditional chinese medicine is absolutely critical to changing the paradigm about species 8472. But many people miss the reasons behind it all. Obsolete magical thinking is what has been going on in the background all this time. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Fluctuations in the black hole transporter frames are unstable and are affecting the bio-neural subspace modules. Follow the science of pet messes to balance the quantum polarities.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Impartial fact checkers say...&quot;True!&quot;
&quot;Fact checks can be checked because they&#39;re checkable by checkers.&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
&quot;Do you feel lucky? Well, do you, punk? Go ahead, make my day and say something that can scientifically proven to be wrong!&quot;<br>---Albert Einstein
Why do I get the feeling that gravity inside a black hole is nothing but time-space going backwards.  Gravity is time-space going backwards.
Oh what a gift this interview was, Brian! I enjoyed it very much, I like how clear the explanations were. To the point, brilliant stuff! üëè
Dark stars is a cool name for black holes...or frozen stars that&#39;s an even cooler name

The universe is even bigger than we realize since black holes have devoured stars, planets, etc.
Jews don&#39;t like working.  That&#39;s why they make stuff like &#39;black holes&#39; up and lecture about them.
Question: Is there a point when diving into the rings that space telescopes become an imperative in that you can only seperate the dishes so far on the surface of the planet?
If it was up to me I‚Äôd give you one thousand dishes. Brian‚Äôs a cheapskate.
But this guy in 18th century said that , while there is no mass in photons. Photons have no mass right? so with his knowledge and with this no mass light, there would be no gravitational pull.<br>of course Einstein later showed that gravitational pull is not only applicable to masses I think, with gravitation being the distortion of spacetime.

How do I like this video a thousand times?
I was in grade 2, when I distinctly remembered reading a science book about the wonders of the universe, one being a black hole. At that time it was still very theoretical. Im 40 now, and through the years the theoretical turned more into a reality. But when they released these pictures for the first time, I was absolutely in shock. Something I knew for my earlier life as almost science fiction actually exists in full picture thanks to the brilliant work of this team.<br><br>I think this may be the science achievement of the decade.
The golden ratio must be at play for things like this and total solar eclipses to be so perfect.
The question I want to know is, does the event horizon occupy more volume of space or rather grow as it swallows matter
Are there stars where the emitted light escaped to a distance of several light years before being drawn back down by gravity?
This blew my mind

Small problem with Karl Schwarzchild  being shown as a British soldier (time line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtcBFlWSqGM&amp;t=1391">23:11</a> in video) in a trench in WW1.  Karl Schwarzschild, an Ashkenazi Jew was a German officer (lieutenant) in the German Army serving on the Eastern front against Russian during WW1. He died in 1916 at the age of 42 of an autoimmune disease contracted on the Russian front. Not to take anything away from the wonderful video!
He never explained what tufti meant? Is it an adjective or an anagram?

The reason there are black holes at the center of galaxies is because the black hole created the galaxy from Hawking radiation.  The webb telescope already proved there was no big bang.  The red shift caused by space dust.
gravity doesnt exist. matter is electrically charged, making it inherently magnetic. matter draws itself together. galaxies form around black holes as a result of their feeding. a natural result of matter clumping together. is there something wrong with me? it seems like it all fits together pretty intuitively. it literally explains everything. the more thats there the stronger the pull.
They should do this technique with satellite telescopes in space and make a virtual telescope way larger than earth.
I am totally entranced with these lectures.<br>Thank you.
What if Einstein was right and black holes are not real and the object we thought are black holes are completely something else that have similar properties but still different

Where is the practical purpose for all that science? Aren&#39;t you rather exploring your god delusion? And where is the consistency? &quot;An infinite number of subrings ...&quot; is allowed, but dividing 2/0 is not. Brian is a very smart and educated man! Yet he follows a track that becomes more and more remote and useless.
Our universe is inside a White Hole. The White Hole attracts the Black Holes of the galaxies of our expanding universe with its gravity. In galaxies, the gravity of the White Hole is added to the Black Hole&#39;s gravity, strengthening the integrity of the galaxy and accelerating the rotation and movement along the spiral orbit of the moving gravitational waves of stars and planets.<br>Gravity is<br>The flow of spherical spiral waves inward for the Black Hole and outward for the White Hole, which arise due to rotation and movement along the spiral. The stars in the galaxy move in spiral orbits by gravity, and the waves constantly catch up with the Black Hole, and the Black Hole falls into the White Hole, dragging all the matter of the galaxy with it.<br>Space has no beginning and no end due to mutual transformation. The White Hole attracts and absorbs the galaxies of the Universe. A vacuum zone forms and expands in the center of the Big Bang. The absorption reaches a critical level. The vacuum collapses the White Hole into one minimal particle. A new Big Bang occurs.<br>Time is closed. The White Hole is part of the Big Bang. Which consists of negative energy and information such as the Akashic Records. The White Hole creates what we call Dark Energy.

That&#39;s not an actual picture of our black hole now is it it&#39;s computer rendition of it isn&#39;t it
So big and massive that it could go black and turn itself into a black hole without going supernova and how does having a hundred grams of mass spread out over a hundred feet any less heavier to hold up than if it were coalesced into one little ball it takes up a few inches because if you put a thousand pounds on a one foot by one foot area it&#39;s just as hard to lift as a thousand pounds over 100 ft buy one foot area this might be a simple question answered but but also that means that there are some black holes that weren&#39;t created by Nova or a condensing of its mass it could be because it&#39;s a big ass Starlet got so big that the velocity to escape became greater than like creating a giant black hole maybe super massive black holes are just super massive stars that weren&#39;t condensed down into the fine point of its mass or whatever I&#39;m trying to say right

I have a problem understanding the Schwarzschild Radius :S Does Light have mass? If the answer is no, why would it be impossible to excape the gravity of a black hole? While I&#39;m thinking about this - why does gravity even curve light? Is it because of the curved space that light is traveling in? I don&#39;t get it.

The more i wonder about black holes the more i think we are in one.
Probably when a black hole absorb so much becoming to dense will end up to burst and explode creating a new galaxy, a Big Bang on a smaller scale
Probably black holes in the centre of galaxies are formed for a purpose, maybe it&#39;s a way to recycle matter from a galaxy
I think black holes are just hurricanes of a spinning universe and we are the rain, yea the sun creates the planets and Mercury will become the Moon of Venus.

How much coincidence of circumstance can we write off as, well, coincidence, before we realize that there is a type of orchestration, natural or otherwise, to life on earth? Or that life exists on earth because this region of space-time within this galaxy that this solar system and the earth therein, have occupied for billions of years is probabilistically privileged in this universe. How either of these conditions naturally operates is the question we should endeavor to discover.
Computers have adjust to let us see realistically anything we want to see.
If we use Newton&#39;s language and time is only a parameter, how close can we describe the unescapable force of the event horizon? <br><br>We don&#39;t have space turning to time, instead we need to assume what? Do things just disappear from the universe disobeying thermodynamics, or is it just fuzzy-math-really-really-super-strong?
Is there some way to see those four different renders that each team came up with, for m87?
A cannon ball at escape velocity leaves the earth but at a reduced velocity due to gravity slowing its velocity. However, light escaping a near black hole can&#39;t slow down or the speed of light would seem to be violated. How is this paradox resolved?

Seeing the unseeable, isn‚Äôt that kinda like brainwashing? Don‚Äôt pay attention to what you see, hear and feel, just believe what we‚Äôre saying, because science, hypothesis, flask, Bunsen burner!   It‚Äôs quite amazing how you can watch a science festival and hear nothing but pseudoscience. Astronomy? Cosmology? Astrophysics? Evolution? The big bull crap theory, dark matter/energy, Theoretical physics? All NOT SCIENCE. No phenomenon? No hypothesis? No freaking science and therefore not empirically true. None of them.
Haven&#39;t studied science beyond primary school, have you (rhetorical)? Deal with the evidence, and keep your uneducated gibberish to yourself. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about.
This got me thinking‚Ä¶ once information (you) enters a black hole, fundamental physics change where once inside, you can control where you are in time just how in this reality you can control where you are in space while you can‚Äôt control time nor stay in any one moment in this world just how on the inside, you can‚Äôt control where you are in space nor can you stay stationary in any one place for a given amount of time. If you‚Äôre still following along and assuming I comprehended this video correctly, this reality has gravity related to space not time. Well maybe this reality (our observable universe) is a black hole too where there‚Äôs a gravity-like force that‚Äôs infinite in retrospect to time instead of space which is why we can‚Äôt stay in any one moment in time and can‚Äôt move through time‚Ä¶ Thoughts?
And I also believe this reality is inside a black hole too because it would explain the Big Bang (or the creation of the black hole), the expansion of our universe, and dark matter that we only know exists because of how it behaves with gravity. Also if you were to add up everything in the observable universe and stick it into the black hole formula, the answer says that the space needed for our  universe to be a black hole is a space bigger than our known observable universe which is more evidence that this reality is a black hole with a gravity-like infinite force that makes it impossible for us to stay at one given moment in time and move through time itself.

According to Hawking black holes can evaporate because some photons can escape from them. But photons that &quot;escape&quot; were never really part of a black hole. And as it was explained in this video there are some photons that are swallowed up and others that are not. I don&#39;t think the ones that are swallowed up could ever escape.  But in order for a black hole to evaporate whatever it swallowed up would have to escape from it in order for the evaporation to happen. Given the size of M87 there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to how big a black hole can get or how much material it can swallow.

Black hole&#39;s effect time just like energy and matter. (Not light, no mass) We already know, it can effects time just like it effects everything it collects. If it can focus all it collects to one point, by the same thinking, black holes are focusing all that it collects into one time. Pushing (or pulling) down, INTO time. Until pieces (quantum particles, DUH) exist in past, present, and future at the same time, in time. Makes sense to me.

From deduction ... the stars orbiting the bh have specific orbits that correlate with what would be expected if there was a bh. Supercomputers calculate specifically how the orbits would be .nothing else can cause such orbits.

Great thrill to know about black holes  and I think it can explain more about the universe
If black holes are able to be formed in a very small size . Just as the large sizes . It would mean the CERN  creation of such a small black hole.  Would then allow a permanent small black hole to continue . No matter how small in scale.  The results are just as you have reported here.  And makes cern a incredibly dangerous experiment that needs to be better understood before it makes such a event that has much longer life time than a very short period of existence.
So shouldn&#39;t we be able to see the massive and extremely bright accretion discs around black holes when looking with powerful telescopes?

As a layman, please explain how we know where the center of our galaxy is?
There are a few ways that scientists have been able to determine the center of our galaxy. One way is by looking at the distribution of stars. Our galaxy is thought to have a spiral shape, with the center being a dense region of stars. Another way is by looking at the motions of gas clouds. These gas clouds tend to orbit around the center of the galaxy. Finally, scientists have also used radio waves to map out the structure of our galaxy. By looking at all of this data, scientists have been able to pinpoint the center of our galaxy to be in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.

Black hole theory is based on the misconception that General relativity predicts singularities. Einstein is known to have repeatedly said that this is not the case. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. <br>   There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated. In some sublime way that mass is all around us.<br>   Black holes were popularized by television in the 1960&#39;s and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.<br>   All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity.
Sorry, but that is total gibberish.
@@ianwhite4347 In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; Einstein wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the &quot;Schwarzchild singularities &quot; (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The &quot;Schwarzchild singularities&quot; do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   The greatest mystery in science is the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). It was recently discovered that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal rotation rates. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. There can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why can&#39;t we see light from the galactic center?&quot; The modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape. Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is partially or completely dilated relative to an Earth bound observer.<br>    Einstein&#39;s answer explains the greatest mystery in science. <br>   If you believe in black holes you believe in something that is based on a mathematical misconception, popularized by television and there is no evidence for.<br>   The notion that there is any way to take a picture of what exists at the galactic center is insane. As per relativity an observer would have to exist at or near it&#39;s momentum.
@@shawns0762 Gibberish. You haven&#39;t got a clue what you are talking about. And that 1939 Einstein paper was flawed, as Oppenheimer showed in the same year. I am not interested in the ramblings of unqualified laymen on youtube. Write a paper or be quiet.

@@ianwhite4347 It&#39;s not a matter of opinion, they don&#39;t exist, nobody believed in black holes when Einstein was alive because he would promptly explain that you have to factor in dilation. Relativity explains all the phenomenon we see and it is peer reviewed.
@@shawns0762 Yes, it is about opinion. And your opinion is wrong, due to you not understanding the physics, nor the evidence. All your hot air only exists on youtube, where you hide away, too cowardly to actually deal with the evidence in the scientific literature. You are just another youtube poser. Get an education.
@@shawns0762 Nobody was really bothered about black holes in Einstein&#39;s time. The term had not even been coined. His paper garnered no citations for a long time. As was the case with the Oppenheimer paper that showed Einstein to be wrong. One of the problems with Einstein&#39;s paper was that he put r = Œº/2.  That simply isn&#39;t the case. He has the singularity at what we now know to be the event horizon. He also thought a star would have to rotate a c to collapse into what we now know as a black hole. Again, that is not the case. Sorry, but in this case he got pwned by Oppenheimer. And later scientists agreed with him, and showed how black holes would indeed form. And now we not only have images of the shadows of them, but have seen for years the stars orbiting them, telling us their mass. And also the gravitational redshift induced on one of those stars at pericentre. It is all consistent with the existence of black holes, and totally inconsistent with Einstein&#39;s 1939 paper, which has essentially been ignored. For good reason.
@@ianwhite4347 A singularity cannot exist because of dilation, it&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates is virtual proof that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers.<br>   Black holes and dark matter do not exist, it&#39;s not a matter of opinion it&#39;s an elephant in the room. All images and data from galactic centers is in line with relativity. Relativity is not debatable.

I can&#39;t wait to see future technology increase the aperture of our telescopes to the diameter of the moon&#39;s orbit or the Earth&#39;s orbit or greater.

Rough ride, but exactly as you state, important for our species  and its progress as we cross fields, cross pollinate ideas and build new routes to new areas of any of the topics we set our mind to.

Just wondering, if a black hole has infinite mass, the singularity is virtually size-less and it distorts space and time, how can it move through space? <br>In the standard gravity well theory it should form an anchor but we see black holes move in relation to us and each other.
‚àÜ I meant infinite density
There&#39;s a lot of debate on how black holes move, but the most popular theory is that they actually don&#39;t move. Instead, it&#39;s space and time that moves around them. This is because of the immense gravitational force that black holes have. It&#39;s so strong that it actually bends space and time around the black hole. So, in a sense, the black hole is stationary while everything else moves around it.

How can gravity have an effect on light if light (photons) have no mass?
i have no clue, but it sounds like a reasonable question üß©
I&#39;m probably wrong but I like to make a fool out of myself.<br>That&#39;s the difference between Newton and Einstein.  Newton expressed the dynamics of gravity in as if gravity is a force between objects with mass.<br>Whereas Einstein expressed it in a geometry of 3D + time.   Where gravity warps, bends 3D space and time.  So even though light goes straight in space it would appear it&#39;s bend near gravity like the sun.  Because the space around the sun is warped.  <br>So when light trying travel out of the black holes it&#39;s sort of space and time themselves are warped or bent or held in sort of ... sorry, I can&#39;t articulate well enough, around the black hole at the event horizon.  Thus light is traveling straight but there&#39;s no space or time there out of the black hole, sort of way.  But it&#39;s easier to say by the escape velocity I guess.<br><br>Newton or Einstein both don&#39;t explain what gravity IS.  They&#39;re expressing gravity&#39;s dynamics or the causality.  One is as if a force and the other is in a 3D + time geometry where time and dimensions may not be universal but relative.  And Einstein expressed better than or closer to the reality we observe.  Something like that, I think.  I&#39;m sure someone else could explain better than I, though.
Photons are not massless , the rest mass is zero , not the mass in motion which is in case of light....
There&#39;s a lot that scientists still don&#39;t understand about gravity, but one of the things they do know is that it can have an effect on light. One way this happens is through something called gravitational lensing. This is when the gravity of a massive object bends the path of light that&#39;s passing by. So, even though light photons don&#39;t have mass, gravity can still have an effect on them.
Wonderful production !
I really want to attend live WSF üòÑ
This guy is Bob Saget&#39;s genius doppelganger XD
Geeeeeee What an achievement, and as time passes Einstein brilliant becomes more and more profound
He was always profound...it just took the world 100 years to realise it.
Time and light disappear beyond sight. But we don‚Äôt need time or light where we‚Äôre going. They are nothing more than shackles holding us back. Like the black hole, unshackled
good job nasa you spent 10 bil to capture an image strikingly similar to that of 500 years ago nice
I love our beautiful universe... Incredibly powerful beauty...
Great episode
I have never heard a black hole described so well
I would like to meet those who watched and commented on this vicarious journey into space time.  We need to form a watch club.

‚ùìrecycles the universe
Thank you for this interesting event! A question about super-massive black Holes at the center of galaxies: which is their possible role in the formation of a galaxy?
I&#39;ve wondered about it too- I hear it said that super-massive black holes are found at the centre of &#39;almost&#39; every galaxy, but not heard much elaboration beyond that.<br>I suppose it&#39;s an interesting question as to how these things form - I mean if you look at the accretion discs of matter piling up, unable to get in, and the relativistic jets of matter being spewed out, these things are messy eaters, like a baby with an ice-cream, only a small percentage ends up in the mouth, the rest of it just gets sprayed everywhere! So how do they get so massive in the time they&#39;ve had?
It may be that, when a region of area flattens just enough to create an immense amount of energy, the energy itself collapse inward generating an outward propagation of dark energy. I immagine that black energy, which associates with the acceleration of the expansion of the universe,  stems from that very fraction of explosion, a black hole. Therefore, it is the centre where a galaxy expandes.
It&#39;s incredible how people can be led to believe anything. For example, creating subtext for virtual human trafficking, by using current war technology for commercial peeping tom purposes.  Adding the subtext to a variety of fields let&#39;s you know how fraudulent various &quot;professional&quot; fields have become.  <br>Imagine &quot;scientists&quot; being able to trespass &amp; observe anyones privacy &amp; phrase it in their on &quot;professional&quot; jargon. Whatever it is, watch it again &amp; then see what you think of these &quot;scientists&quot;.
What came first the supermassive black hole or the galaxy

Brilliant
Maybe we need to question our idea that a big brain equates to a smarter creature.  The Shetland Sheepdog has a vary small brain compared to the Collie, but both are very intelligent dogs.
Brian Greene has what it takes to be a great interviewer ‚ù§‚ù§
I have not seen one ape turn into a human.
wow, this dude loves to hear himself talk
I read the book and enjoyed thisi  interview, can&#39;t help but notice whenBrian asks the .ost difficult questions the response doesn&#39;t address it in fact he distracts with something else. Examples are &quot;other reasons explored&quot; and &quot;why didn&#39;t anyone else notice the markings&quot;
It was so difficult for me to ease into his informal way of talking and that ridiculous cowboy hat. But it is obviously my bias because he doesn&#39;t match my inner image of a scientist
What a wind bag!
Or there were a lot more of us than there were of them. The simplest explanation often turns out to be most right.
Carefully crafted image and exaggerates all his discoveries. Don‚Äôt be fooled, read the criticism about him by fellow paleoanthropologists.
Lee Berger is a showman, and in part a huxter and charlatan. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs not a trained professional in his field, but he jumps to wild conclusions and interprets his data to fit those conclusions rather than just letting it (the data) speak for itself. I‚Äôm disappointed that he‚Äôs gotten so much of the attention he craves these past few years. Most other paleoarchaeologists resent his self-aggrandizement and his creaky anthropological conclusions. Be critical when you listen to people making big claims.
Right at the start of this is the question &quot;What set us apart from the other human species [that we shared the world with], and why did we prevail?&quot;. Was it all our especially nice qualities? - Offhand I&#39;d conjecture it was for the same reason we prevailed over all kinds of indigenous peoples and more peaceful societies and communities with weak defenses or less-advanced technologies. And that is that the stronger, greedier, and  fiercer amongst us killed them all off.
This guys ego is off the charts.I would have loved to learn about the finds and the science but i got so sick of listening to mr Bergers self love i had to stop.He could learn so much from Brian Greene. i have learned so much from Brian from many hours of his talks and not once have i heard him brag about how great he is.A key complaint in the peer reviews of Berger and his team is that they didn‚Äôt employ geoscience to support their arguments ‚Äì which are uncertain, to put it mildly.Hopefully, geoscience will be employed in the Rising Star cave system and we will one day learn the tantalizing truth about whether or not naledi and its orange-sized brain really was lighting fires and burying its dead, and possibly carving geometrical lines on cave walls ‚Äì or if that is a romantic interpretation of ancient hominins who got fatally lost in a winding, pitch-black cave and died ther
Why do so many people, especially from the U.S (or so it seems), always say ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù by default- thus omitting the country they are, in fact, referring to?
He‚Äôs braver than me, I would of never crawled in there lol
This is all hogwash. There is no definitive answer as to human evolution.
Sure there is. We may never be able to discover it, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not an answer.
What an amazing storyteller
Fantastic!   Question: Once the initial documentation is done, is it not possible/allowed to expand the size of the narrow passages?
He talks about that in the video. The geology is such that breaking off the wrong part could collapse the whole thing.
This is the worst. Half of the talk is over, and this narcissistic person is still talking about himself.
What most people do not know is that Berger&#39;s and Hawk&#39;s &quot;assertions&quot; have not stood up to peer review.  In fact, their &quot;work&quot; has been savaged by dozens of highly qualified anthropologists.  For example:  Why did Berger&#39;s team not date the fire evidence in the Naledi cave?  The assertion that funerary rituals were performed is at best a wild fantasy.  the &quot;stone tool&quot; find is nebulous.  The &quot;cave art&quot; is likewise nefarious.  Berger is the type of guy that if you invited him to dinner, you&#39;d probably find him in your daughter&#39;s bedroom.  There are so many questionable assertions made by this team that the only thing remotely elucidating about the find is the bones.  And they haven&#39;t even tried to extract DNA from the molars.
Behavior is not a question of brain size but of brain processes. My brain is literally bigger than Einstein‚Äôs, just not as good. I see no reason why these primitive ancestors could not have had burial rituals.
The human origin story is as awe inspiring and mysterious as the universe. I can‚Äôt imagine what the landscape, and how amazing the night sky must have looked! Awesome interview!

thank you for this remarkable conversation! it boggles the mind - in a good wayüôÇ
Great, amazing story!  And on top of everything else he&#39;s accomplished he&#39;s really a master storyteller!  You&#39;ll be glued to your seat!
Great presentation. I am in finance and have been driven by the same mindset. I always say: ‚ÄúNever let anyone make you believe that there is nothing else you can do to contribute or improve.‚Äù
How wonderful Lee, your teams, your children, your account of these remarkable discoveries. for getting thin and then getting in-side that tiny space then finding those carvings on the wall.  long may you continue to inspire great science and discovery,  and just so you know, I am officially adopting you, so that you can...&quot;Oh please tell me that all over again&quot;   Just brilliant and Kindest regards, Keith, Drakensberg South Africa.
Iv&#39;e watched every Lee Burger interview, lecture, movie I can find but this is the best. Maybe because Brian Greene is so good.
Hearing this stuff is extremely interesting, but seeing it is absolutely incredible!
The argument and evidence that the location of the bones was not the result of funeral or burial practices, is also available on YouTube. I think it‚Äôs only right that anyone interested should look it up.
Wow, knowledge sure is neat, huh?
what an extraordinary account of an extraordinary career of discovery:<br><br>finding his passion <br>sticking with this passion for 17 years with little to show for<br>nurturing the next generation of scientists<br>pushing open access to scarce archeological data<br>humbling of the human species<br>complicating the definition of being human<br>greatest time to explore has yet to come, the greatest time to explore is now<br><br>the list goes on...
One thing comes to mind about those small brains: size doesn&#39;t matter
The audience are morons and unappreciative. I would have been giving this guy multiple standing ovations!!
Outstanding presentation!  And discovery, Lee Berger. Thank whatever gods may be for people like you. Keep on keeping on and telling us about it.
This guy was one lucky American bastard who had the protection of the best terrorist to make these discoveries. I love this guy.
Such a brilliant mind and story teller
Thank you. It was a very interesting guest!
I always enjoy hearing this account about this astonishing discovery.
Oh wow! saw the actual cave experience before this. So amazing!
Other countries are screwed. <br>It is fake, not really a person when the camera cuts to the rear. <br>Just a matter of time though...
This might be my favorite interview ever.  I am speechless and can‚Äôt wait for further discoveries.  Thank you to everyone involved.
Thank you Brian Greene &amp; WSF for bringing those of us from other milieu and neophytes in sciences (like myself) closer to it. I am learning enormously from these talks.  ü•∞
Amazing talk!
ridiculous
Maybe the tribe hid in the cave and and couldn&#39;t get out and staved there ..
hew didnt explain why trees were next to the caves,,,
Evolution is bogus Dude it&#39;s nonsense like climate change
This might sound pedantic, but I don‚Äôt think it is. If humans and Neanderthal bred then they are not different species, because different species cannot breed. Therefore, we are the same species. <br>Back to the program.
If individuals can always produce fertile offspring, they are the same species; if never, they are different species even if they share a common origin. The problem is when fertile offspring only sometimes happen. If 99 out of 100 offspring are fertile, they are almost guaranteed to be at most subspecies; if only 1 out of 100 are fertile, virtually everyone agrees they are different species.<br><br>The problem is when the fertile offspring rate is somewhere between the 99 and the 1. Do 50/50 rates qualify as the same species? What about 70/30, in either direction?
@@Archon1995 yes, I agree. That‚Äôs why I wanted to state it because in the beginning of the video he said ‚Äúdifferent species‚Äù and that didn‚Äôt make sense to me. <br>I don‚Äôt know whether the error deviation is for us to decide scientifically or if there is a hard line between one species and another. As you stated 70/30, 50-50, etc.
Like a &quot;who done it?&quot; that you can&#39;t put down, this &quot;who is it&quot; story keeps you entranced to the last frame.  Thanks so much for taking the time for great story telling.
Curiousness is such an essential trait to have.  Encouraging that in children is the most important job in parents and teachers, it gives a yearning for something outside of ourselves and that gives one the itch to learn more. Sets a life of passion that is the spark to keep us moving forward !  Dr Berger rose to the challenges and continues to discover the lineage of man by his commitment to research and finding new technologies to find sites. And what discoveries!! So fascinating!
Just finished watching, absolutely awesome! It&#39;s 11:42 p.m., I&#39;m going out to dig in the yard right now.
OK. Almost halfway in and I&#39;ve learned NOTHING about the &quot;story of Humankind&quot;. But I know all about this guy&#39;s career. Very misleading and very uninteresting.
I&#39;m a quarter of the way in and all I&#39;ve heard about is this guy&#39;s career. Nothing about &quot;attributes that set our species apart&quot;. Very unsatisfying so far.
I had friends that were house sitting at Donald Johansan&#39;s apartment in Berkeley when he was in Africa...so my girlfriend and I visited one evening...I had no idea who Donald was, we were eating pizza in the living room...and we put in a vhs tape (National Geographic) ...about his work...and I noticed this book on the shelf...Lucy...so I bought it and it introduced me to that type of occupation...I had already read about √áatalh√∂y√ºk... I remember this moment and it was just friends spending time together...I am 64...I was 26 then...memory is amazing
Admittedly unresearched but I think we&#39;re the only creature capable of belonging to multiple groups.
Just wanna point out‚Ä¶<br>Not all DNA ‚Äúsharing‚Äù is necessarily ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù.  ü§≠
Surely even the laziest brain would not say there is nothing to find out. Look how fast things advance.
Amazing find and story. Human arrogance is amazing - why is it so unbelievable that a species with a small brain could engage in such a ritualistic or &quot;programmed&quot; behaviour of bringing their deceased to a gathering place? Just as birds migrate every year to a specific gathering place or build amazing nests...and other animals have programmed behaviours - perhaps this behaviour is programmed into the human psyche. We big-brained humans carry it on thinking it is culture when it could be something much, much deeper than that.
Awesome amazing story! Wow<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ePgfY-K2Kp6Mr8oP1oqAwAc"></a>
That&#39;s how you do an interview. Ask, shut up and listen and occasionally ask a brief question for clarification. You don&#39;t don&#39;t put your opinions out there or constantly interrupt the person when they&#39;re about to say something interesting or just start talking yourself about what you think. It&#39;s very rare to see an interview like this. Good job!
You&#39;re so right!
I agree with you 100%. On a funny note, this guest doesn‚Äôt need an interviewer just someone to keep him between a 2 hour limit. This guy could talk for hours. üòÇ
Mr Green has nothing to say because all the digging stuff CAN NOT prove or even add up to anything real other than a pile of bones... All this stuff is no better than educated guesses \ common sense other than the dates that ARE scientifically proven numbers..
a great collection of stupid s-it
Great episode!!
Roughly 50,000 generations for ever 1 million years. We have only just begun to dip our toes into the incredible story of our ancestors.
HATS OFF TO THE ONES, WHO GO INTO CAVES,INTO SEAS, ON THE CRATER OF A VOLCANOES. BRAVING THE NUMBING ICYNESS OF THE ANTARTIC. TO THE ASTRONAUTS WHO TRAVEL INTO SPACE. ONES WHO FIGHT TERROR WITHIN THEMSELVES  FOR THE REWARD OF DISCOVERY.
CASSOWARIES-THOSE LARGE NEAR FIVE FOOT BIRDS OR OSTRICH LIKE BIRDS, WHO ROAMED THE FORESTS OR PLAINS WHERE PLENTIFUL. HOW HUMANS SURVIVED IN THE FIRST MILLION YEARS IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE. WE HUMANS HAVE LEARNED TO SLAUGHTER EACH OTHER BY THE MILLIONS,YET WE DOMINATE THE EARTH. HOWEVER THE ANIMALS MENTIONED HERE ARE NEARLY EXTINCT.
HUMANS, BY THE WAY OF EVOLUTION NEEDS REVISING. IN A WORLD OF WILD ANIMALS. LIKE IN THE FIRST MILLION YEARS OF &quot;HUMAN&quot; EXISTENCE,A HUMAN NEEDS TO BE STRONG LIKE AN APE ABLE TO RUN FAST FROM WILD DOGS. HYEINAS WHO AMBUSH THIER PREY, OR LIONS LIKE BEASTS WHO HUNT IN PACKS. THESE ANIMALS WERE THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF A PERSON. MAYBE A HALF A TON OR MORE. HUMAN BABIES GROW VERY SLOWLY. WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO RUN IN TWO WEEKS OF BIRTH LIKE  FOUR FOOTED ANIMALS CAVES ARE NOT SAFE. SO THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THESE DEFICENTS AS A HUMAN. WE SHOULD BE EXTINCT. OR VERY SCARCE.
Didn&#39;t take long too bored out of my mind üòî and I know he&#39;s loving everything he&#39;s done üíØ
I think dr Berger discover the true particle of good
Sorry but, I was pretty turned off by the size of his ego. I enjoyed the subject, the science and the discoveries, but the guest made everything about himself. Everything he talked about was the ‚Äúmost important‚Äù, ‚Äúgreatest ever‚Äù etc. It was like he was trying to be a preacher or something.
my human jaw dropped...thank you!
Fantastically interesting!
HMM <br>SPOOKY <br>WHY WAS THE OTHER GUY KILLED IN UK
If you just tell the truth, the story would be about slavery of every type and kind. This is why progress is so &quot;important.&quot; We can&#39;t have people leading free, simple lives. We have to shackle their labor, their bodies, or their minds. Tribes disappear because they are free. The slavers always create problems and then compound them with their &quot;we need more money - progress.&quot; Meanwhile anyone who resists is jailed or killed. Freedom is not our story, but it is a nice story. Abolish political slavery!

Well I would say you need to do some research. This has been known for quite a while now.
Lee Burger is disrupting the traditional human story.  It‚Äôs a lot like how BEV‚Äôs are disrupting traditional automotive.  The Rising Star Cave will continue changing the science even if some of the things the papers written on it don‚Äôt pan out.
Wow.  If you don‚Äôt watch this to the end you miss the most important find.
Phenomenal!!
Humans are highly social, hyper intelligent bipedal apes. Thats the best definition my uneducated brain can muster.
It is not that hard to believe Naledi could care for their dead....just look at  how some mammals from elephants, whales, etc that grieve over a dead baby. They just didn&#39;t have appendages to perform burial rituals. Bravo!
I guess that lake Dorothy comment was for those too dumb to know the girls can do that too.
I am mostly a physics geek, and have watched many previous episodes of WSF, but this is the best program yet. Absolutely a &quot;must watch&quot; show.

Yes, yes, ≈µonderful.
nice hat
I‚Äôm loving all the coverage of this amazing discovery - I‚Äôm so glad this team are so PR savvy, we need more of this in science.
The only thing I am not sure about is why burials should be human exclusive? Don‚Äôt elephants have funerals and don‚Äôt crow bury their dead children with whole extended family participating and cowing ? I think the idea of human exclusivity and their relationship to ritual is highly just a nonsense.  Think of chimpanzees, when they running for office aka alpha male position, they hold and kiss babies from community that are totally unrelated to them.   Hypocrisy is not just human either.   Time to get over those old cliches and stereotypes
Crow? Are you talking about the bird we call a crow? They do not bury their dead. But they sometimes will gather around up in the trees or on a telephone wire and squawk.  Elephants do not have funerals, but it is true that if they come across bones of a dead elephant they will stop and pick up those bones and stay with those bones for awhile. But I would not say that is a funeral, because it is by chance that they find those bones. Scientists think they are trying to figure out what death is by picking up those bones. They do not go looking for the bones, but just come across them by chance. You know, not everything on the web is true. Learn some critical thinking skills.
@@LadyLeda2 Thank you for advice, I do critical thinking , that‚Äôs why I am against blanket statements , when we don‚Äôt know the best scientific approach is to say we don‚Äôt know. I think we are a long way to go, if we ever figure out consciousness and it‚Äôs exclusivity to humans. I don‚Äôt take someone‚Äôs opinion on it‚Äôs face value and scientific fact  . Till five years ago, art and fire were exclusive to human, now we know Neanderthal had both and the myth of human being an exclusive tool making species been long debunked.  Etc.  I don‚Äôt want to argue with you.  It is good that you know a lot   I am like Socrates, the more I know, I realize, I know nothing.  Thanks again for reply.

Background music  stop me listening your video  <br>Sorry
It&#39;s probably sacrilege to say this but for the safety of all and ease of access... why couldn&#39;t they somehow in a least invasive way to avoid a cave-in or destroy more artifacts, but to remove the tough spots to slide past to smooth out their access into the depths of this cave?  What a great venture this has been Dr. Berger and all involved with this, and all that the sciences do to clarify the mysteries of our being!
We shouldnt presume that multiple species of past human species got along just fine because we share DNA. Moodern humans cannot even get along with each other. The sharing of DNA is more likely to be rape cases. Imagine how humans treated other branches of their species given how they treat each other in todays world . The differences would have been more than just skin colour.
these carvings somehow remind me of a map with possible locations of the graves. That would explain the erasure and drawing over. Because burying at the same spot multiple bodies in such cramped space meant you need to find where the older burial spots were for which a map is desirable :D agree?
Probably something to do with burial rights or taxes.
We in a ‚Äòfalse reality‚Äô , the truth will remain distant.
To clarify and explain, it is my THEORY that every advanced human like species exterminated the previous inferior one, probably with better tool making. I do not think any human like species went naturally extinct like other species do.
What makes us human is the concious intelligence and ability and desire to exterminate the the previous &#39;human like&#39; species. Only humans want to do this to their own type. Though we are the same species now, MANY still carry that feelings deep inside.The growth of the brain DOES HAVE ITS PROBLEMS!
This guy gives me snake oil salesman vibes.
Thats why science relies on data and evidence, not feelings.
I am 74 years old now. When I was young, from about age 5 or 6, I wanted to be a paleontologist or archeologist. (Somebody gave me a dinosaur play set for Christmas. I had a book on natural history &amp; dinosaurs that was my favorite &quot;bed time story.&quot;) In high school my parents &amp; teachers convinced me that there was no future in either since everything had been discovered. (We had King Tut&#39;s tomb &amp; T-Rex &amp; Brontosaurus. What else was there to discover?) I graduated high school in 1967. Lots of interesting things have been discovered, in both fields, since then. I worked in insurance &amp; reinsurance most of my life and often found myself digging into the history of those subjects.<br>Here you have one of the greatest discoveries ever: an improbable human species from before there were humans!

What? Do not understand a thing you said. Do you speak English?
What a nonsensical fantasy. Not everything said by scientists is scientific. Dr John Lennox
Maybe they were hiding from larger hominids that were out to kill them. Everyone crawled into these hidey places and then died of hydration and starvation.
I am still convinced they got stuck inside the cave and couldnt get out..
Greene is such a good interviewer. He draws great explanations from guests outside of his own field of expertise.
So the bodies of these hominids were either deposited by other living hominids or living hominids deposited themselves, as in sick individuals who went into a cave to die? <br>I&#39;m inclined to believe the latter based on the difficulty of entering the cave and moving a corpse down through the chamber.<br>I&#39;m also aware of whales and elephants going to particular places to die thereby creating burial sites.
What a great storyteller!!

What a fabulous interview!
When Prof Berger talked about his crawling through the chute, I involuntarily cursed out loud
This is wonderful!
Amazing discovery--those early 1970&#39;s chairs!
Looking at that cave entrance I can why there were bones.   They were chased down there ... getting hunted by something SCARY AF.  It makes more sense that they were scared out of their minds seeking ANY SORT OF REFUGE !!!!
... although they were tiny little buggers. so maybe.
I think you need to watch this video again and pay attention more. They did tons of research because they themselves had a hard time believing that this species actually were putting their dead down into this cave. In the end, that was the only conclusion. Mr. Berger talks more about that in other earlier interviews he has done.
Mind blowing . I&#39;m the type that always tries to stand outside the box and look in , like Lee Berger and Brian Greene seem to be . From outside the box looking in I can&#39;t help but wonder if this is why we haven&#39;t found THE MISSING LINK . I know theres theories that try to fill it in . I&#39;ve even as a kid seen the iceman personally at a museum,  i was young but i think it was the New York Metropolitan.  But even he never quite struck me as a MISSING LINK . We keep finding all these different hominoids but this one seems to show show aspects of many different ones . Maybe the missing link is actually the convergence of multiple hominids,  including ours and Neanderthal,  interbreeding ? Maybe the breeding of humans is more like that of dogs than most people are willing to accept . ü§î

When he saw those etchings in black light and when he went down on his knees and saw the &#39;hashtag&#39;, the moment of realization... I can imagine what that moment must have felt like. This talk is so damn inspiring. Thank you.
sadly he had to equivocate about what it was like for him claiming it was probably this physical phenomena and that physical phenomena that made him feel like he was having an intense spiritual experience.  I hope someday people don&#39;t feel like they have to hide those experiences in order to be &quot;scientists.&quot;  But, yep, to your point -- just try to imagine that moment!!  Thrilling!
they keep rewriting the same story over and over and over again. And they still don&#39;t get it right.<br>However mainstream science is still at the same rat-game of &quot;breathtaking developments&quot; as if it was a some hollytrash movie.<br>We might as well ask Chat GPT instead of the experts who basically remain within their expertise and nothing else much.
Remaining in your field of study is what makes you an expert.
Absolutely fascinating and captivating to this 67 year old former science/engineering student and geek. It&#39;s stuff like this that keeps my mind and inspiration young and vibrant, and recharges my spirituality ( not in the religious sense). <br>(I think <b>PBS&#39;</b> <i>NOVA</i> , or some other PBS presentation aired a film about this expedition, if my memory serves me correctly, within the past 5-7 (?) years.)<br>And kudos always to <b>_World Science Festival. _</b> It&#39;s great to see so many science sources carried on You Tube.
This has become my favorite story of adventure and scientific discovery even beyond the moon landing. What a privilege to have been a part of this. I would have given up a lot to be there, but I would never fit into those caves.  I&#39;m really grateful to all who did the job, of making it possible for all of us could see this take place.
I‚Äôve seen or read a lot of Dr. Berger work, but I never heard his life story before. He‚Äôs a fascinating character.
He definitely is interesting. I listened to many of the University lecture series and have seen dr. Berger quite a few times. But Bruce Green allowed him to tell so much more

Well, quantum science has taught us that consciousness doesn&#39;t reside in the brain...
Nope it hasn&#39;t.
Well not in your brain !
This is really fascinating to learn about. I still wonder if these proto humans actually practiced burial and writing themselves. <br>Given the time period these creatures died and were buried in this cave still corresponds with modern human existence, it is possible that our human ancestors were the ones who buried these creatures in this cave, not the creatures themselves. <br>Humans have buried animals for thousands of years, just like we bury our pets today. <br>I imagine some of our ancient ancestors might of lived in cohabitation with these proto humans for a long long time and even adopted them into their civilization like we do with our favorite animals. It seems totally normal that we&#39;d bury them like one of our own.
My thoughts too
In that case they would have been dinner.

This is super emotional for me, even bigger than the first time I looked at what was found in Rising Star Cave. This ties all the ends of this exploration thanks to this human. These are not human, these people are pre human. Same with our new ai. It is not human, will never be human, no matter if it wished to be, it will not be us.

We know almost nothing about our genome. We know a few the most basic proteins out of MILLIONS of folded DNA . Saying we see commonalities is nothing more than seeing the most basic and gross organizations  common in vertebrates.  And then there&#39;s cell biology. And I dont appreciate archeologists etc building plastic models around one bone,  or the flawed method of carbon dating.
We know everything about our genome that makes us. The other millions of folded DNA have been turned off by crisper. Anybody with critical thinking skills can figure out why crisper has turned those off in us. The plastic model was not built around one bone. It was built with many bones from several individuals to give us an idea of what this hominid looks like. I think you need to go back and watch this video again, only pay attention this time.
@@LadyLeda2 I disagree.  There are multiple artifacts from all over the world tjsy have been filled in rother by plastic model or painting on pottery fragments etc.. dont get all upset because your &#39;scientific&#39; world view is questioned. Science as a religion is very unattractive. <br>Nothing has been turned off in our genes as a matter of permanent course. Its something you vant prove and it doesn&#39;t stand to reason. There is no difference in organisms that doesn&#39;t reside in the genes.  Differences don&#39;t appear out of thin air.  All the genome is involved in the making and functioning of each organisms parts. Apes might have 2 arms, 5 digits and 2 bipedal legs , but they doesnt mean we are literally 99% common genes because it leaves out 99% of the genes.

What makes us human is cooking. No other animal cooks. The calories available from food go way up after cooking. Nobody ever seems to mention this incredibly obvious fact. There&#39;s a book called &quot;catching fire: how cooking made us human&quot; which explains this concept in depth through a collection of stories that are very interesting to read. If our brain is what makes us human then how did we get this brain? That&#39;s the real question which is totally ignored by modern science. It&#39;s not about the brain, it&#39;s about the length of the intestines. Once you understand how human energy works you&#39;ll realize this is true.
Funny‚Ä¶I‚Äôm fairly sure humans can (and have) gotten by just fine without eating cooked foods.  They can be soaked, frozen and thawed, sprouted, fermented and consumed in all kinds of ways that break down, propagate, or unlock nutrients otherwise unavailable. Cooking is just one (albeit more convenient) limited method of doing so.

My ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is truth. If it‚Äôs not true, I don‚Äôt want any part of it. The geology that we have of a number of mega sequences of consecutive water deposited sediment layers over a mile deep with fossils in them around the world  on every continent necessitates a global flood catastrophe. I know that hurts the belief of every other made up alternate narrative. It just happens to be a fact that we are all the descendants of those who stepped off of the Ark in the area around Mesopotamia. <br><br>You can‚Äôt argue with known human history or ancient calendars going back only 5,000 years. The ancient civilizations are all descended from Noah who had sixteen grandsons that became the sixteen ancient the civilizations each with their own paternal haplogroup lineage. The Bible is the only text that outlines the following Table of Nations.<br><br>1)  Tubal Italy K,<br>2)  Javan Greek sea people T,<br>3)  Tiras Thracians L,<br>4)  Magog Asian O,<br>5)  Meshek Siberians N,<br>6)  Madai Medes Q,<br>7)  Gomer Europeans R,<br>8)  Arphaxad Arabs Hebrews I&amp;J,<br>9)  Elam Elamites H,<br>10)  Asshur Assyrians G,<br>11)   Aram Arameans F<br>12)  Lud Lydians F2, <br>13)  Cush Cushites A B &amp; C.<br>14)  Phut early Phoenicians E1,<br>15)  Canaan Canaanites E2, <br>16)  Mitzrayim Egyptians E3, <br>D is likely the Sinite tribe from Canaan. <br>C is the descendants of Nimrod since they can‚Äôt possibly be from anyone else. <br><br>Neanderthals are Japhethites and Denisovans are a mix of Japhethites and Hamites, not Semitic. It shows up on DNA maps and charts. Every grandson of Noah and their descendants have their own paternal Y chromosome haplogroup lineage! I can name all sixteen of them like I just did and give you each of their haplogroups!<br><br>The evolutionary out of Africa claim is exactly backwards since the <b>oldest</b> progenitor is Japheth the ancestor of Eurasians then the Semitic populations of Shem and then the Hamitic African is the youngest progenitor with their eldest sons connecting the three different families descended from the three sons of Noah. <br><br>It took me a while to understand that the evolutionary claim is assuming that SNP markers are being gained forming the stair steps out of Africa when <b>the reality is</b> that the original SNP markers cited are in fact being lost forming the opposite stair steps out of West Asia as known human history shows.  <br><br>The stair step out of Africa claim has to be addressed because the SNP markers are <b>real</b> evidence but the evolutionary assumption is exactly backwards.<br><br>The correct view requires that the older most original genomes of the Japhethites be connected to the Semitics by way of the eldest son of Shem which is Arphaxad (IJ). Arphaxad‚Äôs descendants can share the (IJK) SNP marker with the descendants of his uncle Japheth while the descendants of his younger brothers do not share that same (IJK) SNP.<br><br>You have to root the tree with Japheth the oldest son of Noah and then the oldest son of Shem (IJ Arphaxad) and then Elam and then Asshur and then the youngest brothers Aram and Lud. So you have to begin with the <b>most original</b> Y chromosome of Noah‚Äôs oldest son Japheth and then the changes occur in the people who were born later. It‚Äôs not necessarily a stair step of descendency.  It‚Äôs changes in the Y chromosome with time. <b>Arphaxad isn‚Äôt descended from Japheth.</b> He just shares a marker with his uncle that his father used to have when he was born. Shem then lost the marker when Arphaxad‚Äôs younger brothers were born.<br><br>The descendants of Shem are then connected to the descendants of Ham by way of Nimrod the King (C) the the eldest son of Cush who is the eldest son of Ham. So the Hamitic CF (xD&amp;E) paternal haplogroup SNP marker was lost to the <b>odd ones out</b> and less original younger brothers and cousins verifying the Table of Nations outlined in Genesis.üí• Learn the Bible before trying to learn anything else.<br><br>It‚Äôs also noteworthy that the D paternal haplogroup lines up with the E2 haplogroup of Canaan which is his son‚Äôs tribe of Sinim the Biblical namesake of China. So the only Hamitic haplogroups outside of Africa are the C of Nimrod and the D of the Canaanite tribe of Sinim which is still there in Andaman, Tibetan, Mongolian, Chinese and Japanese areas today.
Oh my goodness!!! I am sorry you believe all this. You know these stories in the old testament are copies of ancient stories found written on cuneiform tablets, from ancient Mesopotamia and Persia. The British Museum has thousands of these tablets and AI has translated them all. And Jesus never said he was the son of God. He implied it, but never said it. Even though he was asked many many times. This is why the Jews of today do not think he is the messiah. They are still waiting for the Messiah to come. There is no evidence of a worldwide flood.  Flooding has been happening on this Earth for thousands and thousands of years. What they are not telling you is the time period these floods occurred. Some are recent some are ancient. All major floods will leave a scar on the landscape for us to see. We can see the scars of many floods all over the Earth, but they happened at different times. There is evidence of a very large local flood around Jerusalem. Watch out for those wolfs that come disguised in sheep&#39;s clothing. Do some research for yourself. You also need to do some research on ancient man. All this haplogroup this and descendants of that sounds like hocus pocus to me. You can not know your haplogroup group unless you have a living relative to send in their DNA. I know, because I have done that. Someone is pulling your leg. I have no problem with believing in a higher power that may or may not have created this universe, or any of the billions of other universes out there. Yes there are billions of universes, each with a black hole in the center just like ours. Check out NASA&#39;s James Web telescope pictures. NASA has a channel here on U-tube. Our universe is beautiful. We can even see new stars being born right in front of our eyes!!!! <br>The out of Africa for humans is true. We have the skeletons to prove it. We can see the progression of man in these skeletons. But that does not have to mean that God did not create us. Maybe he created the Earth with evolution in mind. Maybe that is what he wanted to happen. I don&#39;t know, but neither do you. The Bible is a great teaching book. The New Testament has a lot of teachings of how to be kind to one another. The Old testament is full of revenge and how God will punish you if you do wrong. So is your God merciful, or vengeful? Or both? Sounds like two different Gods to me. <br>What ancient calendars going back 5,000 years?  Have you see pictures of them, or did someone just tell you that? Again, I say do your research. Don&#39;t be a sheep that follows what others tell you. <br>You can not have DNA maps without having real live DNA. Whose DNA are they using? Is there a descendant that they got the DNA from? We can not trace their descendants because we do not know who their descendants are. Someone is feeding you false information and I am sorry about that. I feel you should find another Church that teaches true doctrine and not these false teachings. <br>I could say a lot more about the things you wrote. But I am tired and must get some sleep. My wish for you is to find a new Church that teaches love and acceptance. Jesus even loved the sinners. He who is without sin cast the first stone. Remember that.<br>Laurie
@@LadyLeda2  The First Covenant Scriptures has a lot of love that you were never told about. That&#39;s beside the point. I referenced actual known human history, not hearsay and the DNA of people around the world. DNA doesn&#39;t lie. Eurasians have Neanderthal DNA and it shows up on a map where people have the most Neanderthal DNA. The Cohen modal haplotype verifies the lineage of Hebrews and Arabs.<br><br>Geology consists of six mega sequences of flood sediment layers on every continent including Antarctica with buried fossils throughout. To deny the global flood is to deny reality. It&#39;s the only history that we have.

About re-writing history: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f7jm3T_hao&amp;t=46">0:46</a>‚ûúJune 18, 1858, Charles Darwin received a paper from Alfred Russel Wallace that includes nearly indentical conclusions about evolution as Darwin&#39;s own, prompting Darwin to publish his theory.

This makes me think that much or all of this suite of behaviors emerged early in the hominin lineage. Probably <i>H. naledi</i> aren&#39;t <i>that</i> special -- and these behaviors haven&#39;t been documented in earlier hominins because this cave location is just extraordinary in terms of preservation.<br><br>But here&#39;s a crazy thought -- the extant, non-human Great Apes learn to do things from watching humans that they would never come up with on their own. They are smart enough to perform these behaviors, but don&#39;t have they right mental constitution to come up with them themselves. What if <i>H. naledi</i> were picking up behaviors from early <i>H. sapiens</i> in the region?

Not the usual format for this channel. <br><br>I personally find Berger very untrustworthy. Starting with his ego, his marketing strategies, his gold-rush ambition-driven motivation to start working in this field (something he even compares to lottery), his survival in an area he himself describes as cut-throat, his desperation for success, even sending his own child into that cave, then his actual despair at a failing career before this discovery..... it would be hard to make a movie out of his life where all that doesn&#39;t make the audience suspect a super-villain origin story is unfolding....<br><br>If nothing else his treatment of this site leaves a lot to desire in terms of scientific procedure and clearly more concerned with profits than professionalism.

One year further scientists discover that color of light is able to switch off some parts of the brain. If this is true than this proof that ‚Äúsomething outside‚Äù is in total control of our brain and a brain function as a trigger for emotional and physical activity. Scientists seems to forget that we are a part of the Universe, without the Universe we cannot exist. We all look the same but are wired differently and that creates our uniqueness and ID. It seems perfectly logical too me that humans and animals are not a stand alone product in this huge multi-Universe. We are very sensitive and dependent to our surroundings in the Universe. Dark winter days feeds depression. The Moon as a big influence on our moods and the hormones cycle of women, without oxygen we die, and so on so on. So why on earth we believe there is nothing beyond the molecules in our brain? The reason is simple because it‚Äôs already complicated enough, being open minded for interference of the ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù makes it more tough to chew on with sleepless nights. Although finally scientists become more open for ‚Äúscience fiction‚Äù in science that proofs the quantum theory.

My first memory scares the bee-G-zus out of me. I have night terrors- and I&#39;ve always had the same one- there&#39;s a man with a stocking on his head coming through my window and I&#39;m trying to wake up and scream or do something, but I can&#39;t move. I&#39;ve never seen the guy before, no idea who he is- just a made-up guy, I guess. I don&#39;t have them very often - I&#39;ve had it happen maybe 6-7 times throughout my whole life, that I remember- and I&#39;m in my fifties. But I&#39;m always terrified, I hate that feeling of fighting so hard to move or scream but not being able to- it&#39;s unbelievably frustrating. I think because when you finally can move- and you go to beat this guy silly- there&#39;s no one there, nothing&#39;s happening- that realization takes literally seconds to happen- and then you have no outlet for this very real anger and fear you just experienced. Anyway- what&#39;s that got to do with my first memory- right? Getting there- a few years ago someone asked me what my first memory was and I really couldn&#39;t distinguish that tbh- which kind of bugged me. I had like little clips of some images in my head, but I couldn&#39;t tell if it was part of one coherent memory or what. So i really started concentrating on it- trying to relive that memory and piece it together- and I did. My first memory is of that man climbing through my window when I was only 3-4 years old- I remember watching him push the curtains to the side and come through- it was very early in the morning- I had Scooby Doo curtains- same guy. Apparently, I&#39;ve been dreaming about this dude since the seventies. Wth? Why would a 3‚Äì4-year-old kid have a night terror? More importantly, why is it about some guy breaking in through the window? Shouldn&#39;t I be dreaming of bugs bunny and friends at that age? Instead, I got some guy climbing through my window scaring the bee-g-zus out of me. I&#39;m such a weirdo.
Maybe memories from childhood still present in adolescence were recalled frequently during life. They were recalled because they were important once and still to a certain extent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2703">45:03</a>
I have musical notes flowing through my blood, so to speak. I play several instruments and cannot survive without music. I also speak several languages. This is just to give some context. Proust ‚Äòs use of olfactory memory was absolutely astute‚Ä¶ I have not had the direct ‚Äúrecollection‚Äù in months but there was something that used to remind me of some Playtex bottles that my mom gave me when I was a baby. They had slits on the sides and the milk was placed in a baggie that would go inside. I remember holding my bottle and putting my fingers through the slits. It has not happened in a while but there was some smell that always brought that memory to mind. I know I exercise certain parts of my brain that keep certain memory skills active as I am a professional interpreter. But, I used to recall conversations word per word as described here but I am not sure I recall as many as I used to‚Ä¶ which scares me a bit. Emotional trauma and dwelling in those negative, sad feelings certainly play quite a number in our memories, I am an example of that. So, to emphasize creating positive memories and not dwelling in the sad ones that are not necessarily is a must and I keep working hard on it. We can all do it!  How wonderful our brains are!  I love this conversation, I revisit it every few months, it is soothing and motivating.
Fascinating subject. My father had an exceptional memory. He could remember meals he&#39;d had at particular plane flights, who had been the captain, etc. He was in the airline industry for a long time, so his interest was there, but he was really great at remembering lots of things. I often quizzed him over the years to check if he really remembered so much and I never caught him in a mistake. He was phenomenal in remembering people&#39;s names too and who the person was, their background, even though he met lots of people because of his work. I think he had a sort of &quot;Mind Palace&quot; memory mnemonic system. I didn&#39;t inherit this from him, unfortunately. I forget names very often, wish my memory was as good as his was.
Having explained how memory works in such debth through a visual example was interesting, but how do blind humans form memories insight the brain?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=1500">25:00</a> Not a memory structure as per se but a cogent comprehension of preparatory/anticipatory from having watched others, known and unknown, also attempt/ride bikes...we are introspectively aware of likely outcomes...just the same as watching someone walk on the stones as they cross a stream, Same idiomatic contextualization hence introspective.. Not &#39;mimicry&#39;. Learned safety/defense/conduct. Consciousness aggregates and conflates for cogency/sapience. Evolutional construct is logical and reconciliatory not causal. Etc...etc...
With over 100 Trillion synaptic endings in the human brain, the complexity of the possible pathways is practically infinite.  But this is a different matter than the simple question of where (for example) that song was resting that I learned as a child, and yet, even now, after decades, can recall with the tiniest prod.  Moreover, the brain is certainly not the only organ with neurons is it?  Heart and stomach both have clusters of these that are immense.  And remarkably, these also, historically have been used to speak of the identity or personal &quot;uberich&quot; of the individual.

I think the extent and reach of human memory is a very different process for people. Some have extraordinary reach and depth of memory and others very brief. It&#39;s also different for people on different subjects, making it a personal and unique way in which our neurochemistry is defined and functions. I can see Dr Greene has a specific interest in this subject and I wonder, why is that?
Well the Irish psychiatrist mentioned about hallucinations, some people do other people do experience esoteric phenomena which is much different. Extraterrestrial abductions, ghost apparitions, smoke suddenly appearing, moving lights suddenly, the soft halo of apparent souls moving, channelers written in sleep, all these phenomena happens. I saw a body of light and I was completely awaked and I saw that Sheddims ( souls without physical body mentioned in the Kabbalah), a body just of light where the rainbow of colors swirled. This phenomena is explained in the Kabbalah. A psychiatrist have to be an objective person and allows people that have witnessed these phenomena not to become traumatized by them but on the contrary value them, enrich or strengthen by them and continue moving on ahead.
Trauma emotions can be removed and should be done because it is possible ‚ù§it&#39;s solely self work. I used to be sad and stuck in my head for over 30 years and finally now freed and happy ‚ù§üòä‚ù§
It&#39;s interesting that till the point the experts were sharing the techniques of their individual expertise they seemed very precise and certain. But soon as the conversation came to the collective result of their work, they started rambling. The experts might have charted parts of the brain and the mind and have come to understand the two as units of form and function but they still have very little understanding of the combined processes of the two. And if you really want to see them perplexed, just look at them the moment the word  &quot;consciousness&quot; was thrown into the mix. That word is the Achilles heal of neurosciences.

Thank you very much for the remarkable discussion on memory, indeed it was a complex process (at the end of discussion, does it pointing on human&#39;s soul?). And actually, I have question, beside organic trauma which could affect the human memory, is that possible that the brain/memory it selves get injured by psychologic trauma? and how this could be explained through molecular basis?... Based on my own experience, huge lies impact on my memory and as consequences conflicted with the identity. And also, is that possible our memory already made before our birth? and if it is possible, how it could be?....any answer are welcomed....

A long line of kids walked in single file in a great big room to where a nun sat with a tennis racket. What was going on? Each crying kid was laid across her lap and whacked once, then hurried out a side door. It was 1943.

Years later figured out the whack aimed to keep kids afraid and quiet. <br>It was dark  and warm when Mom and Dad picked us up. He carried the baby. She had to be there, but I don&#39;t remember seeing my sister with us. We passed a streetlight that brightened the sidewalk briefly. I felt happy to be going home. We must have taken a bus. No car.

Trotted past dark dressers to  bright windows with closed curtained blinds, a couch and chairs. Brr cold in diapers, a shirt, and bare feet. Satisfied, I quickly turned back and closed the door behind me. First memory.

Not only memories mark a section of life we lived, but emotions also do to. Emotions and mind can also write the script for your life story, and it happens quickly too. Especially when angry or in time of sadness. Once the mind is made up, and those emotions distills in us, the solutions running through our minds tend to get to the point where action is taken.

In adition to the vast value of people&#39;s opportunity to receive an overview of what memories actually envolves, there&#39;s here also a great contribution from Veronica O&#39;Keane that could perhaps just as much in particular relate to people who are dealing with issues of the so called &quot;borderline psychotic&quot; kind then to those severily stuck with ever returning and lasting psychotic experiences involved with particular kinds of scizofrenia, in that where the psychosis obviously differs greatly from the latter, while on the surface tending to become exposed along with quite obvious discharges that are bound to disturb within the surroundings, it seems somewhat easily forgotten that the exposed and obviously suffering individual may what self concerns at the moment be particularly vulnerable to further trauma, and perhaps even to just as &quot;life eating&quot; trauma. There are experienses with possibly countertherapeutic forms of interaction followed by severe levels of medication over extensive periods of time that if not only being more then somewhat telling of misenterpretation may also involve the sorts of misconceptions that are related to a possibly far fetched understanding what relations mild forms of psychosis and trauma betweens concerns. <br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This is and was to many in parts a hard world in which indifference, for instance, may at times be a great advantage to some where an emotionally statured mind may become severily expensive, and so perhaps at times a bit speedy, if are there in accordance with O&#39;Keane&#39;s contributions hopes of reaching the missed calm that may establish entrances of interaction? (Alternatively to the otherwise severe amounts of lost time, of cause, while not forgetting either the works of explosive forms of behavior on us all is indeed realised.) <br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Proportions, and not unneccessary waste, which is what I somewhat happily presume in the end to keep partly as mantras and luckily to some extents as reminders while various suggestions and claims involving what later stands not only as misconceptions but in part also as such along with indifference above what &quot;there are others about&quot; may serve to have one ignore, while each and every contribution to a possible &quot;this day is a new day&quot; must be treated and remembered as the priceless parts of a life that may be one&#39;s own, gets one to get that at place in the end. It&#39;s not at all and not what so ever &quot;everything that doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger,&quot; but rather, &quot;didn&#39;t it kill you, then live with it, and you may still get to become surprised by what various forms and shapes of joy that you were about to miss.&quot;

If memories of sensory experience can modify our DNA as explained in this video, then can thought-as a product of memory--modify specific DNA? For example, could humans self-modify its own DNA through a collective desire, let&#39;s say, to have fewer toes? and thereby possibly passing its now modified DNA unto its offspring? This means intentional mind-driven evolution rather than waiting for a random, non-needs based, mutated gene to come about.

The fact that Mr. Beast&#39;s videos get more views than videos like this one, is NOT a shame, BECAUSE programs such as Mr. Beast help produce dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins and adrenaline, instantly, which people get without using too many areas of their brains. Those are of immense importance during times of effortless mental crisis management.<br><br>But videos like this one, make use of our brain space and demand for our active participation towards truly driving us to the solution of a problem, being part of which, not everyone has the patience for. <br><br>Usually when people lose something/ SOMEONE of great importance in their lives, they instantly run towards a dopamine/ adrenaline/ oxytocin boost. Then when they&#39;re somewhat satisfied, they get back into their normal routine. Whereas, very few people who still chase after the solution, tend to stick to videos like this one.<br><br>Neuroscience and related topics are NOT for people with standard IQ to understand or work on. Thus these videos will always have fewer THOUGH more intense audience, who NEVER STOP chasing after THAT solution.
None of them know or talk about how exactly recall memory comes up in our mind. Is it because of patterns of photons stored in hippo? Or vibrations?

When your organ including Brian, if you don‚Äôt use, it will Fade away, including walk,
But if you loose power, you will stuck.
If you know what I am in social media, you will surprise, I just answered your programs.
They don‚Äôt know, while you young under 10 years you will easily to learn new things and remember mostly you did. So it‚Äôs good age to learn languages or anything you like to learn, but as your ages growing before 25 years old, you will have knowledge to judge and choosing good thing or favorite things to do. But as your getting older, you will gradually remember things, or if you just watch TV didn‚Äôt use your brain thinking, your brain will loose brains cells unless you keeps learning new things, will develop or increase brain cells, but like dance if you older you still need dances over 3 times to remember that. But while your body might be tired, no enough sleep, don‚Äôt have energy. Talk about last night programs, I have 3 days go to that programs, didn‚Äôt sleep enough, eat meals, and those world conflicts two parties fighting, no way to solved that problem, and force me back up, in these situations I just sleep two hours last night. What do you expect, I am 70 years old, I have my Physical Therapy Aide Diploma with highest honors awarded. I have many year‚Äôs experience in the every areas.

Fascinating! I stumbled upon this video and I&#39;m so glad I took the time to watch it all.
Thank you for bringing this interesting topic to the table&#39;s surface.  All of you made this potentially complicated topic regarding memory/brain brilliantly comprehendable ... Thank you again.
I remember from i whas 3days old
Has anyone else noticed that the conscious observer within us has been unchanged since our earliest memories?
An interesting follow up might be the impact of technology such as asocial media and AI on the brain and behavior.
What does cognitive behavioral therapy do at the molecular level?
We clearly do not yet really understand at the molecular level how memory is stored and recalled in the brain
To all involved with this video from the narrator and writers and the artists and videographer and all the scientist , fantastic job well done making a the subject matter easy to comprehend and enjoyable. The voice of the narrator keeping me interested. Surely this won awards and deservedly so.
Great learning today. Thank you so much for the molecular level discussion.
So what i got from the 38+ minute segment, is basically to some degree confirming that memory is stored in the DNA. In form of binary 1s and 0s regarding if it&#39;s &quot;up or down&quot;. I might be over simplifying it but it&#39;s my take. I know Gregg Braden has written a book(The God Code) on this subject. Though I&#39;m not familiar off hand with his explanation.
I loved every minute of this. It&#39;s really fascinating to hear and try and understand the way our brains work.

It‚Äôs why your emotional reaction to an event can change over time (think of a bad break-up/being cheated on, and good/bad memories twisting).  I think that‚Äôs important in addition to meta-encoding at the post-synaptic level (amount of dopamine vs nonciceptin).

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2535">42:15</a> Quite awkward comments from a Head of a lab. <br><br>98% of the human genome don&#39;t produce RNAs with CONSISTENT functions. There is transcription (outstanding in its scale, but still not &quot;98%&quot;) looking more like a result of non-specific RNA polymerase activity. The important thing to understand is that the term &quot;regulatory RNA&quot; refers to an RNA with a particular set of functions consistently transcribed from the same gene. It&#39;s not just bits and pieces of RNA appearing at random from different places of the genome. A massive unspecific transcription &quot;with a function&quot; also undermines the notion of the transcriptome that defines different cell types. <br><br>Also, the term &quot;encode&quot; implies the use of the genetic code. That code is relevant only for messenger RNAs, NOT for regulatory RNAs that don&#39;t encode amino acids. So the genome cannot encode regulatory RNAs. Actually, they are also called &quot;non-coding&quot; RNAs. <br><br>By different estimations, we have about 200,000 different transcripts (RNAs), of which 20,000 code for proteins (PMID: 30124169). Protein-coding genes constitute 2% of the genome.

This is fascinating, the first time I have seen a plausible (albeit superficial) explanation for how thought and memory work. However, I do not share the idea that this is reductive, or somehow diminishes what we are.<br>We are made of the elemental forces of the universe, arranged into patterns that can expirence and contemplate its very existence. Then to further know that these patterns are the result of universal causation that traces back throughout time to the very moment of creation. If you think that a better understanding of how our bodily systems work, somehow diminishes what we are, then you do not fully grasp what you are.<br>Also consider that the universe appears to be (and is almost certainly), infinite. In that case every pattern will inevitably repeat, and not just once, but throughout infinity.<br>This implies that the perception we are separate finite beings, is in fact an illusion. We are far more than the some of our parts, and in more ways than we can possibly imagine. If these facts don&#39;t convince you, and fill you with awe and wonder, you&#39;re not paying attention.

I can remember Monday on Tuesday well, come Thursday I&#39;m not gonna know. I can prime a memory with a note/picture for months and when I stop it will be swept away. I couldn&#39;t recognize my daughter, friends, boyfriend shaved his face, he looked familiar but no memory came forward. If I close my eyes and listen/ed to their voice I&#39;m in a better position. This started in 2015 I&#39;m 37y/o
i hate people who have needs to access others memories. they are evil and abusive know the facts on that.

It&#39;s really misleading to claim that energy is transferred in neural signaling, it&#39;s really quite minimal, there&#39;s no current, only an &#39;action potential&#39;, a wave of ion flows in and out of the cell essentially transverse to the direction of the signal.

Assalamualaikum sir üíìüíìüíìüíìüíì
Awesome program! Thanks to the experts for their professional explanations, which solved my hard thinking. Hopefully what I have learned from you will help you too.<br><br>What is consciousness?<br>The subconscious information of the network of neurons is decoded or encoded by the thalamus, and the resulting electrochemical substance is consciousness.<br><br>Consciousness, subconsciousness, and deep consciousness are subjective distinctions created by the interaction of various organizational structures in the human brain.<br><br>Our consciousness is like an electrochemical flow, divided into conscious stream, subconscious stream and deep conscious stream. Transfer information electrochemically between neuronal networks.<br><br>But we cannot perceive the deep stream of consciousness, luckily we all know what we are thinking. That is, we all know our consciousness, so when the subconscious information of the network of neurons is decoded or encoded by the thalamus, the resulting electrochemical substance is consciousness.
Thank you so much
Absolutely love the channel and this particular show. With this one and a few more I have noticed that towards the end, discussion reaches a point where there is no answer. I think that is where they need to have a couple of practitioners from spirituality such as vedantic scholars or monks that have done years of meditation. I love the modern science and gadgets and tests that discover new facts. The spiritualists can take it to the next level and show that it&#39;s not just that perception is reality but in fact reality is a perception.
That was incredible. I particularly liked the bit piece towards the end, where Veronica made reference to that feeling we all have on occasion - when we sense something other than ourselves (in her words, consciousness looking back at us) - because it is reminiscent of a recent talk given by two well-known Dzogchen masters during which one of them described a meditation practice where the meditator would - in effect - throw their consciousness into a corner and have it look back at them. Great discussion guys. Thank you üôè
Interesting.Thank you
My first memory is around 2-3 years age... I lost myself in the back of my house.
I got bored at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=2760">46:00</a> how far did you get?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=5023">1:23:43</a> dude, what she says here made so much sense. Us being aware of ourselves to this extent and looking at ourselves is the illusion of there being something more. More conscious things must be capable of becoming aware of this illusion too?
Could have been a great presentation but died from the boredom of the quests.

Thanks Brian and WSF for these wonderful and educative videos. I have been a great fan of your writing for well over a decade. I have also been a subscriber to this channel for many years now, Have watched your documentaries and loved them. These videos with the brilliant guests you have are absolutely a breath of fresh air for someone like me with a curious mind. It‚Äôs staggering that we live in a time when such content is widely available at minimal monetary cost if that. Thanks for this brilliant content and wish you all the best.
I feel like the panelists missed the mark in answering some of Greene&#39;s questions, but it was definitely a great episode.
I am a happy and very contented ignorant with a very peaceful and fullfiling life. I just heard cakling in a chicken yard. <br>So stupid I am I did not learn how to cakle with the video.
Great discussion until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=88">1:28</a> mark and one of the guests (Tim Bredy) says that if we lean on technology more it frees up creativity. Although this guest was extremely knowledgable, I don&#39;t think he understands the roots of something like creativity. Creativity is not based on a clear path of thinking, but it&#39;s based rather on just the opposite - the energy and identity forces at work when our path of thinking is blocked, repressed, etc.
A great discussion although from my POV I would have liked more talk on the use of implantable, synthetic devices for memory storage and BCIs for &quot;off site&quot; memory storage / computation.  My organisations The Neural Archives Foundation, has particular interests in a number of the points that were discussed but primarily how this stored information might be recovered from frozen neural tissue.<br><br>Also, as usual, Brian did a great job leading the discussion!  Well done everyone!

Admittedly dated, but I am reading Carl Sagan‚Äôs The Dragons of Eden.  He talks about the structure of our brains and speculates on the origins of the right and left hemispheres.  He speculates that originally they were redundant.  Doing the same thing. But as humans evolved one of the hemispheres evolved to do rational thinking.  He reminds us that the Greeks used geometry, shapes to perform mathematics, using the right hemisphere of the brain long before humans used numbers using the left hemisphere.  Mathematics today is taught using shapes as well as numbers integrating the right and left hemisphere‚Äôs of the brain.  Maps and multiplication are still quite relevant in the opinion of this writer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=84">1:24</a> The Theory of Semantic Molecules. :D
Sounds like Rebecca the memory girl might try a mild GABA agonist to censor her memory somewhat.
Is memory just factual imagination? This does have the advantage of defining it as a subset of imagination, not considered similar to memory.
&quot;Recalling the memory to now is like imagining it in a different spacetime location.&quot;
I know what I experienced there‚Äôs no mystery
I don&#39;t remember who I am or where I am or what this is or what that is!  üò∂
What makes us human? God did! <br><br>The theory of evolution does not have the logistics. Epigenetic-derived adaptations take as little as two generations to set new adaptations, such as factually in finches. Your evolution mentors postulate it takes over 2 million years as with the Darwin Finches. If epigenetics does it in just 17 years, then why would genetic-based evolution have to kick in 2 million? <br><br>There are FIVE information codes in every cell, aside from blood cells. The five are the DNA code, the mtDNA code, the epigenome code, the &#39;sugar&#39; code that lines the surface of every cell, and the lipid code making up cell membranes. All these had to work in unison. The makeup of these for life are mathematical impossibilities-by-chance. To say the ribosome sums up evolution is ludicrous.    That is defined as a 10^50 or more. It&#39;s far too complex without outside intelligence to make it happen. On top of this, the Intelligent Designer is a master chemist with 65 different hormones in the human body. We are a creation.. Not an evolution.<br><br>Quite simply everyone, there is a biological system already in place...therefore  God-engineered, logistically...doing all of the classic adaptations. What is this biological system? It&#39;s called the epigenome. It&#39;s actions is called epigenetics. This includes adaptations seen in Darwin Finches without any natural selection of DNA mutations. Instead it&#39;s modifications by chemical tagging turning genes up and down or on and off for different structures such as new beaks for new diets. This is FAST...doing its job in just 2 generations, not millions of years by &#39;evolution&#39;. Evolution is a scam folks. We are an intelligent design by Jesus Christ. This means he offers a free gift of eternal life just for believing in it and believing he resurrected. Take the free gift today!!!
Wow, that was alot of uninteresting, false, reigious bs, lame enough to be included in that book of rubbish you people love so much

My first memory is under a tree at a free festival... not sure if it was stonehendge or Glastonbury (I don&#39;t remember üòÖ) but I have a vivid memory of being under a tree, in a buggie, in the shade and our family dog was watching over me...that&#39;s it! But it remains vivid and I have later discovered that when I was &lt;1 years old we had a heatwave in the UK (1976) which wss a rare occasion back then.. this makes me feel that it is a real memory and not just one of the many festivals I attended as the kid of hippies üòä its was reinforced when I asked my mum (at maybe 20+) she was baffled that I remembered how sunny and hot that time was... but who knows, it feels real - even though I still struggle to recall last week ü§≠
It‚Äôs very interesting that approaching my 40 I started to dream my past experiences - it‚Äôs like coming back memory of my birth- literally the peak of struggle reaching the light, other past lives in strong action moments- short but so vivid and clear dreams/memories üòÖ..

I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. They&#39;re are various pharmaceutical and talk therapies that could help. One of which is EMDR therapy (or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) which doesn&#39;t try to forget your memory but more or less turn down the emotions and feelings that accompany those memories. I hope you can get the help you need!
Very nice sir hi ji
Very important topic, love to learn and study human brains!!
&quot;God is all around you, you&#39;re just looking for Him with your head instead of with your heart. You cannot see that God is everywhere because you&#39;re looking for Him with your eyes instead of with your soul. You cannot feel God&#39;s presence inside you because you&#39;re looking for Him out in the world. You cannot know God&#39;s truth because you cannot know the mind of God&quot; <i>et al, ad infinitum!</i><br><br>It seems to me that as to believe in God is purely an act of faith - that is to say, one can <i>only</i> come to believe in God via subjective, rather than objective, measures - that when this fact is considered in tandem with the capacity for imaginative sophistry that is unique to the human mind,  there is simply no argument that could ever be constructed disproving God&#39;s existence in our world. With every argument I&#39;ve ever heard in favour of atheism, it is almost trivial to imagine a counter-argument that could be used against it, in favour of theism. No matter that the plurality of these counter-arguments then become self-contradictory, and thus incoherent, for once again this understanding of logic (by humans) can always then be argued against on &quot;unknowability&quot; grounds. &quot;God is mysterious, who are we to say He should be apprehendable to our minds&quot; etc. etc., <i>ad infinitum.</i> It will always be a case of defence by circular reasoning. <i>Reductio ad absurdum.</i> <br><br>And so the atheists cause looks utterly hopeless. The war had been lost even before the first rhetorical shot had been fired. Quite simply, God&#39;s existence in our world cannot ever be refuted... <br><br>...not in <i>our</i> (human) world, anyway. But there are a good deal many creatures than simply humans in the wider world. Indeed, when considering <i>all</i> creatures, both great and small, to have ever existed the number of &#39;non-human beings&#39; simply swamp the &#39;being&#39; kind. And applying human sophistry in explaining the issue of the existence, and suffering, of animals, suddenly begins to look like a <b><i>much, much</i></b> more difficult project to sustain. <br><br>Because... Why? <br><br>Why, what possible reason could an omnipotent, omniscient, omni-benevolent creator have in creating so much seemingly unnecessary suffering? Why?<br><br>It may well be that theists will simply wave their hands around a little, as though clutching at the air, then simply shrug their shoulders and look to the sky&#39;s again. But, when considering the totality of suffering experienced by the animals of this Earth, literally, the &#39;lambs of God&#39;, well, the usual human sophistry defences (&quot;who are we to know the creator&#39;s mind?&quot;) suddenly don&#39;t seem so unassailable. In fact, they don&#39;t look defensible <i>at all.</i> <br><br>...thoughts.
I would like to know, how so many words could be used in your statement, without really saying anything at all, and remember, short is sweet
Excuse me but the double helix was discovered by Rosalind Franklin, whose results were stolen by Watson and Crick. Better not to perpetuate history mistakes
Science definitely gives new way of thinking üòä
I am happy to have seen this... we have come a long way in chunking down the mechanics; if scientific method holds, next we can conduct experiments to see an actual emotional orchestration of the brain in color.
In my view, science is focusing on the wrong place to locate the source(s) of memory: <br><br>our individual BODIES instead of the common to all EARTH.<br><br>To render knowledge suitable for practical application to satisfy needs of beings it is essential that we first describe how an ideal system of life on this earth SHOULD function before analyzing any phenomenon. <br><br>And then analyze the reason(s) why the current state of that phenomenon deviates from that ideal in order to rectify it.<br><br>In that sense, it is ideal that the sources of memory be inside the earth and our need perceptions (hunger, fear, pain) occur only when any deviation from that ideal state happens inside the earth, and those sources require our intervention to restore that ideal state.<br><br>The above mentioned ideal state is:<br><br>when a being feels hungry it automatically knows where ~ on which plant ~  to find the food, or when it feels fear or probable pain it also knows what action to take on which plant to prevent it before the given threat factualizes.<br><br>So all search for knowledge MUST be restricted to discovering the functions of plants as results of particle interactions inside the earth to compose and sustain them. <br><br>A TASK FOR PARTICLES PHYSICS.<br><br>Hence BIOLOGY, and of course all other so called SOCIAL SCIENCES, must automatically follow from the mathematical model of the particle physical mechanism how plants grow due to particle interactios inside the core of the earth that compose seeds, water and fertilizers (= the air).<br><br>That means all beings are to be seen as RCD (Remote Control Devices) that process the air (fertilizer) the earth delivers in order to rectify the errors in its internal function experienced by the individual being as NEED requiring action on unique plants for each being to satisfy it.<br><br>Thus, life function itself can be formulated mathematically as:<br><br>N   =    f(S)<br><br>where N is the feeling of need in the being formulated as unique combination of particles,<br><br>and S the correponding means for its satisfaction formulated similarly as relevant combination of other particles to be grown on plants.<br><br>Instead of trying to understand nature&#39;s purpose of phenomena, we MUST concentrate on our own purpose of SUSTENANCE OF PLEASANT LIFE FUNCTION in it, and look for ways to factualize that purpose assuming nature permits it, for if it is not the case, then there is absolutely no point in wasting time, efforts and funds to collect knowledge.
Alot of words, yet nothing said

In my opinion, one of the best WSF episodes ever! Terrific panel of guests.
This was a good one, however they should of had sapolsky on
Excellent discussion and Brian Greene always asks excellent questions. It would be interesting to ask the panel what their thoughts are about AI Superintelligence.
Hell yeahhh! It is alive!
As always, this is just another piece of gerat knowledge festival... However, I have to say that there is always a pretty feelable sense of stage fright among almost all of the speakers and the host. <br>I am always on alert for BRIAN GREENE`s work-of-art type topics and discussions on world science festival because I learn and get fantastic insights from the top notch professors and academics about the things that I am both personally and professionally interested in. <br>Perhaps, I should not say that but I feel somehow compelled to express what I was kind of given by watching this discussion that is, I think, if these discussions on World Science Festival, are not made  in front of live audience, instead, if BRIAN GREENE hosts these great festivals like in the times, when he was hosting it alone sitting alone infront of windows  through each of which there was a scientist speaking with BRIAN GREENE,,, it would be marvelous because only then both the host and the speakers are feeling at the best level of comfort,,,, I know.... everone who is familiar with human behaviour, consciousness and language, is certainly realized that the stage fright is present in such discussions and it also hampers the level of productivity, level of questions, better insights and so on.......... I think I have made it clearer, at least, to those who think the same and wish the same. Hopefully, this great show would be hosted in a more intimate atmosphere, not in front of a live audiance and also the audiance hampers the producivaty of such discussions too is not that so ?...... because clearly, not everbody is keen on many details  and what is really going on in the discussion..... <br>Best regards to all the speakers and of course to BRIAN GREENE he is a real giant in the realm of science, we are really too luck to have him among us in this era.
My earliest memory, ~ 2.5 yrs?, was of me in a crib (1st person; can picture the bottom of the crib set off the floor, bars, etc), and my mother leaving the room.  Then shortly thereafter looking through the bars I see a spider - vague image, but lots of little legs and a body heading towards me  on the floor.  I scream ‚ÄúMommy mommy‚Äù, freaking out, until she comes back, by which time the spider had crawled under the crib and disappeared!  I am even more freaked out because I don‚Äôt know where it is, but with minimal language skills, cannot explain why I am screaming.  My mother tries to convince me everything is all right, and leaves.  Don‚Äôt remember much after that.  Two points.  (1) that was the first time (as far as I know) I saw a spider - and still I went ballistic.  (2) I remember a minute or so before seeing the spider as part of the memory.  This is VERY important, as it means that what was in working memory was also recorded with the memory.  Without the earlier memory, you may not be able to predict a dangerous situation if it repeats.  That is not relevent in this situation, but could be in may others.  As for (1), a Columbian friend says he is ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù to react to a ball with 8 lines radiating out (symbolic of a spider) and even drawing a circle and 8 lines on a chalk board generates an adrenalin spike in him.
When you &quot;figure it out&quot; all on your own, the emotional euphoria released ensures you will remember.<br><br>Don&#39;t copy off your neighbor.
I have so many questions.  How are these researchers turning on and off a person&#39;s ability to retrieve their own memories?  Can a person&#39;s individual awareness or consciousness be &quot;&quot;erased&quot;, so that they are not themselves?  How long can a person&#39;s emotions be &quot;turned off&quot; before any lasting damage occurs?
Wait... So thinking happy thoughts alters Dna...
Concepts as I understand them are a representations of what humans not fully understand but at the same time they acknowledge its existence even if only mentally,‚Ä¶etc <br>usually it‚Äôs something agreed on its existence, but may not be agreed on its essence (ambiguity)‚Ä¶<br>to concise it‚Äôs a concept till they agreed on its essence!
they want to specify location and momentum at the same time at subatomic level too! they can not deal with time as a process the same way at subatomic level !second derivative to time !  it is possible to reach high certainty even at subatomic level too, but that will never happen before deep understanding of the fundamentals of physics such as space, time, constants, ‚Ä¶. and connecting units firstly (much harder scientific work),  they even can not recognize yet that time is a process ! Dirac‚Äôs wonder (LNH) is real (future generations have to connect both levels (subatomic and cosmological levels), to be able to understand what is going on.<br>(Everything is governed by science and only science and statistics is an approach that could work in deterministic field before they eventually can figure out that it‚Äôs deterministic too.
The idea that memories are somehow stored in the brain is one of the greatest lies of all time. It&#39;s in fact IMPOSSIBLE for the neuronal brain to act as the storehouse of memories. A depolarisation is immediately followed by a repolarisation in milliseconds thus rendering even working memory IMPOSSIBLE.
Well their not stored in your big toe, or the elbow, so then where ??
@@psycho6542 They&#39;re not stored in the brain at all. They can&#39;t be. It&#39;s a lie.
üòä wow thank you all !!
This was great, particularly the bit about RNA function in synaptic plasticity - perhaps this is why some instinct (learned lessons from one lifetime) can be passed to offspring. Do you think even our understanding of 3D space/shape was learned via evolution and passed on in DNA? I think some memories are triggered by what 3D shape we are currently attending to, and what shapes from memory may be similar (that there is a mechanism for triggerability via proximity/likeness in perceptual space). For example, once when attending to my torso while lying in bed, I had a memory flash of my torso while driving a Volvo, but the road going towards ceiling for torso in memory to align with torso of current attention.
Attending your torso?
@@malindabrowning9240yes, like my chest- for most people the constant locational shifts of their attention escape their conscious observation, but if you learn to pay attention, the brain must &#39;render&#39; even inertial forces and internal movements of balance and adjustment.
These descriptions and explanations are splendid, yet they keep changing as more measuring devices are made. Associations to human feelings are dynamic, non-linear and context-depending.<br>It does keep learners occupied in comprehending the terminologies and flow of logic in making some sense of the data collected by devices and by observations.<br>Difficulty of such pursuits does not make it superior. Functionality in mitigating real problems make it more relevant. Issues are on-going and has no solution. Only problem statements have solutions. So the pertinent question is, &quot;What problem, if any, is it going to solve?&quot;.
I can remember what happened but I  can&#39;t see myself even I was there, do you know what I mean!!
this is a very difficult subject and I could tell that our guests were always clear with their answers.
With Brian Greene at helm, you can be sure that the talk would be high quality and interesting. However I would have wanted to hear a bit more on the exact mechanics of memory formation and retrieval, involving neurons and circuits. The talk was more general.
This was such a beautiful conversation
Since this subject has far reaching implications... I&#39;d like to take a minute and point out something very important that needs to be addressed as well. A personalized individual digital database creation combined with neural augmentation that entrains the brain and uses it like a sensory organ versus allowing natural neurological synapses and processes is NOT consciousness nor memory. The essence that makes a person is NOT present in that digital imitation fake a brain IARPA. Do you realize the Military calls people under computer control Flesh Puppets? Human Nodes on a Network like equipment? What makes us human is NOT transferrable in those digitized creations.

He told me he that now he was doubting if he was even an historical person with a propper mail address: &quot;All these stories lie in a bit of a messy fog...&quot;. Jesus today seemed in quite a desperate mood. 500.000 germans have resigned the church this year alone. Something to do with many thousandfold abuses of authority. But I ask myself: Why do you bring up death and debt in context of a a fantastic science-show that enlights us on the majestic gravity of the neurobiology of human memory?
Imagine a bunch of highly corrupt psychologists (contract psychopaths) over a prolonged period constantly trying to grove terrible memories in you as a targeted process of making your worldview models pathetic and nonsensical.
Surely a memorable episodic memory is formed of this episode on memory.

I remember being put in the crib during the daytime and experiencing how the sunlight was glowing an orange red color through my thin baby eyelids,, and thinking about how I was breathing.<br>Later in my life I remembered that as I was starting to be able to breath through my mouth on demand, and how I could switch from using my nose and then my mouth, because there was this sensation in my nasal cavity that I was feeling and controlling.<br><br>Many years later, I found out this only happens in about the first 9 months of life.<br>I definitely remember being a baby.<br><br>I also remember what I now can call the great forgetting period, and I sort of argued with my mother, around the age of 4, that I had a harder time remembering things from before and she told me I couldn&#39;t remember those things, and yet I described some things that I obviously still remembered, and she said,  oh your just reinforcing those memories from pictures or stories, but Noooooo, I remember from inside my head and my own eyes, what I was experiencing, and pictures could only help, but not be the cause of these memories of breathing and controlling my nasal vs mouth breathing.
Are you hyperphantasiac by any chance? You can imagine things with as much clarity as your real visual sight? Just curious.
What if the brain only keeps the thumbnails while the actual memory is not local? The experience is used to power Evolution, like a collective vault we call Nature. This is because build instructions is not in DNA.
Our identity is just memory

For many years human was writing for the sake of future generations and science while the sick irrational thief apes were busy with stealing and polluting human thoughts then erasing human traces (systematically), they wanted to maintain their faked imaginary irrational realm!
This not actual reality (far more complicated than that), but just to make it easier to comprehend: you can imagine cycle two (this existence), is the software that generates this universe (cycle one which built within cycle two).<br>This was written many years ago (respond) <br>It was about how human at the end will find out that they are already on the top of one of the most advanced technology in existence itself,‚Ä¶.etc
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=5160">1:26:00</a> even regarding current computers, hardware is the medium that softwares work through!<br>what if it was reversed ?! software is what creates hardware and uses it (the details were written many years ago, one of the irrational thieves has stolen and polluted human thoughts, could be many other irrational thieves did)!<br>this is just an analogy (approach), the reality is far more complicated than that.
Our software creates hardware  , applies only to living creatures .<br>The interesting thing about it is that our brain can be likened to a country. The more developed the country is, the more roads and highways can be seen, the same goes for the brain
Current accumulated scientific knowledge isn‚Äôt enough even to‚Ä¶.. !<br><br>Humans have not even climbed the first step on the ladder of science, and humans will not open the gate to science before a deep understanding of the fundamentala of physics such as space, constants, ‚Ä¶ and gravity.
To reach cycle two that requires deciphering gravity (deep understanding), but gravity has nothing to do with consciousness type one at all (some irrational thieves had wrong interpretations of what they have stolen).<br>space is one indivisible unit (current understanding of space, gravity, constants,‚Ä¶etc) is wrong.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4980">1:23:00</a> to say something beyond physics is not the proper understanding (nothing would come into existence without science whatsoever), it‚Äôs beyond current physics (related to cycle two but governed by science and science).<br>consciousness type one is one of the most important secrets in existence itself.<br>current accumulated scientific knowledge isn‚Äôt enough at all.<br>to concise: what generates both personal identity and consciousness type one is self concept (no one can break human thoughts ‚Äúimpossible ‚Äú)<br>but mankind is up to it, it could take up to two thousands of years of continuous scientific work by real rational intelligent human scientists.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzxI8Xjx1iw&amp;t=4920">1:22:00</a> matter (human brain) can yield consciousness type one because it‚Äôs a process that requires human brain (in this case), consciousness type one is the key for mankind to decipher both consciousness type one and type two.<br>even though at the end self concept (one of the most advanced coding systems in existence itself), but it‚Äôs possible to decipher consciousness type one.
Humans painted their memories on the walls of the caves and texts too since thousands of years ago (no real difference).
Memory is important to keep personal identity coherent (it‚Äôs a process).
Here you find the explanation of why Time is a process not a dimension, you have to read till the end to be able to understand: There‚Äôs a difference between Time is the measurement and Time is a process l, because time is the process of measurement (that is why they couldn‚Äôt understand what time is till this moment ), clock hands (minutes and hours) are the reference (memory) the calculation of seconds (The tick of the clock, and oscillation in atomic clocks )  is present time (future in clocks has different approach, clock itself doesn‚Äôt recognise future)<br>to concise the whole process is time (it‚Äôs a PROCESS)<br>in human brain the whole process in clocks takes place but humans have memory and can anticipate future (next step based on previous experiences or calculations but in clocks they have fixed pace unless something happens to seconds hand ) so in human brain there‚Äôs a whole process (ticking or oscillation, processing ‚Äúincluding cognition ‚Äú and memory.<br>in human brain the processing itself is the present time and the result of processing is the past time ‚Äúin memory‚Äù.<br>in pysics it requires space to calculate time, but in human brain probably works at level close to Planck‚Äôs length,. in human brain there are more than one clock, one is very accurate such as how humans reach perfecrion in shooting, and other games, and inacurate clock that works in conscious experience (daily life) and that is more effective (no need for high accuracy). clocks can‚Äôt recognise time but human brain can. there‚Äôs action but could be quantum action or possible mental action in the brain too (but very likely Quantum action) (so-called Quantum action could be the minimum action). talking about space here is in the classical physics (normal equations where we calculate speed and distance) but that is the core of clocks in general (time = distance / speed) the shift in seconds hand.  but there‚Äôs minimum action (Planck‚Äôs scale). mental clock requires action too but different approach. to concise human brain can recognise time unlike clocks (it‚Äôs a process). Planck is one of the best former scientists.<br><br>Hopefully the idea is clear, I hardly can focus.<br><br>I think the idea is that time is a bit complicated: why do you need the minute hand and the hour hand? Because time is a process and not just the ticking of the seconds hand, here I am talking about the conventional scale of ordinary clocks , and I am not talking about the scale of atomic clocks, but it is the same idea at the end. but there‚Äôs a big difference: clocks can‚Äôt recognise the ticks of seconds hand but humans can.<br><br>There‚Äôs a mental clock for sure: it‚Äôs the result of continuous approximate calculations of dimensions and speed, it‚Äôs inaccurate but very effective in usual daily activities such as: is that narrow road is enough to my car to pass through?!, but there‚Äôs other type of time which is very accurate and very likely based on physical clock similar to atomic clocks.<br><br>to reach perfection in some shooting sports (repeatable) indicate that there is a very accurate clock (probably more accurate than modern clocks), in human brain (very likely) it is in cerebellum, accompaned with  other accurate caluculqtions such as wind speed,‚Ä¶.etc. of course all that happen unknowingly.<br><br>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ <br>By the way, they hide or delete human valuable precious thoughts for theft purposes (many of the irrational thieves wrote books only out of human thoughts), they worked in a systematic collective theft and worked on erasing human traces).

1: 14:90 memory is just a small part of the whole process, but here you can connect what they have mentioned before about DNA to how humans acquired psychological traits through genes from their parents (far more complicated than that).<br>the process of generating personal identity is one of the most complicated process in human brain related to body, memory, environment, cultures,‚Ä¶.etc <br>but the phenomenon of transferring psychological traits via heart transplant is related to the same topic,‚Ä¶.etc.
I&#39;m not sure if this is what you are trying to say or imply, but if you&#39;re thinking that emotional or memory experiences of parents can effect the DNA of their future children, then that&#39;s simply not the case.  On the mother&#39;s side of things, the DNA in her ovum (eggs) is present at her birth and certainly isn&#39;t being changed.  On the fathers side, the DNA in the sperm he produces is also not being changed by any experience he has stored in his brain.  I also think you may have misunderstood what they meant when referencing to &quot;changes&quot; in DNA.  They are likely talking about gene expression, not actual physical changes in DNA sequences.  If this is not what you were implying, then please ignore my reply.
@@johnchappell4492 I don‚Äôt mean exactly what they said (that can‚Äôt maintain the state), but I talk about genes in general.<br>but they are unaware of what‚Äôs behind what they have noticed (their interpretations are incorrect).<br>there‚Äôs something else far more complicated than that (governed by science and only science).<br>it‚Äôs possible to make that as axioms (if you understand who you are then you will be able to recognise which psychological traits you acquired from your mother or your father and which are related to your own experience), it‚Äôs possible to turn that to axioms (just understand your personal identity).<br>to concise: it‚Äôs something else far more complicated but related to genes too, I think that will take at least few thousands of years of continuous scientific progress for mankind to figure out what is going on.
What they said can‚Äôt maintain the states in human brain especially rapidly changing states (there‚Äôs something else far more complicated behind that), what they mentioned can‚Äôt maintain a complete mental and psychological states for instance in the case of transferring psychological traits via heart transplantation.<br>(too early to figure out the mechanism behind maintaining the state in human brain).
I didn‚Äôt want to mention that directly but there is something else uses genes (very advanced coding systems), something else governed by science but very far from humans to grasp (could take up to thousands of years to recognise it).<br>they will figure that out as soon as they recognise that they can‚Äôt build living entity from scratch.<br>that has nothing to with so-called gods, ‚Ä¶..etc<br>but it‚Äôs science, humans can recognise that as soon as they decipher gravity (gravity has nothing to do with that directly, but it will open the gate to reach cycle two).<br>it‚Äôs not good to mention that but (everything is governed by science and only science ‚Äûnothing would come into existence without science whatsoever ‚Äû). to concise: what they said can‚Äôt maintain rapidly and continuously changing states in human brain but there‚Äôs something else uses genes and can maintain the states.
It‚Äôs not easy to comprehend but this could help: they think that starting from one cell then go to the miracle (they give that ambiguous names such as complexity,‚Ä¶..etc), at the same time they claim that they don‚Äôt believe in so-called gods and miracles but at the same time they want things to take place miraculously!<br>everything is governed by science and only science but this existence is far more complicated than that!<br>there are no miracles: nothing will happen miraculously such as  turning complexity into miracles! there‚Äôs something else far more advanced and governed by science (nothing would come into existence without science whatsoever), there‚Äôs evolution but the interpretations are wrong, it‚Äôs possible to start from simple to become more complicated and advanced at the same time in cycle two but cycle one (this universe) never started simple at all (evolution does exist but their interpretations to evolution and life is completely wrong).
It went to far to reach so-called ontology but maintaining the state is important part of what they interpret as life (life is related to cycle two not to cycle one)<br>this universe (cycle one) is built within cycle two (this existence), very likely space is one indivisible unit (current understanding of space is wrong) and how some constants solved the problem of infinity, ‚Ä¶.. etc indicate that this universe never came into existence by a mere chance (complexity that leads to miracles doesn‚Äôt exist !) <br>this universe built within cycle two for sure, I think that humans need 400 to 2 thousands of years to recognise that (solid scientific evidences).

I was very impressed with your guests.  Certainly surprised of my own level of understanding the concepts expressed in your discussion. Thank you, most informative.  As always Dr. Brian Greene does not disappoint.
Brainiacs want to deal with things like memory with some kind of advanced technology because they don&#39;t know how to do it naturally, but the fact is that memories are dependent on one&#39;s perception of the past. Change your perception of the past, and the memory changes. Memories are also depending on how you evolve in the future. Change into a different person and your perception of reality will change and therefore your perception of memories will change. There&#39;s no one on the earth who understands this better than me. If you want to have a proper discussion about memory, and what kind of education people need to get in order to heal their negative memories and transform themselves into healthy and positive people, the one that you need to interview is me. As you wish, Brian Green. üôèüèª

Awesome range of views. Somewhere along I imagined the &quot; synergy&quot; that takes form when Hydrogen and Oxygen give rise to water. I wonder if consciousness expresses it self in the synergy. That it happens invariably and repetitively suggests that the synergy isn&#39;t the cause but the expression by some law of this consciousness. All creatures therefore have this power. It is seemingly more pronounced and nuanced in man.... Thanks for this episode WSF.

To remember something is to create the memory. The moon is not there when you are not looking.
My first memory is from when I was in the back yard with my brothers and a German Shepherd (no surprises there...lol). The weird part is that when we left that house for a different house i was eighteen months old. <br>So I can remember something from when I was a toddler.
My son remembers being about three months old and we can vouch for this as he remembers the fridge being in the breakfast room, not in the kitchen. He can point it to its exact place and he&#39;s right. <br>I remember being in cot and crawling. I also remember sitting in my dad&#39;s slipper and pretending it was a boat. Then I looked up and my dad was so tall! <br>I have many memories of that kind, all from a very early age.
Unfortunately with all the respect to the experts I found the contribution a little poor. How ever B Green shone like always.

I find it a bit perplexing that people can assume, limit, their belief to thinking what we see and know is enough to explain something like consciousness or life. What we do know, if we look from a sufficient perspective of the whole, is that life repeats on all scales in all directions, and its safe to assume that we do not know all scales. This makes it hard to think that mind, consciousness, awareness is original, and limited to and a result of the brain as we understand it, that it isn&#39;t a version of something else, like a microcosm of something fundamental. Mind as far as we know is intrinsic to everything, because we cannot know anything without it, if it is intrinsic, then as nature does it must be intrinsic on other scales. Truth is with or without understanding, our job is to find the understanding that reveals truth, and not create truths that we can understand, because our understanding is always behind.
I agree and am mindful of all that exists that we are not aware of but should seek to find

No. It&#39;s not a shame. Programs such as Mr. Beast helps produce dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins and adrenaline, which people get without using too many areas of their brains.<br><br>But videos like this one, makes use of their brain space and demands for thir active participation towards truly driving them to the solution of a problem, being part of which, not everyone has the patience for. <br><br>Usually when people lose something/ SOMEONE of great importance in their lives, they instantly run towards a dopamine/ adrenaline/ oxytocin boost.

This may lead to existential crises: what if there‚Äôs a copy of me with exactly the same memory
There are infinite copies of you with exactly the same memory
Don&#39;t worry if there are infinite instances of you and me that have the exact same memories. All of them are causality isolated. It is the same if they don&#39;t exist at all. Sorry about my English. It&#39;s just another bad infinite repited memory haha
Then they would be in the same places you or they would have to hurt memories. <br><br>You are forming new memories right now and if they&#39;re the same as someone else&#39;s you would be them.<br><br>So it&#39;s impossible
Then that person  will also be in existential crisis
That would not happen because in the moment somebody exactly as you, with the same memories, exists in a different position in space from you, your personalities start to deviate and become different persons.When you look at him your watching maybe a house in the background and he may be watching the sun rise, at that moment you&#39;re a completely different individual.

It is quite full of ignorant prejudice of Zurbuchen to think that advanced civilizations would have settlements on multiple planets. It means that he&#39;s ignorant about the macro-ethical reasons for why that&#39;d be avoided by any civilization.

Great talk, Brian! I have a question - Hayabusa2 found 20,000 organic molecules which is basically a VERY TINY number. For reference Avogadro number is 6.023*10^23 so 2*10^4 is a very small number. How are we then so sure that it is from a primordial asteroid and not leakage from earth&#39;s atmosphere or some earth-origin dust particle. Even an entropic argument seems to be in favor of a leakage into the sample collector (there could be innumerable ways of leaking such a minuscule number of molecules). <br><br>How do we definitively know that the sample is 100.00% from that asteroid.
Great to see live WSF meeting.

The cost of rocket production has gone down 1/3 because it is now non-union, low benefit, private sector employment working for stock options rather than benefits. It has little to do with 24 hr shift work. Come on Mr. Zurbuchen. Not to turn the conversation into a labor dispute, but it may be greed or the motivation for wealth that drives down costs at the front end. There has been a cultural shift in that regard since the early space program. How do scientists negotiate that phenomenon?

No inhabitant of planet Earth has ever been in outer space. It seems that the Russians are showing the video with Gagarin as an ‚Äúexcursion‚Äù to Kazakhstan. One day you were visited by a ‚Äúguest from the future‚Äù to check who really lives on planet Earth. It took her two years to get here. She told how to remake the rocket for her in order to be able to return home. Unfortunately, she was handcuffed to the rocket to prevent her from getting back. Documentary footage can be seen in the clips that are now on YouTube ‚ÄúDream Theme‚Äù ‚Äî –¢–µ–º–∞ –º–µ—á—Ç—ã, (‚ÄúTravel with an Astronaut‚Äù) - –ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Å –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–æ–º, ‚ÄúBlue Planet‚Äù ‚Äì –ì–æ–ª—É–±–∞—è –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞. The rocket was boarded and thus she was able to return. The clips contain videos with footage of men who have nothing to do with astronautics. There is another video where you can see how she ‚Äúcame to visit,‚Äù where first one and then another parachute opens for insurance, having met a woman and a girl named Evgenia. The video ‚ÄúDream Theme‚Äù ‚Äî –¢–µ–º–∞ –ú–µ—á—Ç—ã ends, a video in which boys are running around some barrel and a bandy-legged man in an orange jumpsuit specially made for him for just walking. For your information, in Outer Space you need a spaceship and not only.... The melody for the Clips was written and played with the German orchestra from Cologne by Sofia-Galinka Romanyuk in 1970 in Moscow. The clips for the singing girl were created on Planet Uranus. She explained the laws of physics to Cosmos researchers, and many of them immediately became ‚Äúgreat scientists.‚Äù An anecdote from that time.<br>One party official of the USSR (you probably know at what time the country began to be called that) once said: ‚ÄúAmong the great Soviet (derived from the word advice) physicists, there are only Jews: Ioffe, Landau, Ginsburg, etc.... It‚Äôs good that there is at least one Russian ‚Äì Khalatnikov.‚Äù Yes, they answered him. Only Isaac Markovich remained. This means that the ‚Äúdiscoveries‚Äù of that time were taken from the Archives of the Civilization that existed here before.<br>–ù–∏ –æ–¥–∏–Ω –∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å –∏–∑ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã –ó–µ–º–ª—è –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª –≤ –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ. –ü–æ—Ö–æ–∂–µ, –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ —Å –ì–∞–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω—ã–º —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–µ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –∫–∞–∫ &quot;—ç–∫—Å–∫—É—Ä—Å–∏—é&quot; –≤ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∂–¥—ã –í–∞—Å –ø–æ—Å–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∞ &quot;–≥–æ—Å—Ç—å—è –∏–∑ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–≥–æ&quot;, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –∫—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–º–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–µ –∂–∏–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –ó–µ–º–ª—è. –ï–π –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –¥–≤–∞ –≥–æ–¥–∞, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –¥–æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —Å—é–¥–∞. –û–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–ª—è –Ω–µ–µ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç—É, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∏–º–µ—Ç—å –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –¥–æ–º–æ–π. –ö —Å–æ–∂–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é, –µ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–≤—è–∑–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä—É—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ –∫ —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–µ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–µ –¥–∞—Ç—å –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥. –î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∫–∞–¥—Ä—ã –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å –≤ –∫–ª–∏–ø–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤ YouTube ¬´–¢–µ–º–∞ –º–µ—á—Ç—ã¬ª(¬´–ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Å –ö–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–æ–º¬ª),¬´–ì–æ–ª—É–±–∞—è –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞¬ª. –†–∞–∫–µ—Ç—É –≤–∑—è–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –ê–±–æ—Ä–¥–∞–∂ –∏ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º –æ–Ω–∞ —Å–º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è. –í –∫–ª–∏–ø–∞—Ö –≤–º–æ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ —Å –∫–∞–¥—Ä–∞–º–∏ –º—É–∂—á–∏–Ω –Ω–µ –∏–º–µ—é—â–∏–º–∏ –Ω–∏–∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–∏–∫–µ. –ï—Å—Ç—å –µ—â–µ –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Ä–æ–ª–∏–∫, –≥–¥–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫ –æ–Ω–∞ ¬´–ø—Ä–∏—à–ª–∞ –≤ –≥–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª, –≥–¥–µ —Ä–∞—Å–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ –æ–¥–∏–Ω, –∞ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä–∞—à—é—Ç –¥–ª—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–æ–≤–∫–∏, –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–≤ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω—É –∏ –¥–µ–≤—É—à–∫—É –ø–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ó–∞–∫–∞–Ω—á–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–ª–∏–ø ¬´–¢–µ–º–∞ –º–µ—á—Ç—ã¬ª, –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏—à–∫–∏ –±–µ–≥–∞—é—Ç –≤–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ –∫–∞–∫–æ–π-—Ç–æ –±–æ—á–∫–∏ –∏ –∏–¥–µ—Ç –∫—Ä–∏–≤–æ–Ω–æ–≥–∏–π –º—É–∂–∏–∫ –≤ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø–æ—à–∏—Ç–æ–º –¥–ª—è –Ω–µ–≥–æ –æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∂–µ–≤–æ–º –∫–æ–º–±–∏–Ω–µ–∑–æ–Ω–µ. –ö —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—é, –≤ –ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ –≤–∞–º –Ω—É–∂–µ–Ω –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª—å –∏ –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ.... –ú–µ–ª–æ–¥–∏—é –¥–ª—è –ö–ª–∏–ø–æ–≤ –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∞ –∏ –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç —Å –Ω–µ–º–µ—Ü–∫–∏–º –æ—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–º –∏–∑ –ö—ë–ª—å–Ω–∞ –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è-–ì–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∫–∞ –†–æ–º–∞–Ω—é–∫ –≤ 1970 –≥–æ–¥—É –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ. –ö–ª–∏–ø—ã –¥–ª—è –ø–æ—é—â–µ–π –¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –£—Ä–∞–Ω. –û–Ω–∞ –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω—è–ª–∞ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º ¬´–ö–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–∞¬ª –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–∏ –∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ –∏–∑ –Ω–∏—Ö —Å—Ä–∞–∑—É —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏ ¬´–±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–º–∏ —É—á–µ–Ω—ã–º–∏¬ª. –ê–Ω–µ–∫–¥–æ—Ç —Ç–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏. –û–¥–∏–Ω –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–π–Ω—ã–π —á–∏–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –°–°–°–† (–Ω–∞–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç–µ —Å –∫–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞ —Ç–∞–∫ –Ω–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è) –∫–∞–∫-—Ç–æ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: ¬´–°—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö (–ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –æ—Ç —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç) —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–æ–≤ –æ–¥–Ω–∏ –µ–≤—Ä–µ–∏: –ò–æ—Ñ—Ñ–µ, –õ–∞–Ω–¥–∞—É, –ì–∏–Ω—Å–±—É—Ä–≥ –∏ –¥—Ä‚Ä¶. –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ, —á—Ç–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Ö–æ—Ç—å –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π ‚Äî –•–∞–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤¬ª. –î–∞, –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∏ –µ–º—É. –¢–æ–ª—å–∫–æ, –ò—Å–∞–∞–∫ –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∏—á –∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—Å—è. –≠—Ç–æ –∫ —Ç–æ–º—É, —á—Ç–æ ¬´–æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—è¬ª —Ç–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –≤–∑—è—Ç—ã –∏–∑ –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–æ–≤ –¶–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è —Ç—É—Ç —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ —Ä–∞–Ω—å—à–µ.

Space exploration? More like UNIVERSE DOMINATION and that&#39;s a FACT!
In this era of robotic and ai systems filling less desirable jobs, we need to explore just for job creation. <br><br>Another benefit, Steven Hawking says some disaster will make humans on earth extinct, other estimates less then 1 million, or as soon as 500 million years. <br><br>With the technology we learn from habitating Mars, will be needed here in earth with in this 1000 year to 500 million years and before earth becomes hazardous to life. <br><br>Being prepared to create sustainable life should be the first concern, and we learn that by taking Mars.
If it wasn‚Äôt for science‚Ä¶ we would not have the things we have today.

That life will be found on other planets, or moons in our galaxy is a given. The bigger question will be the origin of it. The Chicxulub asteroid killed off the dinosaurs when it hit the Yucat√°n Peninsula 66 million years ago. 25 trillion tons of material (50,000 cubic miles) were ejected from the crater, some of it left the earth&#39;s orbit. Some organisms can survive in space. Over 250 different species of bacteria and fungi can survive, and thrive in outer space The ejected material would have spread through our galaxy like a cloud, and it could have ended up on all the celestial bodies where it could have reproduced. So......yes life forms will be found in our galaxy, but the odds are that it was probably transported from earth 66million years ago.
What about hydrogen from the sun mixing with oxygen in our atmosphere to create our water, star water.

What a dumb debate.
Don&#39;t focus on distant fantasies. Planet earth and masses of suffering human beings are in desperate need of attention and improvements. Outerspace for the satellites necessary for international communications and weather observations is one thing. Beyond that it&#39;s a total scam, a waste, a selfish, criminal action by a clever, shrewd bunch of devils who are exploiting the masses to fund their hobby. üòâ
The golden age of space exploration has yet to begin. India, China, the ESA are making big steps. More startups are joining the race, more countries like Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia are enhancing their space tech. <br>Shit is going to be good

I would hope in 100 years we will be interstellar. There need to be some modification to general  relativity to make this happen.
Don&#39;t hold your breath on breaking general relativity.
What needs be found is not a problem with relativity, that&#39;s pretty solid.  It will take insight, and technological developments we can&#39;t really imagine at this time.  But, on the scale of that technological development, a century is quite a big chunk of time.  What&#39;s the answer?  Who knows.  I left my crystal ball behind on the first  trans-pacific passenger flight, only 33 years after the Wright Brothers&#39; first brief, powered, sustained, and controlled airplane flight (1903).<br>But, manned interstellar in a single human lifetime beginning less than a century from now is probably a stretch.  Sadly, nobody in this conversation will live long enough to see the departure even in the best-case scenario.

What a BORING discourse! Nothing new, no revelations.......NASA guy is quite amusing......Prof Greene must&#39;ve thought the same as myself and many others. Dull, dull, dull.....

lunatics still talking about black holes, dark energy and matter, big bang, expanding universe or age of universe...people long time know that these are silly fantasies
None is out there looking for us.<br>They are looking at us, a fallen world.
Let&#39;s face it. All this interest &amp; hype about the moon etc right now owe it to China. Just like how in the past the Soviet Union launched the US into a space race in the 60s. And to talk of a golden age of space exploration in the next few decades without also talking about what China &amp; Russia is doing is I think a ridiculously stunning, foolish, unscientific omission, on a bigger scale than the foolishness of banning China from the ISS.

Enough of the vaccine propaganda. So thankful I didn‚Äôt take that poison.
On the subject of ChatGPT... please do an updated episode on AI soon! I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you could get Sam Altman on if you approached him through the right channels. He, somebody like Matt Wolfe (who is very up-to-date on AI developments), and two AI researchers/developers/ethicists who can discuss and ask questions about technical details would be a really interesting synergy.
Do you think that the opening joke, particularly the answer: &quot;You asked me to deliver the joke in the voice of Brian Green&quot; is true?
Very cool stuff.
Perhaps a better joke would have been: &quot;Why did the astronaut cross the black hole?&quot;  The same punchline, &quot;to get to the other side of the universe.&quot;  OK, so I&#39;m not a professional comedy writer.
An intelligence superseding us by a billion years. Sheesh. We could be staring &quot;them&quot; right in the face and not even recognize it as life. They would be unimaginably different.
I don&#39;t think so. The elements that make us would be the same elements that make them. I imagine all life in the universe is much more similar to earth organisms than we think.
The probabilistic argument about so many galaxies with so many stars is very one sided. Approach it from the other end. Take all the billions of steps that had to go &#39;right&#39; to get something like us here and consider the probability of those step happening and happening in a sufficiently short time frame so all those billions of step could happen within the lifetime of the universe. If in those billions of steps you can find a few dozen that had only a 50% chance of happening there is statistically less than 1 civilization in the visible universe. It is easy to believe that given the numbers of stars it&#39;s a statistical certainty we&#39;re not alone, but if you dive into the statistics of what had to happen to get us here it&#39;s equally easy to conclude that the odds are so stacked against it that it&#39;s a statistical certainty we are alone. Without a decent understanding of what it takes to get life started, what is needed to get to technology and all the ways that life can be wiped out or set back it&#39;s essentially impossible to say whether we&#39;re alone unless we find another civilization. Based on what know now, we can conclude the universe is teeming with life, we&#39;re alone or anything in between with equally reasonable assumptions. <br><br>That all said, if you&#39;ve to make a bet, bet on technological life is out there. Though based on what we know scientifically dubious, it&#39;s a position that is &#39;easy&#39; to be proven correct and virtually impossible to be proven wrong while the position of we&#39;re alone is virtually impossible to be proven right and &#39;easy&#39; to be proven wrong.
really? did they go to the moon? I do not thing so !!!
Are you a smart person? I do not &quot;thing&quot; so !!!
We went to the moon, you absolute brainlet.
This program is airing simultaneously with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Once we worked with Russia.  I am thinking about the recurring theme of Star Trek.  World War III.

Aude &amp; Thomas both dodged Brian&#39;s question about risking human lives.  That&#39;s a crucial difference in approach.  SpaceX built Dragon to meet NASA&#39;s safety requirements,  but future companies could fly any janky missions so long as the crew sign their disclaimers.  It&#39;ll speed up expansion in capabilities enormously.
I dunno...  The Titan didn&#39;t do much to advance deep sea exploration...
Yes, much of what I was taught years ago is outdated.  That‚Äôs OK and I am aware that it is outdated because of cutting edge science that is becoming known to me through this program!  What an exciting time to be alive!
interesting conversation, good question of topic to be honest eventhough some were not answered. its is hard.
Thank you very much for this very interesting event.<br>There is hope for the earth and the humans if we can work together across the borders.<br>If the population are contiuing to increase on earth we will need to colonice Mars and other planets.<br>Let Science bring peace amoung people all over the world and i am sure that in a hundred year the world will be a better place for all of us.<br>There is no limit out there so let go for it....üëç‚ù§Ô∏è

The most difficult part of searching for Extraterrestrial  signals/Extraterrestrial Life is as in the Drake equation,<br><br>N = <br>R* x Fp x Nc x. Fl x Fi x Fc x L<br><br>Where N is the # of intelligent civilizations capable of communication with us ...<br><br> R* is the rate of star formation with in the Milkyway Galaxy ...<br><br>Fp is the # fraction of stars that have planets in the habitable zone<br><br>Nc is the # of planets that could support life per star with planets<br><br>FL is the fraction of life-supporting planets that develop life<br><br>Fi the fraction of those planets that support life develop intelligence<br><br>Fc is the fraction of intelligent civilizations that develop communication tech<br><br>L = The TIME that those communication capable intelligent civilizations exist <br><br>I think eventually each of the variables will eventually have a relative number assigned. As future discovery and exploration answers these questions <br><br>If you start out with 300 billion stars and we now know that on average,<br><br> every star has planets the average number of planets orbiting in the habitable zone per star =1<br><br>This gives us 300 billion planets that are in the habitable zone of there relative star. <br><br>If 1% of those 300 billion planets develop life ... this gives us 3 billion planets supporting life <br><br>If 1% of those 3 billion planets that support life develop intelligent civilizations, <br><br>this  gives us 30,000,000 intelligent civilizations in our galaxy alone <br><br>If 1% of those 30 million intelligent civilizations are capable of communicating with us, there would be 300,000 Extraterrestrial civilizations capable of communicating with us in our own galaxy    BUT    the last part of the equation has a degree of difficulty that is literally astronomical  ... The longevity factor ... how long an intelligent communicating civilization can exist. <br><br>Since humanity has only existed as a civilization for approximately 75,000 years and the Milkyway is approximately 13.2 billion years old<br><br>Space-Time could be the dimension that prevents us from being aware of a universe so   complex ....It would be like if our universe were only 2 dimensions ... existing in a 2 dimensional  universe, we would only know about width and length ... <br><br>Discovering Extraterrestrial Life, even if just fossilized microbes, would be the most profound discovery in human history
I think the Fermi Paradox is probable. We will probably destroy ourselves with advanced technology weapons . The warning signs are already visible .Do you think the likes of Russia, with such weapons ,won&#39;t end in disaster .It won&#39;t matter who else exists in the Universe .When we are capable enough , we are destructive enough.
Physics is badazz.
Excellent show. Brian is a great interviewer. I was unaware of the details of these coming missions. So exciting.
How&#39;d they get out of the prime directive question?

I&#39;m hoping that in 100 years we have moved on into and past our solar system, and have at least sent a probe to a neighboring system, maybe Alpha Centauri ?
In a hundred years I hope we are building interstellar spaceships

we would likely have to build a large amount of infrastructure first in the Sol system before considered leaving into interstellar space.

To my mind, I would say that having a remote simulated gravity space station orbiting around the sun in the asteroid belt, would be the most economical solution to long term space habitability. Since many of the required resources are already there for the taking (metals, water, fuels, etc.) and they aren&#39;t trapped by planetary gravity which makes them relatively easy to mine and transport.
Smash The rocks together. Asteroid belt. We can build a new planet with gravity and all. engineer a a nice sustainable nuclear reaction in the middle. put in pipe works as we smash the rocks together. This is the Intelligent choice.
Are these only live in Australia? I would love to listen to something like this in person but I&#39;m in Texas. Either way, thank you wsf and Dr Greene!!
I think they&#39;re normally in New York (but I could be mistaken).  I was surprised when they mentioned this one is in Australia.
Thank you sir

Love Brian also. We have no evidence yet for life out there but just the fact many government agency have pretty much accepted the possibility of life out there. Just that acceptance, without evidence speaks volumes. Govt saying ‚Äúyes, there probably out there‚Äù so what.
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for having me. You know, recently NASA was considering sending me to space to study string theory. But they quickly changed their minds when they realized, in zero gravity, it&#39;s impossible to keep the strings from tangling!&quot;<br>Yep, not very good yet.
I dont understand why we&#39;re needing this new tecnologies, big preparation and training to send men on the moon! We&#39;ve already done in 1969! Am I right?
Yeah, but wasn&#39;t very safe, killed three people on the ground, and almost killed another three in space(from 24 that were launched in whole program ) , and only 12 humans walked on the moon, and for very short periods of time (like some only few hours and others only a little more than two days ), we will need to make those things safer and continuous , and with all tehnologycal progress of the last 50 years we actually are knowing very little about the moon(the closest celestial bodies, witch should be the most knowed ) , so are good reasons to send humans again on the moon surface, and even beyond.
Turned off the video at exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm8OHGvl4Oc&amp;t=324">5:24</a>, after the speaker brought op covid-, only to spread lies about it and push the lying mainstream narrative/agenda. How much did you get paid to push their agenda?<br>&quot;Vaccines being tested&quot;, they obviously weren&#39;t tested in that extremely short period. The many casuals and people who are still suffering from them, are proof of that.<br>It has NOT &quot;helped&quot; us get back to a more normal life. The covid period was there for the biggest wealth transfer in our history, from the normies and poor to the richest 1% &#39;elites&#39;. It was there to enforce and test more control over us by the government. The elite like Bill Gates, big tech and governments were never this aligned at forcing more control over us to push their evil agenda&#39;s.<br>Won&#39;t listen to-, or watch a thing from this POS. Hard down vote.
Excellent scientists keep the good jobs..
100 yes from now I hope we will manipulate the seven galaxy or universe and use them efficiently sufficiently and sustainable..

How could you have this conversation and not mention spaceX. They are literally paving the way in this area and changed the way we do everything space. I donno man im a huge fan of wsf but this is inscrutable.
they did mention it

Demons aren&#39;t real, numb nuts.
Humans in space to learn sustainability?   Pure BS.   It&#39;s easier to learn how to do that without adding the difficulty of space into the equation.  And we haven&#39;t bothered to learn it on earth so why will adding the huge difficulty and expense of space change things?   All nonsense.   And we&#39;ll send humans for &quot;inspiration&quot;?  Sheesh.  Grow up, people?
It&#39;s a good thing people like you are few to non existent in the scientific community. If humanity as a whole agreed with your abysmal outlook, we would&#39;ve never reached the level of technology and knowledge we have today.<br><br>Here&#39;s a tip: Speak less, and listen more. You might learn something.
I disagree.  Everything up through Apollo and Shuttle was just our down payment. I believe we are now entering &quot;the golden age of space exploration. &quot;  If you agree, please give it a thumbs up üëç
Correction.  I shall call Apollo,  The Shuttle,  and ISS as a proof of concept.  What happens next will become the Golden Age.  <br><br>But what will happen after that?  The real road block is what happens when we&#39;re ready to move out of our solar system?
Nobody mentioned that the supposed chances of life elsewhere are entirely dependent on the assumptions behind genesis of life on earth - a complete unknown.  The chances were considered high (because of so many planets) and yet when considering the level of  development of any alien civilization the chances were considered to be &quot;nil&quot; that they would be at our own developmental level.  Nobody minds making assertions that life is &quot;certain&quot; elsewhere yet the chances of it being at same level are &quot;nil&quot;?  This is really bad reasoning!  <br><br>Nobody knows what the likelihood of life is.  So far all the evidence is life has only happened once - here on earth.  This is too uncomfortable for folks to grok?

No one likes to discuss Venus.
People speaking about space exploration when we haven&#39;t even explored our own planet is perplexing.  We&#39;ve dug a mere 7.5 miles into the Earth.  We don&#39;t know much about our own planet yet carry such hubris about our understanding &amp; abilities to explore other planets.

I remember when Hubble launched, I was almost 14 years old. They were going to build the Terrestrial Planet Finder telescope, but it was canceled in 2011. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it happens again.

Brian is so good to make complicated terms easy to understand by a layman. And his presence on stage is so laid-back. He&#39;s a gem in the Physics world
In an ideal world, every country would be forced to spend certain percentage of its military budget (say 10%) on scientific space program.I mean, they are hell bent to destroy the planet, then they should also invest in seeking for plan-B worlds.<br>That means, the increased $$$ in these programs would attract more talented guys. The way I see it now, these people in this sector are not the most intelligent or innovative bunch humanity can offer.

The most important fundamental you need to recognize is the very first verse of the Bible  IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. Genesis 1:1. Why because you are dealing with a mathematical problem that is backed by intelligence. Until then you can understand nothing about the Truth of Creation .

5,312 confirmed planets outside of our solar system...pretty cool data!!
Very interesting, but how many times did the folks say, &quot;actually&quot;? I gave up counting.
I tend to disagree with the 20 to 30 year time span of insights gleaned from the JWST, especially with the advent of AI.  The speed of data analysis and insights from it is set to change exponentially.
I would like to witness each of these scientists, human beings, looking directly into the camera and asking the political, corporate and religious leaders, from all over planet earth, one question. &quot;When collaborating scientist, from all over planet earth, discover life elsewhere, out in the cosmos, will you &quot;leaders&quot; attempt to destroy that life as you attempt to destroy life on planet earth every day? üò¢

Part 3: I personally think that applying the required habitability conditions for ourselves to other planets is a huge disservice to science especially based on temperature. It basically assumes other living organisms would need the same conditions we do. When it&#39;s argued that we evolved om this planet. While other organisms could evolve uniquely on their planet. We still don&#39;t know without a doubt that there&#39;s no living organisms on the planets within our own solar system.
Part 1: &quot;Dark matter&quot; is completely speculation and theory. Despite millions if not billions of dollars no models or the particle Collider has proven. It&#39;s amusing to see them play with the term &quot;dark energy&quot;, while trying to avoid the word &quot;electricity&quot;. They are trying their hardest to not acknowledge that there&#39;s more proof of an &quot;Electric Universe&quot;. Which some test have shown similar if not the same type of spiral formations of galaxies. Which is far closer to providing an explanation of the formation of galaxies than the made up &quot;dark matter&quot; theories.

My goodness, Australian scientists sound as if they have marbles in their mouths.  The first guy Carl is clearly intelligent but was barely comprehensible.  And if the lady in part two , Michelle, is a lead science communicator, then it really speaks to how far behind in science communication Aussies have to go, particularly when you compare them to how easy to understand their American counterparts are.  It&#39;s not just a question of accent, but of clarity of expression.  Weird.
No scientific background of my own. Yet having watched all the WSF features, all of the ‚ÄúHistory of the Universe‚Äù and ‚ÄúKosmos‚Äù channel videos I truly applaud the effort and work of these brilliant minds to bring about and share their discoveries with all of Mankind.

hey, I&#39;m just a plumber it&#39;s plumbing some shit. What is the fact that aliens are seeing with big eyes indicates that they may have pain from two off red stars. Big eyes means low light long wavelength.
Eyes are for studying the composition of milky way galaxy. Good experience from this conversation.
Junk science.
fantastic, fantasic discoveries, fantastic, but we are not going to tell you what is fantastic. that is so fantastic!
OMG, all they show are simulations, cartoons. DID WEBB BLOW UP?<br>ANSWER ME THIS<br>Since galaxies travel in space time as they cross the universe, emitting light along the way, then we should be able to observe the same galaxy at different places in the sky, different places in the life of the galaxy and universe, by figuring out the direction of the galaxy and its speed, then mapping the universe forward and backward in spacetime and making observations there. IN OTHER WORDS,, as an example, If Galaxy A is observed to be 1 billion light years away when the telescope aims at in say in Andromeda, and we could extrapolate or guess which way it came and/or which way it is going then we could find it elsewhere in the sky, say at 2 billion years ago, and half a billion years ago. WHERE IS THIS WRONG?
This is an interesting question. I believe in order to observe an object at two difference places in spacetime simultaneously from our perspective, that object would need to be moving faster than the speed of light (which, according to our current understanding, is not possible).<br>Imagine holding a laser pointer and pointing its laser at a wall. You can move your arm up and down as fast as you want, but at any given moment, the laser will only be hitting the wall at a single point. If your arm could teleport upward instantaneously (ignoring the speed of light), only then would the laser hit the wall at two places at once. Earth is the wall, observing incoming light;<br>The laser pointer is the galaxy we wish to observe;<br>The laser itself is the light emitting from that galaxy, traveling towards Earth.<br>The laser pointer has to move faster than its laser in order for lasers to hit the wall at two points simultaneously. Similarly, the galaxy would have to move faster than its emitted light to be seen by the Earth in two points simultaneously.
Your answer starts off funny. &quot;... to observe an object at two different places in spacetime simultaneously from our perspective&quot; The observer is also our perspective, right? The observer is at on point in spacetime, let&#39;s call it the present. The thing we are observing is not visible because it&#39;s light of the present is leaving it and will take light eons to reach us where we were at what we called the present, now far away and in the past. Light is fast, but not instantaneous. Space is big, real big. We see the light of the object from the past as it reaches us from a time and place long ago and far away (don&#39;t even think about light traveling in a straight line, it does, but it&#39;s not necessary for our problem). That light has reached our present. We look in a different part of the sky. We see an object whose light has reached us in the present, that light traveled from somewhere far away and in a different place. If we could map a trajectory between those two lights, at appropriate speed and direction, we could show those are the same object, changed and shaped by space and time. QED LOL   Let me add this. SUPPOSE the light is from a galaxy and that galaxy is orbiting in a cluster. We might be able to analyze the cluster in multiple projections. It might even end up on one exposure from Webb 13 billion light years, more and less, a few rotations...
Well u zoom telescope at point B in space and then wait billion plus few years to see the light from this galaxy when it gets to point B?
They are just all so positive and pleasant to listen to .. ..AND...may I add (?) They are just so talented....Here you can clearly see that it really is the &quot;desire&quot; that makes the work! What a great enthusiasm they show! They love their job...nice to watch...Bravo !<br><br>Imagine if ALL workplaces had such a cool atmosphere?? Ohhh? haha! .üòÅ
More raw data next to composite images is required to afford the credibility to such necessary explorations.

Hi John
But i am tired,
Well I tell u my friend how is it
Yes my friend  sir green, if I can‚Äôt figure it in his actions,  im going to  his words
Hey guys. I have an idea. What about we consider that the backhoes in the centre of each galaxy could be the place that some kind of existence enters our universe and it converts to matter and energy in our universe. Like when water makes a vortex  as it sinks in a hole, the other side of the hole it forms an expanding vortex. For an observer who looks at this vortex from the other side it look like all the water is turning around a space that there&#39;s no water in it at all. Maybe we are on the other side of a vortex that connects our universe to the other universe. Ofcourse we need to create a mathematical model for this idea
Surely it&#39;s now logical reasoning that indeed the Timeline for the Big Bang has to be wrong or even if there was an event that was not the first Big Bang. It&#39;s all because this incredible piece of Human scientific engineering tech James Webb has now been discovered with redshift tech, proving that it is not 13.8  billion years. IF as reported observed Stars and Galaxys further away in time anything viewed beyond the 13.8 Billion cut-offs must make that number redundant. I have never understood the evidence or reasons that there was indeed nothing before this massive event, I have always leaned on the theory of a coming together of two supermassive Black Holes a massive singularity event that was a dominant presence in a much smaller uncluttered farther spread out universe. It&#39;s a human trait that you must have a start and end all things are not finite, and space is not defined like that nothing scientifically allows something to come from that nothing it does not, relatively speaking for every action there is a reaction cause, and effect. Now with quantum mechanics what relativity thought to be nothing was actually something. Now incorporating a quantum field a vacuum is no longer vacuous or empty with many subatomic particles in residence. to me traveling back to any Galaxy that is as old as 12 plus billion years mean that these galaxies all took million of years to be able to form and there way before the theoretical age of the Universe.

i really dont get all those Trump bashing tbh, it&#39;s ridiculous, on other part of the world we get it, you dont like him, he looks stupid, said things that are stupid, but unlike his opponents he doesn&#39;t have blood on his hand and speak what he think is the truth, he may be corrupted in the business, but certainly not to the extent others are, Obama, Biden, Bush, Clinton, those have bloods on their hands everybody knows this.<br>So actually, i&#39;m really wondering why is it that Trump is always treated like this.<br>You guys should make yourselves a favor, and just stop with that.
Legit question to all scientists. When are we going to get the star trek &quot;telescope&quot; what I mean is how they can zoom in like a camera across light-years of distance and read the name on the other guys ship. Why can we not zoom in with our space observatories
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. One paper using discredited old hypothesis did not overturn current lamda CDM model of our universe.
THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE GOING UP IN SMOKE !!!<br>So Good bye &quot;Big Bang, and &quot;Expanding Universe&quot;. Which certain branches of Science have always pointed out, are PURELY HYPOTHETICAL ! <br>MATHEMATICS you need to understand is NOT part of Science, despite Albert Einsteins best attempts to convince people otherwise !!!<br>THE ABUSE OF THE DOPPLER EFFECT referred to as Blue or Red shift, is claimed to prove Galaxies are moving towards or away from each other. But as MANY real Research Scientists have repeatedly PROVEN. IT IS NOT the Doppler effect that accounts for nearly all Galaxies being slightly red or occasionally blue ! Galaxies with a red tint (around 90%) is because 75% of all stars in the Universe are small red dwarfs. Virtually invisible singularly but on mass account for the red tint. Blue being rare accounts for the occasional Galaxy that has a high quantity of very large Blue White Stars, such as our neighbouring Galaxy Andromeda. Which is NOT going to crash into our Galaxy at all, as its blue tint has nothing to do with movement, and everything to do with its high percentage of very large blue white stars.  <br>Sadly this &quot;LECTURE&quot; is 90% THEORETICAL GARBAGE - SO NOT FACTUAL PROVEN SCIENCE.
PHILOSOPHY - TODAY THEY CALL IT THEORETICAL SCIENCE - ARE WE BEING CONNED ? <br>THEORY as your dictionary will tell you means: Quote &quot;A collection of IDEAS&quot; Unquote.<br>So EVERYTHING a Theoretical Scientist (PHILOSOPHER) says, does NOT NEED to be proven ! Indeed there is so much money is this deceptive field today, that it now accounts for 50% of the people making up the &quot;American Scientific Community&quot;. And yet they deal in Philosophy, which they now want to call THEORETICAL SCIENCE. This is a BRAZEN CON, AND NOT FACTUAL RESEARCH SCIENCE AT ALL !!!<br><br>Before ANY THEORY can be raised to the level of SCIENTIFIC LAW, research has to be completed, producing the EVIDENCE to support the THEORY, before the relevant INSTITUTE for that branch of Science, sits to consider the evidence, upon which they can either refuse or raise the Theory to SCIENTIFIC LAW.<br><br> But of course these &quot;Theoretical Scientists&quot; have already got their money giving talks like the one above, where tickets are now in excess of $250+ each. So Research, Proof, not on your life, this monkey Brian Greene is just another clever CON Artist !
LOGICAL...Universe since then is ALREADY INFINITE,I don&#39;t know why This some Scientists they BELIEVE in the Wrong Thing.. How can you BELIEVE in big Bang..it came from NOTHING...that is Stupidity..I give an Example..do you think you can control your Satellite or what ever machine you invented without Human Control or Created to move that machine... that&#39;s a BIG BIG IMPOSSIBLE.I don&#39;t know why humans are Scientists Brain is only an ATOM compared to the brain of the CREATOR.üòÖ

Brian Greene skipped over her opportunity to close out with her concept or exoplanets
Maybe soon we will see JWST data help refine and revise our various standard candles.
Alway brilliant üëç
I mean seriously, our observational capabilities have gone through a couple magnitudes in the last 100 years. It&#39;s as bananas as going from Wright brothers to Apollo landings in 70 years.
... many ? ... few ! ... JWST appears to have humbled us, to the point of realizing the extent of the speculative nature of our physical sciences ... a giant step forward ... also interesting the high degree of speculation, qualification and apparent evasion of revealing possible factual information here ... seems that it is very difficult to reveal that the answers simply are not measurably known ... the third segment guests are refreshingly candid about this ... bravo ...onward ...
Thanks for the the interview.
I just heard that the universe is now older than about 24 billion LY.
When I first started watching Brian Greene on the stream presenting talks on quantum mechanics, physics experiments, he was just about the age of these young scientists. It&#39;s a testament to Greene how many audiences he has reached bringing the message of the cosmos to the world.
I enjoyed watching all the various Cosmology in Crisis presentations on different channels.

This should be hyped as the scientific comic con. Or the NBA finals or super bowl. Get Neil deGrasse Tyson to host it. Children could actually get hyped about science. (Public)Schools shows you one tray at a time and hopes you see the forest at the end
Thanks to all of for taking time &amp; sharing the exciting findings!
Brian Greene my good sir, please tell us about the non-human intelligences lol
Jon Evans put it together. The Universe is not expanding. It is easily looked at as a giant ball of energy (the Higgs Field) as energy spins and becomes quarks atoms matter galaxies and so forth. It moves through space along filaments INWARD. The CMB moves in our location at 67.5 m/s The Galaxies at 74m/s (byebye expansion of space and anyone who tries to use it any longer. you shall be tar&#39;d and feathered) As these galaxies move inward they form clusters and move toward the center of Gravity. The Great Attractor in our case and then the SHapely Super Cluster. DARK FLOW is the (only dark word that has any truth to it) flow of everything moving toward that location. Eventually things will turn into black holes and hawking radiation and one giant party at the end of &quot;time&quot; (thats for another episode) Time is Energy. Time/Energy=Mc2. All Matter is spinning energy. Spinning Energy combines to slow down time. Lots of Spinning Energy = Gravity Wells aka black holes and such. Light Has Energy. Light gets Bent by Higher densities of Energy. You all just solved everything by reading this. The Universe is infinite. Time is relative to the observer. The observer being the Higgs field aka the Universe is it starts on the outskirts and moves toward the center of gravity for the easiest image to make in your mind.
Wonderful knowledge üëç
We are looking at millions and millions of years back in time. What we are looking at do not exist anymore. <br>Galaxies are even a life on other planets are endless.
Shameful ‚Ä¶. Brilliant but has to go and insult half of America that actually appreciated what Trump did for the economy‚Ä¶.  Biden has been a fumbling joke‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt have to be a scientist to see that. Anyone liking their out of this world grocery bills lately???
New view, new theories.
How it started is out of our reach, what&#39;s even further away is the why. Most humans think it blew from a tiny point it&#39;s how big that point was we don&#39;t know yet. My hat of to all scientists, because what they have achieved since their coming into being in their field&#39;s. Jaw dropping. ü§ìüññ‚úåÔ∏è
Awesome. This kind of stuff makes me proud to be a human.
Fascinating!
Trust your kings.<br>We are doing our best to get it working.<br>I am not going to back down.<br>Be a rainbow today.<br>Let us move together.
From a layman‚Äôs perspective I see three possibilities so far:<br><br>1. The Universe is far older and the calculations from what has been largely thought of as reliable data is simply incorrect.<br><br>2. Galaxies formed much faster in the early Universe (with very different characteristics) due to concentrations of dark energy.<br><br>3. This one is reaching out there - The gravitational lensing is far more powerful than calculated and we are actually seeing galaxies from an earlier or even a neighboring Universe? If so, wouldn‚Äôt it render our distance data irrelevant‚Ä¶or is that just nuts? Please someone let me know if it is.

I loved it all right up until you decided that advanced alien civilizations would question human reasoning based on Trump&#39;s election... you don&#39;t think that the past 100+ years with Hitler, Stalin, the holocaust, Vietnam, Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Rwanda, Bosnia, weaponized viruses, human trafficking, global warming, etc etc would be what would disappoint or disgust an intelligent civilization? Really? Trump? üò¢
The fact you brought politics into this by disparaging Donald Trump is really disappointing  it shows that even at your level of intellect  you are still capable of falling foul of indoctrination and irrational hate makes me think maybe we aren&#39;t ready to interact with other intelligent life
They know absolutely nothing about whats happening out there, pretending that whatever they make up is whats actually happening, WTF do they know about what happened back then??!! They ask such stupid questions!
On a read between the lines level Brian Greene is an absolute savage on many occasions
These images are disproving all their theories.  Totally destroying their false narrative.  So they have to come up with another theory to propagate their Big Bust.
Does anyone else find it interesting that the two snapshots of the pillars of creation (shown during the opening) show so little change in the gas cloud&#39;s size and shape? Really brings home how large and far away these things must be. Does anyone know offhand how many years between the two snapshots?

@@DaytonWhite96 everyone has an opinion. Glad I&#39;m not getting canceled for expressing mine.
It seems we have a long way to go.  Our understanding of the universe is changing as data comes from James Webb.<br>Thank you very much for this wonderful program Prof. Brian Greene
Can we gat a IMAX movie of the discoveries.  I&#39;d love that and I&#39;m sure many others would.
I love Brian Greene...ty for all you do....
If by big bang everything started at once, so how can we see the past events like formation of stars, why every particle in universe is not on same time frame as it started in same moment of big bang.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=800">13:20</a> - Am I watching a Monty Python skit? Do these people really get paid for this? There are millions of people doing important jobs that directly affect our lives every day that don&#39;t make a fraction of the money that these unproductive scientists do! I find that a reordering of the universe is in order!
Just like the &quot;scientists&quot; of the past thought that the Earth was the center of the Universe, we now believe that just on the edge of our observable universe are the very first galaxies and stars! Such hubris and obnoxious selfishness. Unbecomming of science and true knowledge!
So predictable! Yes. I have been saying this forever! Theoretical Physics is extremely tenuous physics.
I look forward to this Festival every year.
Pure gold!
If it takes billions of years for the light/image of far away objects in the universe to reach earth then how do we know of any of that stuff is even still there? We could just be looking back in history instead of what is presently there today. I just wonder if we had the ability to travel faster than the speed of light when it would be that the images we see through our telescopes would fade away and we would see the reality of what actually exists there today.
We don&#39;t know.  Its all a snap shot in time.
If our galaxy was the size of the USA then our sun would be the size of a red blood cell.
I am made uneasy by watching this discussion. There appears an increasing distance between the lofty ideals of these minds and the leaden opportunists who lead us. Just saying.
Huge money, the truth is no benefit more science fiction.
I wanted to say thank you for your presentation. You do a great job of making these topics accessible, and approachable to non-scientest. On multiple occasions I&#39;ve hurd you be self deprecating. Also on multiple occasions I&#39;ve hurd you express a sincere invitation for anyone to consider the data. You do a great job of interpolating the shop talk of academics and literally bringing it down to earth. I really think that you are opening doors to future generations of scientists by making it more accessible. Thank you, to you and everyone behind the scenes who helps you.
How is any of this supposed to help mankind?
How are you helping mankind?
What a treat!
I feel maybe our model of the universe is wrong and the big bang was a white hole, there was galaxies already forming when the repulsive force of the white hole has only just stopped 13 billion years ago and the universe is probably trillions of years old üòÇ
Awesome, just one critism. The white backgrounds on the streams are way to bright, especially on a big screen tv. Hurts my eyes to be honest and is not nice to watch
Stop sucking up on Brian .. he‚Äôs doing a great job without it
Correction; Science
Some 30 years ago when I was reading science, I read an article on the early universe, detailing how there were two models, at that time, I really Galaxy formation. One was the bottom up. Model were the first object to form with it we‚Äôre stars, and they would aggregate into clusters in the clusters would grow in the galaxies. The other, competing, model was the top down model, which Argued that early galaxies formed as one object initially, rapidly accumulating mass from the surrounding, and burns to form a galaxy sized mass, which then differentiated into stars. Considering the fact that at the time of the early universe, the universe itself was much smaller and extent, and therefore much denser, it seems logical that galaxy and star formation would proceed rapidly. The recent web findings showing massive galaxies formed early on, seems to support the top down model. What is the current consensus in this regard?
That feeling when the smartest guys on this planet tell you stories.... I love this channel.
Never ceases to amaze. Extraordinary!

It was my pleasure to be on this show with Brian Greene
Why can&#39;t you just say how good the image is? it&#39;s not been posted online yet, the majority of the earths population isn&#39;t paying attention to this type of news. They are concerned with the kardashisms or whatever they&#39;re called.
Hmm beyond Neptune?   I know it is hard to believe and you can call me crazy.   But that‚Äôs where we are going to find exotic life forms, mostly in asteroid belt , some day.  Mark my word.

JWST deep field is gonna be a BIG deal
Thanks to Brian Greene for asking critical and good questions.. This is just beautiful. BEYOND beautiful!!!.
I‚Äôm thinking that the early universe was in a much smaller space, so it makes sense to me (an absolute novice) that stars and galaxies would form and evolve much quicker.
Thanks to Brian Greene for asking critical and good questions.
Habitable zone???...it might be a joke these days Europa is not in the habitable zone as well as enceladus...and it&#39;s possible that live exist under the ice crust...
why in an expanding universe would it be unusual that the early universe be expanding slower than the later part?
They don&#39;t know... But additional funding, time and tools might uncover some new information.<br><br>Meanwhile creating a material to fill potholes that will last more than 3 months still eludes us.

What if in the same way a planetary system forms from the remains of a star, galaxies formed from the remains of super giant early stars which created the super massive black holes in the centre of galaxies? Then again for all we know we&#39;re in a black hole right now...
They are simply tryong to justify the billions they stole from you. This like the super collider results are made up bs.

&quot;its like building cathedrals&quot; i truly appreciate all involved...keep pushing us forward
Thanks Brain for such discussions. I like this discussion which I am still watching at around 33 minutes. I also had the change to watch the talk about  James WEBB few days before it was launched.<br>@just have minor question on the ring images. Do they always appear in that (not sure how to say in English ... let me us horizontal shape) horizontal like shape or is there a vertical like shape straight to our view dimensions or angle which are crossing those laying ring-shape. E.g. close shape like the way we draw our longitude and latitude lines our the equator which are imaginary while these are real objects&#39; shape appearing in such circles. I mean are they one side circles or 2 intersecting like circles?<br><br>The reason I am asking for such data is that I am thinking in space as without-directions or dimensions as a whole-as-space.
I am glad they finally got it off the ground. I&#39;d been waiting 20 years. I only wish I had another 20 in me for it.
So nobody is going to talk about his voice, okay
The assumptions of the origins of the universe are wrong but intellectual mathematical physics are developed from the observing human collective brain that has followed a path of scientific egos whose egos compartmentalize the enormous existence of our infinite reality into their devoted field of supposed objective meaning into a finite certainty contained within their mortal and infinitesimally brief existence swallowed in an eternal ocean.
The Universe has no beginning or end. Their was no Big Bang Period.

Ahhh, the James Webb Space Telescope is an AMERICAN product chump‚Ä¶ and don‚Äôt forget it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúworld product‚Äù it‚Äôs pure American ingenuity.
The JWST involved over 300 universities, companies and organizations around the world across 15 different countries. It is not an exclusively American product any more than you are an intellectual.
Do your homework!  13 other countries contributed to the design, engineering and construction of the JWST.  Not Knocking the good old USA - but please............give credit where and when it is due.
They do a good job of describing how fuzzy some of these calculations and hypothesis are....so many variables at play, and it&#39;s worth reminding ourselves we&#39;re still coming to terms with how far away Betelgeuse is with any solid accuracy, a star quite nearby.  The &quot;cold dark matter&quot; we&#39;re so excited to assume is one of the missing pieces to our observation vs. physics has never been observed, not &quot;dark&quot; as much as completely indetectable and a bookmark for future discovery along with &quot;dark energy&quot; which is just a way of saying we don&#39;t know what the force is that dictates the expansion in our observations.  Like dating human history using ancient pottery, things shift as our understanding changes.  I feel like good cosmologists and experts will constantly remind us of these fuzzy edges and unknowns.

Excellent ! A pleasure to watch, a demonstration of how entertaining Science can be presented.<br>My sincere thanks to Brian, the guests, and the whole production team.

Amazing talk! ‚Ä¢¬∞ Spoil the beans already! ¬∞‚Ä¢üòÇ Worth every minute of our time.
Brian I have been fortunate enough to watch WSF for many years now: thank you! This presentation is among the best, Im a Kiwi but Michele&#39;s passion &amp; communication is wonderful.
This was an excellent program that was both informative and excited the imagination. <br>All the guests were phenomenal; however I must say that Michelle Bannister‚Äôs enthusiasm radiates brings me a joy I rarely feel these days. She seems so delighted to be doing what she does, and is very effective at serving the viewer with digestible bits of her experiences that are still contain enough elation to be pleasantly intoxicating.
Passion!  This is the best embellishment of imaginative curiosity.
So exciting ! I won&#39;t be here for the next upgrade in 30 years but I can only imagine how wonderful it will be! Excellent conversations.  Thank You.
It is the awareness of some of the amazing things that science will be investigating,  but not for some time,  that I find to be the biggest misery that comes with being cognizant of our mortality. <br><br>There are so many fascinating discoveries that will change how we understand our universe,  and it&#39;s such a bummer to know that current advances in technology, which are already rapidly expanding our view,   guarantees there&#39;ll be so much,  that I would love to learn about,  that&#39;ll happen after I have shuffled off this mortal coil.
My feeling is black holes are just an expression of a fifth spatial dimensional direction. Traveling towards a black hole would seem like you are getting closer to it as the environment shifts around you to resemble normal universe, but it wouldn&#39;t get any closer. Just like, traveling towards SPACE from EARTH is directionally UP.<br><br>James Webb images in the early galaxy inspired this thought.<br><br>Warping of spacetime affects our observations, and we mistake that for reality. If a black hole bends spacetime towards a singularity, time also bends around it.<br><br>Black holes are likely just convex energies matching the universal concave.
Brian Greene is my superhero, my kind of celebrity! ‚ù§

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=4857">1:20:57</a> THIS lol. I&#39;m proud to be a democrat because democrats are statistically more likely to be highly educated compared to Trumpie republicans. It&#39;s not a coincidence. Democrats are more educated, we recognize science(for example on the topic of gender), &amp;we view all humans as equalü§ç
We can now know beforehand whether a possibly habitable planet has a housefly problem.
As I&#39;ve said before and will continue to say, the image at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWEYDddJ7Q&amp;t=456">7:36</a> is NOT of gravitational lensing (at least not wholly). The dead give-away (and what should be obvious to anyone who fundamentally understands gravity) is the arc signatures and the presumptive focal center of mass for each definable arc representation given the claim of gravitational lensing.<br>It wouldn&#39;t be a stretch to suggest that if there is 5 baryons per cubic yard of space in one area and 2 baryons per cubic yard of space in another area on average (for example), that these minimal quantities of actual matter could not be detected at billions of light years distance and the interface areas between these dissimilar regions could be regions where light is channeled in another direction. Thus, a type of refraction (redirection we don&#39;t yet understand, possibly electro-magnetic, static polarization, quantum drag, muon interaction, etc.?).
Some media mention there are areas of the universe we can no longer see due to the expansion of the universe having caused them to be moving away from our region of space faster than the speed of light.   Other media, as this video does, speculate about being able to observe the earliest stars in the universe. ¬†<br><br>I‚Äôve always found it difficult to reconcile those two concepts.  If we can‚Äôt see to the outer edges of the universe, how can we be sure we are estimating the age of the universe with any precision?  Maybe that‚Äôs inherent in the math somehow, but I keep hoping someone will provide a clear explanation one of these days.
We are living in an age where the Universe has not yet expanded at a rate where we are unable to make observations near the beginning of the Universe. That time will come so we are fortunate to be living in this window of time.
@@mikotagayuna8494 Miko, I appreciate you replying.  I enjoy reading about astronomy and cosmology, but I also find them to be pretty complex and math-intensive subjects once you start getting beyond the bounds of what I think is a typical layman‚Äôs understanding.<br><br>The Wikipedia entry for Observable Universe notes that the inflationary theory of Guth, et al. ‚Äúsuggest that at present the entire universe&#39;s size is at least 1.5√ó1034 light-years‚Äîat least 3√ó1023 times the radius of the observable universe‚Äù.  It‚Äôs those kind of statements that contribute to my current confusion or misunderstanding.

@@LesterWayneDobos Certainly.  But I understand it to be one of the major theories in cosmological evolution and mentioned it to clarify my initial comment regarding the &quot;observable&quot; universe.
@@kevinc1956 Cosmology crosses my mind time to time.  The early galaxies being 10x size of milky way hadn&#39;t the time to form so huge according to big bang timeframe.

I get red shift. BUT. We all now know that light can be slowed by gravity. People keep telling me the speed of light is constant. The same people that argue for dark matter. The same people that tell me gravity is constant and a weak force. Yet in recent years the theoretical black hole is now proven. The fact that gravity has a wave function is now proven. Waves have variable intensity and because they are waves, variable frequency. My point is the energetic historical galaxies would have been massively gravity intensive on a wave spectrum. We should surely not judge the age of anything based on the speed of light when we cannot measure the effects of gravity outside our frame of reference. People also tell me that Newtons laws and General relativity accurately predict the motion of large objects we observe. No they dont. Newtons laws fall down when observing anything outside our &quot;solar system&quot; frame of reference. General relativity starts to break down when observing anything that is singular, be it super massive or quanta in nature. Im not sure we can ever truly understand the age and size of our universe without knowing which gravitational wave events took place, where, when and how big!!!
It&#39;s not slowed by gravity... It is bent to follow the gravity curve which is a longer path than a direct line.
Whatever happened, the Big Bang was super powerful. It‚Äôs typing this. Crazy

I have a question for the astrophysicists. Can we detect planets orbiting a star which has the rotational axis of the system pointed directly at the Earth? If not, how much does this limited the detection of planets?
The transit method is not the only method used to detect planets. Astronomers can also look for wobbling as a result of a planet&#39;s radial velocity as well as the bending of the star&#39;s light due to effect of a planet&#39;s gravitation.
@@mikotagayuna8494 Thanks for the reply. I had heard of the wobble detection method but forgot it. Wobble detection must be very difficult due to the size of the movement. I can&#39;t imagine how much the Sun moves in response to Jupiter&#39;s orbit but to detect that wobble at a distance of lightyears is mind blowing. Cheers.
I would guess , around a million people , working together , for a common goal the JWT......what if humanity , did the same.....? .
Wise words, keep spreading.
The advances in our knowledge of the universe since JWST became functional is nothing less than mind blowing. There is life on other planets, the only unknown is how much, there is probably intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy, again the only unknown is frequency.<br>As a 67yo one minor regret is that I may not live long enough to know for sure that life has been discovered on other planets or that intelligent life has been discovered elsewhere.
My guess is that we&#39;ll have a colony on Mars sooner than the life question is definitively answered...if it ever is.<br>I&#39;m in the same boat as you, only a few years further along life&#39;s journey.  At least we have eclipsed the entire history of humans in space to this point.
According to many NDE&#39;s I&#39;ve heard, it may be that we will know all after life here. If we live to see life found on other planets, that will be awesome, but if we then die and no longer exist and our awareness is gone, what&#39;s the point in knowing anything anyway? It&#39;s only a moment in time, a blip in eternity, and seems meaningless in the bigger picture if we don&#39;t carry our awareness beyond our physical life. Knowledge, memories, insight...none of it matters if it is extinguished after a physical lifetime. It would be pretty worthless. I guess it can be passed to living humans to advance things but eventually our sun will destroy our planet, the universe will expand, it will likely die and there will be no trace of our physical life, and no evidence we even existed.
‚Äã@@mygirldarby You&#39;re right. I have thought about this exact point. What&#39;s the point of knowing anything anyway? I don&#39;t know of any way of determining the answer to this for sure. But just because we can imagine the question, ie why are we conscious, is not an argument in support of the convenient answer, which is, yes because we are conscious our life must have meaning. The alternative answer is just as likely. It&#39;s 7AM and 15 deg C, what a bloody awful time to consider the question.
‚Äã‚Äã@@mayflowerlash11ifficult to determine what your actually pondering, but if you think life has meaning other than what you imbue it with, then I guess you&#39;re still very young; meaning is a philosophical question, not a scientific one; the inability to cope with my answer is the crutch called religion.<br><br>Consciousness allows you to ask that question, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a useful question, except perhaps at parties to get chats going with ppl you want to hook up with.
Curious to know if anyone here KNOWS that there&#39;s life on other planets, in or out of our solar system.  Please tell me that you&#39;re not waiting for disclosure from government
Having Brian Greene ask questions that we are not allowed to ask, seems politically biased.

Right?! Have you seen HiRise stereo imagery yet? (In vr)
Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis<br> <br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of mass?  Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the ‚Äúfabric‚Äù of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point?<br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn‚Äôt expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn‚Äôt require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it‚Ä¶
Good point üëâ
I don&#39;t believe in your imprint theory.  It&#39;s not as simple as a piece of metal bent and left that way.
Excellent! I can&#39;t wait to see the new discoveries.
As great as JWST is, it&#39;s not really an investment for humanity&#39;s survival.  <br>Pretty sad really.  Who&#39;s working on a NOBEL prize for ending war, or homelessness, or disease.  Seriously.
Incroyable
Brian, they will find within the next 24 months that there is no expanding universe. We may also learn that galaxies farthest away from us are actually smaller not larger. We will learn that the mass of &quot;things&quot; closer to us are larger than the mass farther away. This is why we THINK far-away galaxies that appear larger because we are comparing the mass of close items to have the same mass as the same items farther away. Items farther away are actually &quot;compressed&quot; the farther away it is. Imagine a fish that lives its entire life at the bottom of a deep ocean. There it is in equilibrium. A fisherman hooks one of them and pulls it to the surface where it bloats and eyes pop out of its head. It was compressed and then depressurized. This is the far universe.

I have a question, what if the universe was created simultaneously and set into motion. If this is the case then when we look at other galaxies from great distance&#39;s could it be that we are not looking back to the beginning but rather at a gallexy that is just so far away that it&#39;s light has red shifted simply because of it&#39;s distance. This would imply that the universe does not have an age at least one that we can comprehen as we cannot gauge it&#39;s size, depth, width, or understand all of it&#39;s intricate parts. This view has validity and reliability that perhaps could serve the scientific method of observation.

The passage of time is entirely derived from the movement of energy. Eliminate energy and there is no time. As the rate of the movement of energy is limited to the speed of light, the passage of time is metered by the speed of light, at least in the open Universe. The fact that humans were not around in the early universe, this does not mean that there was no time. The passage of energy through an unconscious universe was vital to the development of the kind of Universe that could support life and humans. The early Universe was busily making the heavy elements and dispersing them around space as dust clouds and chunks of minerals metals and water to make our world possible right here where we live,‚Ä¶.now. I love the biological expression ‚Äúwhat doesn‚Äôt kill you, will evolve and try again‚Äù, and this likely means that it won‚Äôt be an expanding sun that ends our time, it will be life itself. <br>This should help you see that there is no time travel. What is real is the now. We can predict certain aspects of the future and prepare for them mostly where the events prepared for are operating at sub light speed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2400">40:00</a> but where does this need for trascendence comes from? if we are just particles of the universe, and the universe has no need for stories or trascendence, where does this need comes from? that seems to point in direction to something beyond physics (physics as we currently know)
My comment below was for a previous video on &quot;science&quot;, and not this one, but anyone doubting that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza is either brain dead or dumb and blind.     Many thanks to SA.
Pardon the interruption of your narcissistic orgy, but the earth becomes Venus 2.0 in 115 yrs., if the European Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) is correct with their prediction that all of the planet&#39;s heat absorbing global ice will be gone by 2,138, or 115 yrs. from now, although it would appear that climate apocalypse may overtake us sooner than later.   All the rest is just BS and mental masturbation by narcissists.
If is all the motions of particles  causes consciousness why you smart people ones can not make any objects smart???
Our future relies on humans uniting instinctively!  Music, our international language, can Be intimately uniting!  Groovists believe we all now, can participate in our evolution!  As our reason for Being One of ten billion, we all must Groove as One!!!
Look, all we are is particles. What‚Äôs all this nonsense?

Great conversation...I really enjoyed it! I see that book is on Audible and it gets good reviews.
Simply listening to this makes my life more meaningful
Free will.... Is like how the ego can convince itself that it is the agent that is intentionally doing the breathing in and out when it&#39;s actually the autonomic nervous system. The ego thinks it&#39;s running 100 % of the show when really it&#39;s only running about 10% but the subconscious is doing most everything.
experience is waaaay more than words, i can describe fireworks to you but I can never make you feel the beauty of being at a fireworks show. i personally think that the brain reacts to so many different stimuli, some as random and absurd as the universe itself, that our &quot;free will&quot; and our sense of self has fundamentally infinite possibilities. it&#39;s crazy how much we can really think about if we band together
This is a good interview, not only Brian is brilant, but Faith salie is very well prepared,
It is accurate to assert that complex systems, such as weather patterns and human behavior, are not deterministic. This is due to the intricate interplay of numerous processes, even though these do not necessarily involve true free will. Particularly in highly intelligent beings, like humans or potentially future AI (should development continue), there is a manifestation of behavior that closely resembles free will. Delving deeper into this argument, one might question whether highly free-will-like behavior is equivalent to true free will. In my opinion, it is not. However, what is certain is that such behavior is decidedly non-deterministic. This represents a partial triumph over the concept of determinism.

Our fragile and fleeting existence bears the imprint of the extraordinary‚Äîa rarity that provides meaning to the fragility of life.

@user-kw8zj9zm5g<br>7 minutes ago (edited)<br>@user-kw8zjizm5g<br>from Byron vyron as victor victor<br>Its time to let my truth out and proof with evidence science proof soon, and that there is something else with us on planet earth, and it has family and friends around the globe and its the singularity of the universe life structure and its conscious and alive and I call it God, Light philosophy the very thing that made life on earth, and yes its the truth to settle your minds forever eternal in unity but it also favours the 2 sides of life and special life ethos
Dr. Greene, many thanks for your efforts! If I may ask a question...<br>In  Phys. Rev. 160, 1113 (1967) Bryce DeWitt, as well as John A.Wheeler in &quot;Relativity, Groups and Topology&quot; (1968) - they have developed the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a wave function of the Universe. Above all, they came to a conclusion that (in the case of so called &#39;mini-superspace&#39;) the wave function (a.k.a. amplitude of probability) does not depend on time. Well, but this conclusion is in conflict with our &#39;daily&#39; experience that universe in fact is changing with time. Thus, it follows that Universe (including US in it) does not change, and time does not exist, while We, the Observer, experience time within it and do observe the change... <br>Probably as laity in theoretical physics I am mistaken with this interpretation, but could you please give your interpretation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for wave function of the Universe. Thank you
Entropy is the measure of disorder and it always increases ... then why and how there was the &quot;order&quot; before ?
History tell&#39;s us we have had a polor shift. Did a compos point south or is the magnetic field always point to the north
This video is equal parts informative and beautiful, and I think that&#39;s largely a reflection of the 2 humans sharing the stage. Faith and Brian seem to complement each other perfectly... literally and figuratively. My only complaint is this: TOO SHORT. I would happily spend several more hours with these people. Just wonderful.

This is so awesome.  Here is a very intelligent guest having a civil discussion with a very intelligent interviewer. She asks a (that is just one) coherent question then stops talking and lets him answer. She listens patiently then when he is done speaking asks another question.  This is so sadly unusual these days.
It&#39;s that place beyond numbers...it becomes theory and not 3d anymore....
Eventually all math turns into theory and explores the undescribable....
According to Mario Livio we can predict the age of the Universe much more accuratelty than the age of a Human.
I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD QUESTIONS THE SAME WAY AS BRIAN HAS,WHY ARE WE HERE?,THE EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF LOVE,FEEL,HATE,COMUNICATE EACH OTHER,ETC,AND WHY ARE WE COSNCIOUS BEINGS? ETC ETC;AND I WAS ASKING THE WRONG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR  ANSWERS WERE SOMETHING LIKE:DON&#39;T ASK DUMB QUESTIONS OR HOW SILLY ARE YOU ASKING THOSE THINGS,AND FINALLY I&#39;VE FOUND PEOPLE LIKE BRIAN GREENE,ELON MUSK,LEX FRIDMAN,ETC,PEOPLE WHO HAS THE SAME QUESTIONS AS ME AND BESIDES SUPER SMART PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS,THIS IS &quot;AMAZING&quot;!!üëçüëçüëçüëç
It is so naive to state that there is no meaning in the universe while at the same time stating that it&#39;s just particles obeying the LAW! It seems that we are too anthropic to prove god or teleology doesn&#39;t exist, as we are too anthropic to prove it does.

He&#39;s wrong about free will. He doesn&#39;t account for our Devine spirit, which is not just particle motion.
If randomness exist, just like quantum mechanics predicts, and our consciosness is governed by the quantum theory then there must be some destiny thats beyond our mathematical models and that destiny is our free will; free of every previous knowlege.
She&#39;s a really terrific interviewer. She clearly read the book, has cogent questions, and articulates them well.
I have just started listening to the audio version of his book, narrated by Brian Greene himself. What a wonderful, thought provoking journey it is proving to be. I respect this man for his intelligence, dedication, and his storytelling abilities to make the mind staggering information of quantum physics understandable to one (me) who has no scientific background but does have a curiosity. Thank you, Dr. Greene. And Thank you, Faith Sallie for this program.
wow!!!
Time is a measuring device, just like a tap measurer measures the length of a board. Time is used to measure life and existence. time is just a form of explaining how things come and go.
I feel similar to the way Brian did about doing physics going through some dark moments or a tough portion of life. Thank You Dr. Greene, you will always be a motivation for me in life.

I have a question for Mr. Greene.  Does the universe knows it exists.
We are already aware of this information. It has been reiterated hundreds of times. Unless there are new scientific breakthroughs, no one will pay attention to these repetitions in the near future.
Excellent. One of the best conversations about physics and meaning I have watched
Well said Brian Greene.
It&#39;d be happier if the interviewer gave more appreciations to Brian&#39;s brilliant self-reflections instead of talking about her kid stories multiple times.
I&#39;ll never get over what an amazing speaker he is on subjects thats borderline impossible to comprehend for a lot of people

The interviewer, Faith Salie, is such a Manhattanite. Good fun, folks!
<i>&quot;Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity helped us to understand gravity&quot;</i> OH really then what about Karl Swarzschild&#39;s answer to Einstein in 1917?<br><br>BIG BANG Gravity Problem:<br>1.	Big Bang assumes energy and matter from nothing in a quantum singularity or fluctuation<br>2.	The density is quoted variously as extreme to infinite<br>3.	The total mass of the universe curves space and shapes the universes destiny<br>4.	Black Holes have an escape velocity at their event horizon equal to the speed of light<br>5.	The size of a Black Hole is measured by its mass which gives the diameter of the event horizon<br>6.	The mass of the universe is ~1e80 protons = 6.7e53 Kg<br>7.	The formula for escape velocity = (2GM/r)^0.5 Therefore r = 2GM/v^2<br>8.	Given M = 6.7e53 Kg and v = 3e8 m/sec therefore Dia = 2.r = 52.5 billion light yrs<br>9.	The universe cannot at any time have been smaller than 52.5 billion light yrs in diameter<br>10.	This is called the Schwarzschild&#39;s Radius of any mass and is well known<br>11.	Hence the matter in the universe can only have been created <b>after the expansion of space..</b><br><b>The Big Bang is falsified as a violation of the law of gravity! Q.E.D.</b><br><br>This is uniquely consistent with the Genesis account of creation of stars on day 4 after the expansion of space. Also <i>&quot;Let there be light.&quot;</i> on day 1 explains the uniform CMBR being a burst of photon energy with no mass.
If as he says <i>&quot;the truths of math will never change&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;once you prove a theorem in mathematics it stands forever&quot;</i> we know we did not invent it we only discovered it. Someone else <i>&quot;invented&quot;</i> it actually!
<b>Maths</b> <i>&quot;something we invent don&#39;t discover&quot;</i> If mathematics did not have rules that would sound ok. But the fact math has very specific rules tells us; <b>NO</b> we did not <b>invent</b> it we discovered it. It is one of the things that makes the universe understandable and one of the reasons we were designed to be able to understand it and give proper recognition to God who both designed and created it.
She is wearing a tablecloth, lol
I think this lady is a nut job.  Could she push his book any more than she did. OMG ....how nauseous.<br>And this guy is nothing more than a philosophical mathematician.
Such an intelligent man ,yet so wrong in the Free Will part. No, Vitalism has not been debunked by explaining away life ( which hasn&#39;t  happened anyway).There are mountains of evidence that science can&#39;t explain and ,in its modern reductionist version, never will.
Why is she screaming?
Watching this guy , my brain struggles to keep up. Is it better to live life in ignorance of the greater things we cannot control or just let these guys get on with it? How does he sleep at night with all these questions. ‚ù§
Every one here for brian wile i am here wishing i was faiths chair.
its still an unexplained gap - the experience of qualia is not evident in physics so perhaps a meta law is needed
About a year ago, I bought a bookshelf for my living room that really tied the room together. I had 5 shelves, and I filled one with my fiction books, and the bottom with my college books. I just ordered Brian&#39;s book here and am about to clear the random stuff I have on another shelf, and start my new nonfiction section. It will be here wednesday. I gotta read it first so that section will wait.
I love this man&#39;s knowledge when I realized that the Planet Earth does not need our presence at any level
great to have people like him!
10 second : the entire year = 1: 3,153,600. This is the difference between $1 and $3,153,600. A huge difference but I can comprehend and I can set plan to earn that amount in my lifetime. The entire history of universe is human comprehensible.

Random blobs of molecules trying to articulate the meaning of all this randomness.
Are higher dimensions earlier in origination than lower ones? If so I could imagine that since the earth kind of seems more roundy than the flatyness of the universe that maybe the earth type of time is different dimensionally than the universal type of time.
Amazing interview!! Best in absolute!

The Universe sounds so cool!  I must visit it come day.
I am perplexed, and indeed frustrated, that so many scientists choose to disregard Roger Penrose&#39;s rigorous demonstration that &quot;understanding&quot; must be non-algorithmic in character. Even if we speculate, with Brian Greene, that consciousness refers to             &quot;nothing but&quot; the working of some notionally complex procedure or system, then Penrose has shown that this supposition is by no means justified. (ie in terms of the procedure itself). It also follows that we may have genuine free-will, somehow associated with the workings of the brain, even though this principle is not understandable either as a deterministic or as a random process.
Euclid wrote the first scientific treatise on vision. In his <i>Optika,</i> we already find a decided emphasis on the traditional geometric aspects of the subject. Euclid contributed to our story in another important way. The seeming certainty and clarity of his <i>Elements</i> inspired Galileo, Newton, and Descartes in their drive toward a mathematical account of nature. Akin to the Greeks, they also sought to anchor their work in certainty. Now, unlike color and sound, the spatial and temporal dimensions of experience were seen to have an agreeable constancy or invariance to them ‚Äî and then, we have long had measuring sticks and clocks to measure space and time, so that helped them along immeasurably.<br><br>Today, we have accurate ways of measuring color and sound, but as yet no very good geometrical understanding of these facets of nature. We do know, however, that the spatial and temporal dimensions of things change with relative motion ‚Äî as do color and sound when they Doppler in or out, shifting toward the red or blue, depending.<br><br>We also know that colors and sounds are <i>invariant</i> or <i>symmetric</i> when under the same conditions, allowing us to engineer color TVs, computer monitors, as well as all the gadgets we have nowadays for reproducing sound. And then, as we shall see, we now know that symmetry governs everything going on in the universe, which is kind of interesting.<br><br>A second important thread can be traced back to antiquity. Greek atomism gave rise to the persistent notion that colors and sounds exist only in the mind, or as matters of opinion ‚Äî a dogma which continues to dominate scientific thinking today. Again, many intelligent people, Nobel laureates among them, will hasten to tell you that color is just the frequency of light. This nonsense gets repeated so often, it is of a piece with what ‚Äúeveryone knows.‚Äù (Try to discover who figured this out, however, and when, and where, and how that is supposed to make any sense, and good luck to you.) <br><br>The truth is that color has never been successfully incorporated into the body of science. Yet we routinely read in textbooks on quantum theory that the wave function contains, in principle, all that we can know about a physical thing. The author of the wave function clearly disagreed, however. <br><br>When not dabbling in quantum theory, Schr√∂dinger thought a lot about color:<br><br> &quot;If you ask a physicist what is his idea of yellow light, he will tell you that it is transversal electromagnetic waves of wavelength in the neighborhood of 590 millimicrons. If you ask him: But where does yellow come in? he will say: In my picture not at all, but these kinds of vibrations, when they hit the retina of a healthy eye, give the person whose eye it is the sensation of yellow.&quot;<br><br>So we have color and sound and the other &#39;secondary qualities&#39; of Locke. We experience them all the time, in predictable, quantifiable correlations with &quot;physical&quot; things. Where in the formulations of physics might we fit these additional elements of reality?
WOW Fantastic Video!!! Thank you Brian Greene and Faith for your fabulous interaction.
Definitely science is another religion but a very simplistic and dehumanized one...
My brain completely changed when i read michio kakus hyperspace book (made before i was born, 1990, yet people dont even understand any of einstines idias yet hahaha)<br>He doesn&#39;t even say the word dimension. I do and everone gets confused and i go down rabbit holes. It&#39;s really tough talking about science because I&#39;m so far ahead of everyone else. And all a them, he and michio kaku, me, everyone. But again, they never go down the rabbit hole, even though that&#39;s the monster not only in the closet, but also under the bed and all darkness out side in night, even when you turn the lights off. You have to address it. This dark matter is string theory. Its time and space, and we even have some math equations and laws, yet they are never talked about. There&#39;s so much, ... and he even kinda leans tord without a question, and answer is worthless. If you skip to the end of our book, everybody dies. Boaring.<br>The only religion worth teaching is string theory because particals are transdimensional.<br><br>But he says all there is is laws of physics and particals wiggling till they die. Yea being one with nature is cool, but if you cant get into that, get into what i say, be one with dimensions. Be one with string theory. They will all pass on. What makes our molecules are tied to us transdimensionaly, and then they all go away when time doesn&#39;t matter anymore. They go up a dimension. Time is a dimension.<br>Its more than just death, and its not religion. I believe in super string theory. Its been around for almost twice I&#39;ve been alive for. One day more people will be like me. I&#39;ve lived a tough life and nobody knows or cares, but i believe in something better than anybody else. In other words, get on my level bro.<br>Theres more forces of nature in lower dimensions. The more forces of nature are combined with gravity in higher dimensions. He even wrote that in his book, but again, thats not &quot;in sceen&quot; its not what the cool cats do. Therefore all u can do is buy his book and monitize knolage.

she interjects far too much
Growing up, I Never had somebody to look up to but Brian Green has become one of very few select that I do listen to and appreciate. I was lucky enough to ask him a question in Sydney two months back and it was an honour to do so. Thank you for keeping me interested in science and space. Your influence has made its way to the philosophy that I have been adopting while doing my PhD
Free will is not illusory.
How ludicrous, thought will come to an end? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Entropy is relative.
Time exists because matter exists. But God is not matter,  God created matter. Time began when God created the universe. Before that God was simply existing. Since there was no matter, and because God does not change,  time had no existence and therefore no meaning, no relation to him.   Even now time has no relation to God, he is outside of time, even though time and matter exist.
The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by hands. And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives men life and breath and everything else.
He is a worthy successor of dr. Carl Sagan.
Brian Greene is my source for time space and what not!   You keep me coming back to you dear Sir!  Thank you!
This interviewer is unbearable
The battle/coexistence between entropy and evolution sounds a lot like the coexistence of dark energy and gravity.

OK, I understood the sun to blame for thermonuclear destruction and we have no news about the war in Ukraine
I love science but the more I learn about the universe the more my faith is reinforced in the teachings of the Bhagaved gita. No religious scripture goes into the science of the universe like the Bhagaved gita. And the mathematical calculation for the age of the universe was first written thousands of years ago in the Bhagaved gita. Even Carl Sagan admitted that.
Yes, Very Thought Provoking.
His brother.....consiousness is fundamental reality.....In hinduism consiousness is everything......but according to him physics is everything.... And Iam really confused about everything
Respect your own Intuition.
Brian Greene is just SO ERUDITE !
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
i wanna r-produc- with that prtty body!
So is nobody going to mention the actual demon lady?
I can listen to Brian Greene talk all day, this man has so many brilliant ideas and his perspective is unique and I can&#39;t do nothing but have the upmost respect for that man
It&#39;s so nice to see Brian interviewed for a change.
They have nothing new to say...
Could we perhaps think that space has always been here.   Now perhaps this takes place all over the known and the unknown millions of megaparsects could this happen all over space
I do absolutely enjoy all of your  shows and lectures thank you for reigning my interest in  physics and just waking up the part of me that made want to learn.
Love Brian Green, his passion and enthusiasm is contagious
Fascinating
amazing guy......
Wonderful episode!  Faith - energetic, smart and beautiful and a great interviewer! Same with Brian! :) <br>Love from sweden!
Wow, the butt-kissing comments are especially thick here.
You could argue that there is something rather than nothing because there is no evidence for nothingness other than the concept/notion of &quot;nothing&quot;, constructed by our brain. The vacuum of space isn&#39;t empty. Even &quot;Zero&quot; represents the depletion of a measured quantity rather than nothingness. Once we can prove that nothingness exists, we can argue for it,.
Nice boots man.
A collection of particles does not do &quot;it&quot;, they do not emerge consciousness (imho). Why does the majority of this era just buy that story without doubt, like a religion, without noticing?<br>Matter seems not fundamental - or e.g. why &gt;90% dark &quot;matter&quot;, hahaha?

I wholeheartedly nominate Brian Greens as a deserving candidate for the Nobel Prize in recognition of his remarkable contributions to enhancing public understanding of the universe&#39;s profound realities. Throughout his illustrious career, Greens has demonstrated an extraordinary ability to communicate complex scientific concepts with unparalleled clarity and enthusiasm, making him an exceptional advocate for science and a driving force behind public engagement.<br><br>Brian Greens&#39; dedication to science communication has been nothing short of inspiring.

Oh guys, thank you! I enjoyed every moment of it!
When they mention the table, they are wrong. The table is made of atoms. Everything in the universe is made of atoms atoms is consciousness, so that table is conscious because it‚Äôs made of atoms.
Faith Salie was excellent. I confess I didn‚Äôt know who she was. Among other things (funny and engaging) . . . Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Magna.
Consciousness = not motions of particles, but motion of information carried by particles (or even without). This causes the emergence of complex meta-information?!
Thanks again.
Why is the universe not nothing? There is only one nothing, but there are an infinite number of ways something can exist. Therefore nothing is impossible. So the universe must exist.
Basic element of Time IS change.
I have questions : What is a dimension actually?  and another<br>what is the disturbance that vibrates the string in string theory?
It continues to bug me that Humans define entropy as having to do with disorder. Isn&#39;t disorder only a concern to us, or to the living, not to nature? Same thing with time&#39;s arrow, often described as being always forwards because we can&#39;t piece together a broken vase. But repairing so-called broken things is only a concern to the living. &#39;Degrading&#39; into &#39;disorder&#39; always seemed value-laden language. I always suppose these values are not shared by the cosmos &amp; that disrupts my understanding of entropy.
I don&#39; t see a contradiction between everything that Doctor Greene thinks, and explains so wonderfully, and the idea of an Entity  that might have created  these physical laws and the various particles ...I mean, the whole stunning immensity that surrounds us actually seems to REQUIRE it....
Free will = self determination and self ordering

Well Brian, there is a simple problem with this discussion of free will, we have no common and well defined definition of free will and that goes whether you are for or against the notion.

Damn, you guys are so bitter lol. I really enjoyed this conversation which took place between these two people so I acknowledged them both. Going out of your way to insult her says more about you than her

Agreed!

She‚Äôs not letting you hit brother üôè
‚Äã@@greenteapeng_  I share your opinion of Faith as quite wonderful, but I&#39;m curious about your offense at the other opinions: &quot;very average&quot; and &quot;represented the everyday person&quot;.  Why are those insults?  Do you believe the average person/host (i.e.: with statistically common attributes) is inferior to others?  If someone did find her to be average as a person and/or host, is there a way of expressing that which you would find non-insulting?  Or is the thought itself definitively, irrevocably insulting and its expression in any form disparaging?  Either or both of the other commenters might have simply been expressing neutral observations of their perception of her as similar to other people/hosts without judgment, ideas of inferiority/superiority, while still thinking she&#39;s lovely (average people can be lovely, too)...  And if so, then reading insult into their words would say more about your own biases -- <i>your</i> negative perception of averageness -- than anything about the other commenters.
You have a very average opinion ‚Äã@@dismalthoughts
I can&#39;t listen to her shouting

Good interview.
Would have loved to see Eric Weinstein sit in as a second sounding board (or moderator), even though that would probably be the last thing Brian might suggest for a more balanced discussion (leaving out the &quot;compost&quot; if you will).
Dear Professor so good to have you! my question what if you are wrong? any other ideas than it is cold cold cold like Dante&#39;s inferno @Smolin physics != mathematics ? Can you please both write some &quot;war time&quot; book together ?
After what Brian Greene said about The Freewill and the illusion of it:<br>I have questioned myself, my life and it&#39;s meaning, and the meaning of the whole universe?<br><br>But I still believing in Freewill, and I think that the double slit experiment and observer effect may be a reflection of our Freewill.
There is a generous amount of semantics at work in such arguments.
The only validity to such arguments is that there is a less than infinite amount of choices you can make in any situation, therefore your choices are already made.

Great guest. She did her homework.
These topics and exploration of the universe bring me a joy that nothing else can. I only wish I had friends who enjoy the same intellectual debates as I do so we can share our rambles and thoughts as we talk through the night.
Who cares how long humanity lasts?  It makes no difference.  The human race is so ego maniacal, when in fact our entire existence most likely means exactly nothing.   And no, it doesn&#39;t matter if we are the only &#39;intelligent&#39; beings in the universe, or ever have been, or not.
Mr Greene is amazing.  Very smart and yet very humble.  Totally unassuming individual.  Respect!
So, when does a cup of cofee rise without free will???? The answer is NEVER.
Beautifully done. It&#39;s not about legacy. It&#39;s about this magic moment we live in now. We all have won the cosmos of lotteries! This tiny moment IS enough. I&#39;m 74 and have had a lifetime of adventure on. land and sea. I&#39;m headed to the Alaskan Wilderness in August. Live to you die. Live life to its top. And please let me say this magic is where you are right now. You don&#39;t have to Sail to the Bahamas or live in the Alaskan wilderness. You are truely free to live now. Don&#39;t waste a breath. Change your self-story if you have to. Now go live. Throw my ashes into the Bering Sea right after my last gasp.
The interviewer had to much &#39;fan girl&#39; vibe going.   Her constant adulation to Brian was not very illuminating.  I am always irked when interviewers talk about how they cannot begin to comprehend the genius of those they are interviewing.

We want to get to the bottom of things. Science is the latest and best choice we have right now. Good philosophy can do it too. We are driven to get to the final whyy and how. Why do we do that?
Ego
@@debbino4249 Curiosity would be my first choice. But what do I know? I&#39;m not above it, I&#39;m in it.
Transcendence? Did Brian Green just agree to transcendence?
Many anthropologists and archaeologists agree that painting, singing, and drumming came before language. Maybe one hundred thousand years ago. Think Lalala ooooo. Lullabyes.<br>Also flutes made of tree branches...etc. art before language.
Excellent interview. I always learn new stuff from hearing Brian. He is a fantastic educator. Tremendous Faith and Brian for good 60 minutes.
Would anyone like to read about life having no meaning? Read Albert Camus. Mid twentieth century philosopher. The idea of no meaning is not new. He won the Nobel  Prize in literature.
If Brian is right about consciousness, there is no SELF. THERE IS NO I. Welcome to Buddhism and Hinduism.
My brain chemistry can allow me to make choices about how I want to do to change my brain chemistry. Part of what my brain chemistry can do is allow me to make choices between, let&#39;s say, a little bit of fun or a lot of fun. Both activities will increase my endorphins. But one will do it a better, so I choose that one.
Culture is susceptible to a type of evolution and entropy. When cultures start disintegrating/declining because of high social entropy, trouble will follow. We are at a point where our ability to destroy life on Earth is real. Cultural entropy is a major threat to all life on the planet.

You are expressing a belief. A belief is not a fact, no matter how fervent you believe.
What he doesn&#39;t seem to speak to is that 99% of all mutations are not favorable to a species and are completely unpredictable. Mutations occur randomly, and we have no idea whether they are going to be favorable or unfavorable to the existence of any given life form. Mutations are utterly random. See chaos theory.
If Jordan Peterson were a physicist... Speaking the Truth at every moment, with grace and respect.

Lest we forget, Newton thought science wouldn&#39;t exist by around 2060.
If everything is so ambiguous - consciousness. Imagine it being so debatable... Think about science itself, right?
I was going to say WTH, but I looked it up and you are correct.  Obviously Newton was a moron when it came to prediction, but then he was talking about Jerusalem etc above the date statement, so it&#39;s not surprising he went totally off into the weeds.
@@MrJdsenior He was a very intelligent man. He tried to decode the Bible as well.
We are so incredibly fortunate these days, to be able to listen to some of the brightest. Most enlightened scientific minds brought to us on YouTube . People like Brian and Sean, Carrol, and Richard Dawkins, in so many more. This kind of information was not really available before the Internet insights like YouTube. I really enjoy this kind of program.
Great interview.  Hope she isn&#39;t married.
Why?
She literally said she wished she was still dating. Came off a little thirsty.
Excellent and correct evaluation of the universe and reality. Just 3 aspects seem not clair:<br>1. Entropy: if a star is order and the surroundings disorder - that&#39;s 99% and 1% respectively and not the opposite.<br>2. in the far future how could the thermal leak of a thought be in the brick of causing disruption if by then the universe would be extremely cold and dark.<br>3. Free will: all human actions are expressed and enabled in reality by the the fundamental particles behaving as they&#39;re supposed to according to the quantum physics laws. They enable the process of action but are they the Responsible for the decision of raising the cup 0, 1, 2, .... times?

i live in nyc i walk through central park i have a daughter....god, how self centred and vain and off the point she is....
Top top top content!
Expanding left to right, north to south, what? Does the universe grow away from us, the Earth? The Earth is in the center, if so how centered? Our Sun?   I dont understand when we say the Universe is expanding... From what and where?  And what is it expanding into, how can something grow if it has no room to grow into or whatever?  I also don&#39;t know why the Term B. B. Needs to be so special to understand when we have our Bibles?  God says go and it doesn&#39;t matter how. I mean I&#39;m happy for us sure but we have much more to work on....   How do we know this is not first a concious experience?  All born by memory and mind power.  Nothing is we just think it is....and so what is relative?  Your mind will always be just as vast as this Universe. So what now?   Free Will, What about belief?   Is nothing more or less than what one believes?  Do you believe in free will?  And this is a letter, not a science show.  Yes you can think about free will in all the ways possible.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2980">49:40</a> that is why most find relief from: the majesty of existence, the shocking implications of the mundane, and the incomparable unlikelihood of the real -- in beliefs that muddy up the whole proposition and provide longed for reversion  to automatic functioning of the associative thought-centric and quite free-will devoid &quot;mind&quot;.  If the need to entertain any story, no matter how lame, becomes feverish, we could be in a good spot, we could be in a bad spot, dependent on the pointedness of our point of view. If things get too clear we can always turn on the TV, or read a metaphysical tome, or watch a YouTube video that stimulates associations we enjoy, or worst yet most soothing of all, simply reminisce with limbic seasonings.  Keeps things in homeostatic balance: that being the glacial progress, with the emphasis on stasis, that evolution favors so much on the collective level -- not that it will do us any personal good outside of antibiotics and such.

articulate , yes! true, maybe, I seriously doubt. He makes HIS points very convincing
This is odd having her interview someone like Brian. His intelligence is vastly beyond this interview level of simplicity. Its like he is explaining QM to a 8 year old child.
I don&#39;t see it that way
Aka most people
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=2400">40:00</a> Some of those stories are failed explanations of the physical reality of the ignition of dormant possibilities within the nervous and limbic systems, as opposed to the versa visa.  All concepts about such, are misconceptions, and can be nothing else.  Or to put it simply: just because you are not talking or thinking does not mean you are awake, but if your are talking or thinking, it does mean that you aren&#39;t.  At least while you are thinking or talking.
Excellent
Free will? . . . humph!  Wait until a quantum computer tells you what your next thought will be.  Then talk to me about free will.
Their are conscious organisms, such as lizards and birds (while they are not sleeping at least), and their are self-conscious organisms (like some humans, who at times are aware that they are conscious, like now, now that I brought it up)  but there is no &quot;consciousness&quot; outside of the act of being conscious, anymore than their is a &quot;runningness&quot; while sitting and reading.  Another example of misunderstanding arising from the same old propensity.  And the propensity is found in the amazingly creative ability for the  associative thought-centric mind to create conceptual models that do not correspond to reality.  Therefore providing civilization, culture, and technology to all the little particleules like youses and meses.  If you like: associate concepts about it -- but you can&#39;t get here from there.  Even if for some reason you suspect that you want to, which you won&#39;t.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=1710">28:30</a> . . . <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlyYipjw560&amp;t=1776">29:36</a>  -- Because there is no nothing.  Nothing is only a concept, and a foggy one at that.  And we all know that fog does not qualify as nothing.  I think P. Crunk said something like that.
Tell me, &quot;When is now?&quot; and I&#39;ll tell you &quot;What now is.&quot;  There is no time exclusive of space, nor space divorced from time, except in the reification of an abstraction so common it goes unnoticed.  No big deal? . . . I know.
No matter which tags u inherited by birth ( race, religion, country ) its Impossible not to have respect and love for people like Brian Greene, Jeff Hinton, Elon Musk..
The way he talks about Entropy and Order is whack as shit. He is just dumb as shit. I wonder who hes benefiting from all of this. I was once dumb like you people here who thinks he is smart(back in 2020) but really he isnt. Order and disorder are BOTH the essence of existence and not one is over the other, but he says it as if Entropy is dominant and proceeds to give a shitty and childish example like the formation of a star is on itself &quot;bad&quot; since it gives up heats üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

1 + 1 = 2 IS NOT A GENERAL TRUTH.<br>‚Äî---------------------------------------------------<br><br>If one ponders whether there exists any system of knowledge no scientist, philosopher, saint or whoever has ever disputed, then what comes immediately to anybody&#39;s mind is the system of arithmetic operations. <br><br>1 + 1 = 2 is often quoted as the best example of an undeniable absolute truth. <br><br>But are these operational rules so certain?<br> <br>Consider the following observations: <br><br>Imagine you add one heap (=lot) of apples to another heap of apples. Then you must write<br><br>1 heap + 1 heap = 1 heap<br><br>In this case it is very right to say <br><br>1+ 1 = 1<br><br>Therefore the statement that &quot;one plus one equals two&quot; is only a conditional fact and not an absolute truth.<br><br>Similarly also other rules of arithmetic. <br><br>For example if you take two heaps of apples with two in each and two with three in each and make five heaps with two in each, then the statement <br><br>2 heaps + 2 heaps = 5 heaps, <br><br>hence  2 + 2 = 5   is also correct.<br><br>  Have you ever seen even a single table of arithmetic operations, where it is mentioned that accuracy of these operations are conditional? <br><br> On the contrary,  the rules of arithmetic are often quoted as examples of &quot;absolute truth&quot; even by most stubborn philosophers. <br><br>It is taught that different catogeries (or units) cannot be added (operated, in general), but here it is the same catogery (units) ~  &quot;heaps&quot; of the very same fruit,  normally used to explain (prove) &quot;one plus one equals two&quot; ~ alone is involved.<br><br>And when you add two cubes of sugar into your tea <br><br>1 +1 = 0 is also correct.

Things go from &quot;order&quot; to disorder. Great. Where does &quot;order&quot; come from then? Physics is a religion at this point
Brian Greene is trying to save his career after hawking string theory for several decades. But, sure, big news is coming real soon. Right?

Unless the evolutionary process ends with humans, which seems to be unlikely. It would seem we are destined to evolve into another species. Then, the battle we living beings have with entropy will eventually be won or loss by whatever beings we evolve into. Humans it would seem will cease to exist because hopefully they will evolve into a more advanced species.
Such brilliance and clarity. One only hopes and dreams, provided we‚Äôre successful and don‚Äôt disperse into an endless array of particles, where no 2 shall ever meet again, that when this all returns from wince time, space and everything came, that the consciousness that decided to randomly divide itself into particles, will remember everything, but not ever feel compelled to test the veracity of its own perfection again. But, what fun to remember everything, every particle, every star, every planet, and the lives of every being, in 360 degree technicolor consciousness, all that came about through its own division into creation. The awe and wonder never ceases ‚ù§
Brian is spectacular, I&#39;ve read all of his books and watched most of the videos on YouTube. Boy, will he be surprised when he dies and joins the universal cosmic consciousness in the  God. There&#39;s just no way that this universe, our consciousness. and everything here just a random collection of particles . It is a carefully designed place precisely tuned so it would be able to cradle life and us and where there is design there is a Creator üòä.. ps also the irony of this interview conducted by a lady whose name is Faith , didn&#39;t escape me üòÖ
So carefully designed that its creator had to send a meteor to wipe out the dinosaurs to let the mammals take over , so well designed that the creator kills children with cancer , so well designed it took 230,000 years for us homosapiens to discover the fundamental laws of nature , improve our understanding and in the process make the welfare of humanity better year in tear out , yet there is absolutely no evidence for a creator what so ever other in the minds of men .
Lol. You are an unthinker.
That was a truly excellent meeting of minds, with the ultimately perfect conclusion that it is about enjoying the moments that we get. Physics is one thing but animal biology is another thing altogether, but what a wonderful opportunity it is that we have the ability in our time to appreciate complex nature can be. <br>Brian‚Äôs wrong though on self determination. A rail track with a carriage, the track determines the range of possible positions the carriage can be, but the carriage determines which of those possibilities suits it best over time. We all have self determination with in the range of possible freedoms and time.
A conversation like this on a Saturday evening in Stockholm is no less than a cosmic blessing! Thanks, Faith, and thanks, Brian!
Very good explanation because people can not understand the relationship between atom and universe and human purpose and function..excellent i can say
The universe doesn&#39;t have a single age. There is no single rate of time or measure of distance in the universe. 13.8 billion years happens in the timespan of 6,000 years depending where you are. The expanded distance in our line of sight between galaxies causes redshift and allows for light to arrive from distant galaxies within our timespand of 6,000 years. There are no inflatons or dark matter particles and the universe is not expanding into oblivion for no reason. GR explains all of our observations such as superluminal motion and things moving faster than expected like the outer spiral arms of galaxies. When you observe a galaxy, it&#39;s not like looking at a cat. You are looking at differing measures of time and distance. Evolution is imagined. No physical thing can ever make or direct itself. Every physical thing is from a supernatural cause. Get used to it and live with it. It&#39;s the reality.
You said the magic word, history. You really need to study ancient history before trying to do science. You wouldn&#39;t be making yourself look so bad if you knew where we came from and why all humans are so similar. We are all the direct descendants of the sixteen original ancient civilizations. Humans went through a bottleneck from the climate change caused by the global flood that destroyed the entire world. It&#39;s the only reason YOU exist. You should be more grateful. Have you ever heard of Assyrians? They are the civilization from Asshur. How about Arameans? Aram. Lydians? Lud. Elamites? Elam. Medes? Madai. Thracians? Tiras. Cushites? Cush. Canaanites? Canaan. Europeans? Gomer. Italians? Tubal Mediterranean Sea people? Javan. North Africans? Phut. Egyptians? Mitzrayim. Asians? Magog. Siberians? Meshek. Jews and Arabs? Arphaxad. You are just making up stuff since you hate the truth in the Bible. Do you want to be ashamed and embarrassed forever? <br><br>There&#39;s more. The Cohen modal haplotype identifies the Israelite tribe of Levi that Moses and Aaron belonged to. So that means Arphaxad&#39;s descendants are everyone with the IJ paternal Y chromosome haplogroup, myself included, believe it or not. The Elamites are the descendants of his younger brother Elam that have the Elamo-Dravidian semitic H haplogroup. The Assyrians are the descendants of their brother Asshur with the G haplogroup. People with the F1 F2 and F3 haplogroups are the descendants of the two youngest brothers Aram and Lud. Then there is a peculiar Hamitic haplogroup in west Asia that is C. They can ONLY be the direct descendants of the &quot;house of Nimrod&quot;, the first king of the world who began building the Tower of Babel. These descendants have a CF SNP marker that they share with the majority of the world&#39;s population while the haplogroups of A, B, D and E of his younger brothers and cousins do not have it. <br><br>There is another Hamitic D haplogroup in Asia near the Denisova Cave and east all the way to Japan that is from the Canaanite tribe of Sinim which is the biblical name for China, hence the name &quot;Sino&quot;, which is also where the word Sinai came from. Denisovans incidentally are a mix of Hamitic and Eurasian lineages. Neanderthals are a Eurasian lineage. That&#39;s the reason Eurasians have the most Neanderthal DNA. The first people in Italy were the descendants of Tubal and today there is still 8% of the population of Central Italy with the K paternal haplogroup. Thracians are L. The Mediterranean descendants of Javan are T. European descendants of Gomer are R. The descendants of the Medes are Q. The other Asians are the O descendants of Magog. Siberians are N from Meshek. A, B and C are Cush (Nimrod is the son of Cush). E1, E2 and E3 are Phut, Canaan and Mitzrayim respectively.<br><br>There is no getting out of it, humans did pass through the bottleneck of the global flood that destroyed the earth. Our geology is the direct result of the global flood. If you understand this, then you can learn to be a good scientist. The Bible names every one of the sixteen of OUR ancient civilizations before they became civilizations. The God of Israel is the only true God.
Please keep working on that one. I&#39;ve been waiting for a good breakdown like that. Let us make man in our image to me also says, why do we need to know that here, or now at this point of the word? It just allowed in my mind plenty of life action in whatever forms before that was said.  So what happened before we were made in Image form?  I don&#39;t have mans begginings here, just modern mans.   And so far, no harm done because we&#39;re saying the Earth is this or that old and God loves science so who knows and science can tell should we be able to stay with it back far enough......   Remember also, anything can happen according to it&#39;s creator.   Those are great odds, take them.

We aren&#39;t anything, just a bunch of egomaniacal blobs walking around spouting goofy stuff like that to puff ourselves up, as if we mean anything AT ALL.  Carl was one of the most egomaniacal of all, just watch Cosmos and see what percentage of the time his giant talking head is on the screen.   Billions and billions...blah blah blah.
Brian&#39;s point here , is that we want the universe to have a purpose and meaning .We long for it to reciprocate our view of it . We cannot cope with the reality that it is just particles and molecules etc., and therefore , we must recognise that the parts of our life experiances that impact our soul are where we should actually invest the concept of meaning.

Many of the brilliant scientists in history were religious. We shouldn&#39;t create a dichotomy between the two. They exist in separate domains, which should not overlap as they contain different epistemologies.
Maybe religion is the manifestation of the &#39;Free Will&#39; problem referred to in this video.We need to believe we have Free Will because the reality of its absence drains our motivation to live.The need to determine our Fate, (when really we can&#39;t) , opens the door for &quot;Faiths&quot; that pander to this psychologically damaging reality. To cope  , many are willing to  ignore scientific facts for unproven/unprovable religious stories.Perhaps  those who don&#39;t need religion are not without Faith , but  actually just better able to cope with the  &quot;Free Will&quot;  issue.
@@kenadams5504 I would agree that believing in free will is a necessity. It not only provides motivation but allows for justice and morality. Without it a murderer can simply stand in court and blame the predetermined interactions of particles in his brain for committing the crime. We must live as though we have free will, regardless whether it is real or an illusion.
@@KAT-dg6el No - I said many were religious, not most.
@@ocean_0602 Of course , but , its also no harm to realise that the laws of physics apply to us in the same way as everything else that consists of particles and molecules. And , therefore , our belief of being free to determine our future is incompatible with the laws of physics .

Not exactly Big Bang but the cyclic expansion and Contraction of the Universe has been postulated by the Buddha 2700 years ago.
That is Interesting.
‚Äã@@j.k.d.126I mean, there are only so many possibilities: the universe can only either stay the same size, expand, contract, or expand <b>and</b> contract. Zero disrespect to the Buddha, but he had a 4 answer multiple choice question and got it right.
a cyclic universe is a dreaful miserable picture. if strictly true, it means we are going to repeat all the horrible suffering all over again. what a nightmare.
@@maxwelldillon4805 In fact, none knows that the truth is! Everyone (Buddha to modern cosmologists) is giving their opinions on the basis of fragmented data. The Universe is so vast and our life-brain are so negligible. That is why, Buddha did not want to give more time in such metaphysical questions. By the way, if you are a graduate in Physics you might have read that Big Bang does not really mean explosion but expansion. Yes, cyclic big crunches give the sense of unending suffering but Buddha also gives the concept of Nirvana (end of suffering). Later Buddhism (4th Century BCE) accepts the atomism but early Buddhism (6th Century BCE) more focused on classical fundamental particles of earth, air, water and fire. When all these fundamental particles are ceased then an individual attain Nirvana. However, even though the Nirvana Concept sounds logical or might be possible to achieve individually but in scientifically it is still not possible to demonstrate.
@@Alex-js5lg I would like to suggest to read Agganna Sutta (in Columbia University Website). Yes, I agree with you. There are several possibilities. I was stating Buddha&#39;s Worldview just to tell that when we talk about Cosmology and Consciousness we must not forget Buddha. Science should be secular. Science must not be Eurocentric. Buddha has great influence on Greek Philosophies, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese and Japanese world views.

Brian I‚Äôve considered the free will thing. I agree and would like to add a bit. <br>All of the chemical processes that take place within our brain an associated with them are summarized by their fundamental particles which exhibit quantum behavior. We are aware that means they behave probabilistic. This makes me have a different perspective. Maybe we still do not have free will. Because any outcome is possible, we perceive free will. Still bound by the physics as you mentioned.

Could it be that consciousness is an undiscovered property of matter that enables free will?
no
Possibly, if there&#39;s some unknown quantum aspect of consciousness. I can&#39;t imagine a way for consciousness to have a direct effect on matter through any classical mechanism. As far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s no evidence to actually suggest that the two concepts are related, but the fact that we don&#39;t understand quantum mechanics theoretically leaves the door open for consciousness to play a role in it.<br><br><b>If</b> (and I really just can&#39;t make that <b>if</b> big enough) consciousness affects quantum outcomes, then surely when millions of neurons act as a collective consciousness by firing in concert and affecting functionally incalculable numbers of quantum outcomes, it would seem to me that that would constitute some form of genuine free will.
Consciousness equals thinking and physics equals matter. Ram Chandra says thought was first created - with &#39;I am&#39; - and then, came fear (of separation).
Freedom is given to us. We are free. We have the free will. Why do you put the law of physics above the freedom? We many times correct the blind path of the law. Don&#39;t you agree?
There is no free will. You are a sheep.
Live in the present it is all we really have!!  Learn from the past and wish for the future.  I would have liked Faith to ask Brian about sitting comfortably in &quot;One&#39;s Own Personal Concisness Bubble&quot; in a crowded nightclub interacting with your friends surrounded by hundreds of people indifferent to your very existence. You get this irresistible urge to look in a specific location behind you and lock eyes with someone specifically checking you out from a distance. Personally, I wonder if this phenomenon has some connection to the observer effect. Thank You!! for the discussion.
God Is all around us people. He interacts from the quantum world and collapses the wave when we get too close. We&#39;re not as smart as him. Have faith Love him and Love each other. God Bless
Brian talks about the romance of math, I only wish I had his experience. I had the opposite experience, math was torture, punishment, etc.. and therefore unpleasant. Yet I always knew in my gut that mathematics was clearly amazingly useful for our lives. So I&#39;m super glad math nerds are with us! Thanks to those who really get it and share their expertise so we can have the chance for survival.

@@mokujin29 yes, no doubt it helps to have an interest in the subject matter. I prefer the written language and have cultivated my writing skills over mathmatical ability.

@@issyjas3309 I think that many &quot;math teachers&quot; at the high school level and especially below that, really have no understanding of what they are teaching outside of having memorized the maths.  If you ask them what practical use some equation may have, a lot of them will have no idea even though they know how to solve it.  Many people have trouble being interested in, and/or learning, something that is just memorization of rules without any info on how and why it was developed and is used for.

@@SkyRiver1 100% this.  Many can&#39;t even articulate an alternative way of working a problem out.  They know the one way the text shows and that is the extent of their knowledge.  I went from being a gifted math student in middle school to failing grade 11 math because I went from naturally understanding to being taught to regurgitate memorized equations.
I like how Brian Greene and Max Tegmark both have the same idea about how we are all just particles.  I was really entertained by this one.
A stupid, futile statement that should impress no one with a modicum of intelligence

‚Äã@@smlanka4u &quot;JWST discovered galaxies older than the Big Bang.&quot; It&#39;s crucial to understand that galaxies being &quot;older&quot; than the Big Bang is physically impossible. Initially, the observation was indeed surprising as galaxies were detected earlier than our models predicted. However, the case of CEERS-93316 was reexamined; originally identified at 250 million years after the Big Bang (redshift z‚âÉ16.4), spectroscopic follow-up revealed a redshift of just z=4.9, around 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. This discrepancy was due to three overlapping properties that simulated the expected colors of a galaxy at z‚âà16 in the analysis.
‚Äã@@otinanisweirdo
‚Äã@@smlanka4uAlso, your statement about black holes growing without absorbing ordinary matter leading to the possibility of a Big Bounce is not supported by current scientific understanding. While black holes can indeed grow in ways other than absorbing ordinary matter, this fact doesn&#39;t directly correlate with theories about the universe&#39;s end or the concept of a Big Bounce. These are intricate topics that can&#39;t be connected in such a straightforward manner.
Wu wei, &#39;ya got it.
How anyone could think it would have been somehow easier, more natural, more logical, etc. for there to have been a fictional metaphysical &quot;nothing&quot; than the &quot;something&quot; everywhere in front of our eyes is beyond me.

I mean, the exact movements and patterns are all part of an apparent equilibrium which seems static in small scale but it&#39;s dynamic in a larger scale. So pretty much nothing has order in the grand scheme of things. Just random stuff. We only look for patterns so that we can do math on it.
Always look forward to any nuggets of truth ‚úùÔ∏è from Brian Green.

Respected British anthropology professor, Dr. Edward Dutton, has demonstrated that ‚ÄúLEFTISM‚Äù is due to genetic mutations caused by poor breeding strategies.<br>ü§°<br>To put it simply, in recent decades, those persons who exhibit leftist traits such as egalitarianism, feminism, gynocentrism, socialism, multiculturalism, transvestism, homosexuality, perverse morality, and laziness, have been reproducing at rates far exceeding the previous norm, leading to an explosion of insane, narcissistic SOCIOPATHS in (mostly) Western societies.

I think the concept of the &quot;end of time&quot; refers to a point far enough into the heat death of the universe when no meaningful interactions can occur. That leaves no way to distinguish the difference between moving backwards and forwards in time. So it&#39;s not that time literally ends, it&#39;s that it becomes kind of meaningless/useless.<br><br>But agreed - it should be interesting!
Its not an error, it is &quot;literature&quot;!
I am not really concerned about what any particular person BELIEVES.

If dark energy were moving through the universe like heat through water, mass should be brought together like foam on the surface. That would require dark energy to move faster than light, maybe with continued influence from the cosmic origin on mass. Or for a strange geometry in time space
I&#39;m confused.  Much of this discussion centers on the idea of demonstrating that gravitational waves exist - in the first place.  But didn&#39;t Taylor and Hulse already demonstrate that in 1974 using pulsar timing measurements at Arecibo with sufficient credibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1993 ?
Dr Chiara is amazing, to be so elegant, clever and explain things so well.

Beautiful people. Beautiful ideas. JF lovely!
An interesting subject for me would be how strings might be in the early universe &amp; whether they have any tendency to clump (build into a quark).
Spacetime does not contain mass or energy. Why does its waving carry energy?
If we cannot see the dark matter, would normal matter be visible from dark matter point of view?
Without Dark Matter the galaxies would not be in place. It holds them together‚ù§

Professor Greene it is such a pleasure to watch these. I will never waste a minute of my life thinking this world is simple and boring. Society has come between greatness and I for far too long. Here I come.
Is it a gravitational wave if the object first comes closer and then goes further away. I observe from afar, does the strength of gravity vary? A normal thing like the tide in the phenomenon?
üôÉüôÉMaybe the universe is not expanding maybe it is us and our measurements that are shrinking.
Interesting how gravity n dark matter/energy affect each other?
Charging a single eggcelle with 0,0002% nano Mandohurts, before combining the following of a single sperm cell dropped at 5 hours intake attraction point from a black hole is plenty enough impulse map vibration for the sperm cell to find the egg on the third side of space, however the expansion after they meet increases the dark ecco in such a way that it rifts up 2 meeting&#39;s galaxys, so is it possible to bend the time with a split in the end so it soften the acceleration when they meet, without using darkyears as measurements ?
I have to say it. The dark matter filiments resemble a neural net.
Thank you! Appreciate  your brilliant Narration surge of expansion etc.. Gives me a window of insight on your cosmology explorations with your telescopic lenses with its varied tech progress! To answer &quot;Why&quot;? ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§for sciences matters Thank you!üòÆ
It‚Äôs enjoyable to see how excited they are discussing these topics. Fascinating stuff when you are in the right frame of mind to truly listen.
great leacture
In my view the phenomenon of gravitational waves indicates that space time is compressible. This indicates that space time has a variable density. I would expect that density to increase in the presence of baryonic matter so that a large amount of mass will bend the path of light in the same way that light passing through air and entering water is bent. I think that Einstein used the wrong terminology to describe this effect: mass does not curve space but rather compresses space. This may indicate that matter doesn‚Äôt exist within space but rather it displaces space. Therefore the larger a mass is the more dense the adjacent space will be.
It is not science. It is pure fantasy. And, yes. I am waiting for cosmology fanatics who will tell me that I do not understand mathematics behind these &quot;theories&quot;.  Theories without any way to be tested.
Dr.brian Greene is the inspiration and one of the revolutionaries of science field who is increasing the awareness about importance of science.
We have no idea what dark matter and dark energy are.  Physicists have ‚Äúfudged‚Äù the formula to get it to agree with what they observe.
In a corner of his house, Dr Brian Greene hosts the most coolest physics forum there is! I only have one question as the result of watching this gravitational discussion.. Is a black hole made of dark energy/matter?
Hi, you could just have a laser source in sphere with bilateral minimal blind spot and achieve the same thing on a smaller scale.
Indians are only contributing scam data and Chinese are only contributing fake data üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How can the fabric of space and time be moving but we are not? This makes zero sense to me
Are we magically exempt from the laws of physics when it comes to gravitational waves? Do we say the Earth is travelling in a straight line as it orbits tthe sun? What the hell is she saying!?
Keep watching Minecraft videos and worshiping whatever clown promises you an afterlife. If you&#39;re genuinely curious just google it you goof.
If black holes absorb other black holes is it possible that they also absorbed the original star the first black hole of the culmination field supernova&#39;d from?

Is anti-matter something that could be in between dark matter and matter? If so would dark matter absorb velocity before matter up until a limit before matter can react?

Is it possible that there is a space that is preexisting that our universe is expanding to fill, and what looks like a force pushing out and expanding the universe is actually a vacuum pulling out?
Thank you Dr Greene! I&#39;m just a regular guy who works in a factory, but the nature of reality is very important to me. Thank you for bringing this data and these ideas to people like me.
We are all just regular people trying to understand shit. Job and social status are not that important for the desire to understand these things in my opinion.

I&#39;ve been reading Brian Greene for don&#39;t know how long, but <i>seeing</i> him visibly enjoy the same topics that intrigue us, too, is another matter, a <i>light</i> matter.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJuOQWCyMAc&amp;t=1934">32:14</a>  One of my puppies did that tonight, but he also snapped his leash. So, naturally, I&#39;m wondering whether or not spacetime or its fields could snap from the tension on them? Would they form new loops of the string, vibrating at new relative frequencies and so as different particles?
Excellent interviews, so informative. Dr. Greene brings out the best in his guests.
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
... or at the  <i>very</i>  least we start looking/thinking in these other ways, or directions.<br><br>ive become more and more disappointed over the last 20...30 &#39;odd years because of the unwillingness to even think in these... other ways.<br><br>admittedly its taken me most of that same time to open up to them,<br><br>I was very &#39;science only/has all the answers&#39; based and unwilling to examine these &quot;so called&quot; fringes<br>but, if honest they are just other ideas /points of view and in many cases being thought of, or believed in for much longer.<br><br>i sometimes wonder if this build up of &quot;dark matter /energy&quot; (2 other words for... we don&#39;t know)<br>is the &#39;manifestation&#39; of the enormous amount of information  we have generated in the last few hundred years<br><br>painted onto higher dimensional &#39;shaped&#39; objects that we can only see/interact with the equivalent of a shadow, or reflection of our &#39;every day&#39; objects<br><br>a reflection/shadow of something having vast amounts of near massless, but seemingly correct information about the objects<br>but only when viewed in a very certain way<br>like slices of the 3d object does when viewing in flatland/lower dimensions...<br><br>I hope that makes some sense üòä

I&#39;ve been posting this story for a while, now.  Is it possible it&#39;s related to gravitational waves?<br>Time is fascinating. I worked the subway stations for nearly 10 years. From one end of the city to the other. Every so often I would notice the city would be saying that, &quot;Today just flew by&quot; or &quot;The day was just dragging along.&quot;¬† How can an entire city, with no interaction with each other until they used the subway, complain about the same time paradox unless it was effected by it? Maybe a time distorted bubble the earth passes through in its revolution around the sun. Maybe random waves of time distortion hitting the earth? Maybe they&#39;re given off by the sun. Maybe they&#39;re from outside our Terran system and reach us in intervals. ???? Ti-i-i-ime, is on my side. Yes, it is!<br>If you can think of a better way to do a blind survey of an entire city, in the small window of opportunity, I&#39;m all in.¬† Until then, I invite you to spend a couple years in the subways, during rush hour and you&#39;ll see for yourself.¬† Just listen as an entire city gets off of work and gets out of school.¬† You&#39;ll see it&#39;s more than a, &quot;coincidence of circumstances.&quot;

Then there&#39;s Outside the Local Group time bubble.¬† So on and so on until we get outside any influence and into the, &quot;True Interstellar Time Standard.&quot; Or, &quot;T.I...&quot; ;-P<br>Now that &quot;V-ger&quot; is outside our Sun&#39;s reach, in interstellar space, it&#39;s now in the Milky Way&#39;s faster moving, Interstellar Time or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;¬† This can be proven by turning off everything except its clock and transmitter.¬† Have &quot;V-ger&quot; read time for as long as possible.¬† They WILL show the flow of time speeds up the further away you get from any celestial bodies.¬† Until you reach the Milky Way&#39;s time standard or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot;<br>‚Ä¢Our sun&#39;s time bubble: &quot;Terran Time&quot; we know and have measured.¬† In a lifetime, our head is one second younger than our feet.<br>‚Ä¢Milky Way&#39;s time bubble or &quot;Mikey&#39;s Time.&quot; The rate/flow of TIME outside any influence but within the Milky Way: We just got there and are still figuring what the difference is.

Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis <br><br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of matter? Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can also be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the ‚Äúfabric‚Äù of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point leaving pockets of inelastic spacetime geodesic that cause gravity without the presence of matter? <br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn‚Äôt expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn‚Äôt require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it‚Ä¶
Why only two arms for LIGO? Wouldn&#39;t a ‚Äú3D mesh‚Äù of arms give us much better detail? Surely we could separate out the direction and magnitude of the waves with an array of detectors.
A Fan Causes Ripples In The Air, But Could Also Be Like A Reptile Shedding It&#39;s Skin In All Directions And More Frequently?!?

Oh nonononono. Again,
In a tug of war game, both of team members are on the same ground (same plane).  What about tug of war in our solar system?  Are their orbits on the same plane or changing time to time?

Welcome to the PTA meeting.
Why are those scientists shaking their heads so much? Does this help with thinking or are it the gravitational waves?
So gravitational waves are not effected by time dilation?<br>When two BHs are merged, time is slowed down relative to the earth.  Like a movie &quot;Interstellar&quot;, one hour on the planet next the BH was 7 years on the earth relatively.  So say it took 2 seconds at the last moment of the merge and we here on Earth detected it.  It&#39;s still the same 2 seconds?  No time delation?  Would that mean there&#39;s no &quot;red-shift&#39; because of the expansion of the universe, spacetime?
Lies and propaganda...Good luck

Gravitational Wavea aren&#39;t real. Famously, scientists even aren&#39;t clear yet what is gravity itself...
neat!
Brian greene is one of my favourite physicist and I eagerly wait for his videos as they give us an edge to think over the research related ideas ...He is one of the best and amazing speakers.
Gosh, Brian has to be the hardest working physicist. Bravo ‚ù§
Happy day, happy day! Thank you Dr. Greene!
Roger Penrose suggested that in our universe there could be Gravitational Waves from Black holes coming from a previous universe in the very far past. If such a previous universe Existed and if Black hole morgens emitted gravitational waves: could these waves be measured with the Neutron Star method? Or would such waves Still be beyond our reach and not a Potential source?
How wonderfully blessed we are to live among such brilliant Minds <br>who continually and doggedly peel back the many layers of secrets <br>our Universe holds.  Stunningly impressive and inspirational work.<br>Thank you Prof. Greene for introducing these amazing people to us.<br>Chiara is a very talented science communicator.
Also, how counter-intuitive is it to hear something as compact as <br>a neutron star be described as &#39;squishy&#39;, but that black holes <br>which are essentially extreme gravitational wells in spacetime, be described <br>as being &#39; hard &#39;, and not deforming under these extreme conditions. <br>Mindblowing stuff.
I&#39;ve always been curious about the structure of the universe, like if we could map out the universe in an I instance of time, mapping light years. What would that look like
Lets suppose that the universe is an entity that would cause gravitational forces to other objects outside of itself. if that gravity couldnt go anywhere, what would happen? if it is able to impose itself outside of the universe what would happen from our perspective? is it possible that time itself is another form of gravity like xrays are another form of light?
A solar system sized black hole.. orbiting another black hole the size of our solar system... That&#39;s some serious imagery. Even though we don&#39;t know why gravity is. I love you world science festival

Thank you, most interesting, I hope to travel to NYC in September.
I miss those long Q&amp;A Brian that you did during the pandemic <br>Feel a nostalgia for those days.
As a layman in this area ... <br>I understand that two orbiting masses should spin arround each other forever ... but they loose velocity and collide and one way they loose that energy is by dispersing gravitational waves. Is this correct? If so it then implies that energy is required to change the state of gravity. It also implies that there&#39;s a direct similarity between electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves. It&#39;s just at a different scale.
Oh shoot! I missed being here when you were live.  So glad to see you doing these again!
I want to formulate a new theory of the existence of a particle that ensures symbiosis of a biophysical system, considering it to be a first step in accommodating this great flow of energy, which follows to be assimilated through applied technology. Thank you!
Thank you Brian, your team and guests for another wonderful session. I am very much just a layman but I have always thoroughly enjoyed your work and I  appreciate the work and effort to keep the broader public informed on the cutting edge of subjects in science in general, especially the physics and cosmological topics.<br>Thank you from the UK.
Awesome! Best start to my Saturday morning walk
Hi Brian... Regarding reversibility, it is a very important topic, what makes the transition between the relative dimension and a new dimension of resonance energy, being considered  that a system of human accommodation with the environment. It represents a symbiosis of matter to future conditions of existence.Regarding gravitational waves, it is good to understand this inexhaustible source of energy to be assimilated by technology, to be supported by living matter, the conversion of this energy gravitational, in resonance energy that can be used in different fields of activity. Regarding the black holes of the Universe, I consider them to be the accumulation of large amounts of energy,in a perpetual transformation, this wonderful event horizon...respectively I consider it to be a great gravitational potential, a great amount of energy in a continuous transformation...Let&#39;s remember the bell effect, which provides both the sound effect through resonance, but also the disinfection of a biophysical system, but also of the respective environment. The same is true of these black holes, which through this bell effect ensures the cleanliness of the Universe Thank you!

I Really like the idea of space being a partical
Very eloquent presentation! Although i would be curious mister Greene to hear your real point of view on a foundation that it‚Äôs main goal is to blur the laypeople about a non existing relation between two incompatible identities‚Ä¶
I still have no idea what cosmic strings are ^^ I wished he would have used more a mathematical description. Now, I am not sure if he talks about topology or geometry or fields or if it just was a nice image.
Here we study in space, gravity, etc. What could and should be right. So, what exists?  What is everything already?   Think about what we study in that of which we create.  If we create those waves themselves, then what can we do with them.   Like poop. If we make poop, what can we do with it?    Where is the Earth located in the universe?   Are we on one end or another?  Are we in the middle of it?   Is there a map to the universe inside our heads yet to be discovered? How can we put one there? Can you download a memory, what would that consist of and look like, for me in my minds eye, and for others by using technology and things?   Question is,  why travel in the universe using material kind, if we can utalize our minds and do so too?  Perhaps a hybride type of control would be sufficient.
Hi Guys; what&#39;s the force carrier for the G wave and/or the medium transferring the wave energy across space? Please disregard the headlights and get out of the roadway.
Dark energy is clearly a particulate coupling effect where high z clusters show common disk galaxy plane orientation with the same  axis extension in the direction of red shift propagation. The galaxies are exhibiting a &quot;windsock effect&quot; forcing the disks into the laminar gravity flow that couples with the baryons to extend orbits in the direction of red shift. This concept of a laminar flow of quantum gravity is consistent with a gravity working fluid that has diminishing effectiveness as gravity while increasing its effectiveness as the space-time viscosity working fluid. I.E. fast gravity creates gravitational propulsion while slow gravity increases space-time viscosity that manifests as dark energy. The Hubble Constant just measures how much of the gravity flux is slowed to impotency over a megaparsec.

JWT IS SO IMPRESSIVE. What many may not realize is that IF EXOPLANETS are found Say - 1/3 of way across the Galaxy (Milky Way) - That Planet&#39;s Light has been traveling to Earth for 30,000 to 50,000 Years. A lot could have happened since then. For Galaxies Millions of Light Years away, that could be a lot of change...or evolution.

The notion of life needing water on planets where liquid diamond rains, in wildly different environments than Earth seems biased and unscientific.
:)
Dr Greene is such a great host and presenter. I think his most admirable quality, besides his intellect, is his low ego. He doesn&#39;t have to act like the smartest person in the room (cough cough Neil deGrasse Tyson) and let&#39;s others teach him (and us) in a very comfortable and non combative way.
Generally speaking the smartest people in the room usually don&#39;t mind not being thought of as the smartest person in the room.  Only those who have egos with something to prove are the ones who need to be known as the smartest person in the room.

allin rimay Brian
A few things. She keeps saying dust ice clouds? Those all are biological processes. Dust is organic, ice is frozen liquid water or transition metal, and clouds of particles?  4 seasons ? You only need four season if you have a plant cycle or something similar. Also she says they have to proint the telescope at a Star first to the capture an image of Neptune/Uranus.. lol. The truth is all between the lines and poor use of words as descriptions. In or outside the lexicon of Astrophysics and Asto-Bio-Chemistry.
OMG, all they show are simulations, cartoons. DID WEBB BLOW UP?<br>ANSWER ME THIS<br>Since galaxies travel in space time as they cross the universe, emitting light along the way, then we should be able to observe the same galaxy at different places in the sky, different places in the life of the galaxy and universe, by figuring out the direction of the galaxy and its speed, then mapping the universe forward and backward in spacetime and making observations there. IN OTHER WORDS,, as an example, If Galaxy A is observed to be 1 billion light years away when the telescope aims at in say in Andromeda, and we could extrapolate or guess which way it came and/or which way it is going then we could find it elsewhere in the sky, say at 2 billion years ago, and half a billion years ago. WHERE IS THIS WRONG?
Sorry to say that about the space water , when the creation of the earth God separate half of the water on Earth and the half to up side and the middle place is called space see Bible (Genesis 1: 1-8) <br>this is made on second day here the earth is having water but the upper water , the earth is made by 24 hours 12 hours day and 12 hours night but to know sky water actually while creation God added.2 more means 3 planets or something like this that these are the numbers 10 and 12 for 10  is 25 or 55 and 12 is 26 as 66 each one is having the separate meaning and to tell about 10 and 12 called J and L means in Indian language water and normally where the water there must be fish so 25 is as 55 and 26 is called 12 here 5 5 12 called EEL the name of the fish the secret is after number 10 the next number is 11 and 12  is as in neumaralagi 1 is A so 10 11 12 as  J AA L means in Indian language Hindi meaning net the fishing net so we must know that there is water  and normally the place is called God place where God is sitting on the 11 the number is invisible the size is as  each one is the length is 18 and the width 12 as each 29 and 26 as called 1290 and 1260 and 1290 1260 as 49 is 9999 =36 and 46 is 6666= 24 as the same earth measurements and each number that is 11 is having the name called Jehovah and Boez means Jesus Christ see Bible ( 1Kings 7::15) and right side J  left side L the Jesus Christ and the Lucifer sitting so this is called the thrown of God and the Earth is God&#39;s threshold hold thanks

She exuded all the excitement! Loved this conversation!
The moment a particle is a wave; it has to be a conscious wave!  <br>Gravity is the conscious attraction among waves to create the illusion of particles, <br>    and our experience-able Universe.     <br> Max Planck states: &quot;Consciousness is fundamental and matter is derived from Consciousness&quot;.<br> <br>Life is the Infinite Consciousness, experiencing the Infinite Possibilities, Infinitely.           <br>We are &quot;It&quot;, experiencing our infinite possibilities in our finite moment. <br>Our job is to make it interesting!
Max was on some very good drugs at the time, and in one hell of a &#39;we&#39;re everything&#39; circle jerk.  Masergy is an old concept.  Gravity creating particles seems far fetched, and  it being conscious is absurd.  Mankind thinks it&#39;s the center of the universe, making goofy statement like &#39;we are the universe trying to understand itself, when in reality we are, in total, probably completely inconsequential.

My theory on how the earth got it&#39;s water; which I will call &quot;theory Z&quot; is that earth started out as an icy comet about the size of the moon, gets trapped in this orbit that then got bombarded by rocks and other debris which sank into the melting ice. Besides; how can you account for the 70/30 ratio, which to me sounds absurd, that all these so-called icey comets deposited all this water????
Not so comfortable with your theory, <br>I&#39;m also studying, about it
Thank you, Dr. G. You attract the most interesting guests for the most interesting subjects. This has been one of the best. Dr. Milam is an excellent communicator with a deep knowledge of her subject. Thank you both.
Not showing us the images you are talking about really sucks
Earth&#39;s water came mostly from the Sun: protons reached Earth&#39;s oxygens and still reaching and producing water in Earth&#39;s atmosphere.
LISTEN KIDS (in short, the real world has two fields who form one particle electron=photon: magnetic is perpendicular to the plane of whirpool which produces electric field falling into that whirpool and emerging as magnetic field), THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS REVEALED IN THE YEAR 2000 (I just needed to learn English to transfer it to you): electron is photon (electron is a real atom which is a manifestation of electric and magnetic perpendicular fields like whirpool or eddy or black hole), left and right electrons form neutrino, gravity is uncompensated (or relativistic) electric field of proton (smaller particles consist of bunch of electrons and gravity there is called strong and weak force/field), proton consist of approx 2000 electrons, neutron is electron plus proton, light has no colors since it is a bunch of photons at various distances between themselves traveling in the same direction like thrown sand particles in the air, the red shift is not only due to Doppler effect, but and due to spatial dispersion both due to angular divergence and due to absorption of some photons by matter particles on the path (overall effect is red shift, like averaged distances between photons=electrons falling on averaged areas gives a sensation of frequency and color), a single photon has got no frequency. Universe is INFINITE and ETERNAL, we just cannot see (and will never be able) very deep in space since the lack of PHOTONS reaching us.
So maybe a lack of water is why life is so rare in the universe?

Of course our solar system is unique Brian, it‚Äôs the only one we know of to have life.
That doesn&#39;t mean that it is unique at all.  The thing that would make it unique, by definition, is if it were the only system where that is true, and we have no way to know, either way.  I expect that solar systems with life are literally a dime a dozen, and unlike ours some probably include intelligent life.  <br><br>I propose that ours does not, since the only species claiming to demonstrate signs of intelligence is crapping in the only kitchen it has, and maybe to the point already where the end is nigh, not today or tomorrow, but not that many  years away, either.
AWESOME !!!!!!  üëæ
We learn at a fast pace today one answer in Physics leads to more than a hundred questions and yes we are leap-frogging our knowledge of the Cosmos the major factor is that we have JWST to quantify what we think we are really looking at what it means to us for our future, The Cosmos is like a super colossal pinball machine things come in and things disappear in microseconds I hope what we find out is accurate enuff to help us make the major changes to our knowledge that we need to survive and maybe keep our planet Earth in the condition that helps us. I truly love the interest and comments said here.
Where did the water from mars+atmosphere go to?

Do we have rings around Earth such as this that are detectable with James Webb telescope ?
I don&#39;t buy the meteor theory. The debris that eventually formed earth are not as barren as you think. They&#39;re the same rocks and ice that are floating around in the solar system today. Water is simply hydrogen and oxygen. When the earth cooled down, don&#39;t you think H2O can form naturally in the surface and depths of the planet??

Great video.  Thank you Dr Greene and Dr Milam.  I bet Carolyn Porco was doing cartwheels about al of these observations and especially when she saw the ring structures of Uranus and Neptune, and when she sees the other ring structures hinted at around other planets (Jupiter, etc).  Dr Porco and her colleagues pushed to get Voyager 2 to look for ring arcs around Uranus in 1987 and Neptune in the 1989.  Watch The Planets and see how inspiring and infectious Dr Porco&#39;s wonderful enthusiasm is.
Modern cosmology is a secular religion. People like Brian Greene have been Pavlovian conditioned to think circularly-reasoned illogical nonsense makes sense. You cannot reason with religious folk. The Big Bang Universe and the rest is the result of a prejudice that promotes confirmation bias over honesty. These people cling to their beliefs like good Christians from Medieval times would.

If water is so important why are we allowing Fukushima Japan to dump nuclear waste into Ocean?
Because Godzilla!
Question 4: Where did the asteroids get their water from?
I have read or seen video somewhere that explaned this.The water is created in formation of stars. All starts in particle level. The birth of star and its solar system is like machine that throws out elements and in right temperature, pressure, radiation and distance from the sun if there is right building elements and usually there is you get water. Actually if we look at all these recent findings water is not so rare in universe and how could it be.üòÇ It is just that usually it is not in right form if we look at it from life&#39;s perspective. In the early time of formation of the star there is a sphere/distance from star where this is possible and I suppose all these rocky objects just need to fly through or be formed in this area to get water with them.<br><br>I heard that The Earth is loosing more water than getting it at the moment. Lucky us we still have relatively good amount it left.<br><br>Just let me know if this theory sounds completely wrong.üòä Actually this made me thinking when this water formation ends, is it still going on? Obviously happens somewhere but still in our solar system? Maybe too old system allready.
@@TideOfStamps sounds plausible. Thanks for taking the time to elaborate!
It wasn&#39;t that long ago we debated free choice. Maelstrom of subatomic particles do not wait for us to make a decision. The indescribable  vast brain and nerve dendrites connections give no clue to how a thought propagates meaningfully in real time (Jon Lieff MD) We are made of inorganic dust from burnt out Sun&#39;s. Ash from the interstellar clouds and cold quantum chemistry. When life dies there is really no change in the elements that make us up. There are no theories that predict life as a convergent property of the universe. If there was life would be everywhere yet we walk among a thin film of life on a horse with no name breathing an atmosphere that supports life less than five miles up. All life is inherited. Explaining everything as evolution is like understanding fire as phlogiston. AI is inheriting life from us. It may be that life requires more degrees of freedom than our universe allows never generating life once it&#39;s algorithm is broken. We only find life by comparison with ourselves. Yet follow our inherited life back through space and time and somewhere in the primordial universe our blueprint existed. Life should be everywhere or nowhere. We are discovering that we are a broken symmetry a paradox. How could the certainty of you reading this exist 13.799 billion years ago and be unscathed by inflation of the universe and supernovae? Not long ago we were writing this on leathers scrolls.
Origin of Life: no more answers than in the 80&#39;s. Still more questions than answers. I won&#39;t call the title Click BAIT, but just be clear. The theories and stories of the origin of life have not changed in 40 years.
Great Video thanks for sharing!
Brian Greene is one of my favourite physicists, not just for his obvious brilliance, but also because of his entire approach to the subject. You&#39;ll never hear him disparage others, and he has a healthy amount of respect even for non-scientists. Consider the way he engages with this other brilliant physicist: Stefanie Milam. Unlike, say, Lawrence Kraus or Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he actually allows the guest to speak. All of which leaves you thinking you&#39;ve learned something, even if you haven&#39;t:)
He probably isn&#39;t among the very top thinkers in his choice of science, but he is a great communicator and intermediator/moderator and thus he has found his role in science - to communicate scientific progress in an up to date fashion to laymen and academics alike. He is so darned amicable and he can keep focus even after careful listening to what the other persons have to say. He doesn&#39;t interrupt and he most often follows up on what the other persons are saying instead of statingly going back to his script. Or maybe he does, but it doesn&#39;t show. I want to listen to him. He is the right person at the right place.
@@rogerman65 Alas, I&#39;m not qualified to assess his choice of science, for I managed to leave school without ever being able to solve a single equation. So to me, anyone who can is a genius by definition.  Besides, I don&#39;t think you can have his kind of biography by being second-rate, quite aside from regularly engaging with the likes of Penrose on equal terms.
@@rogerman65 What do you mean? Physicists are unlikely to be top thinkers?
@@akpanekpo6025 You are right, he is not second rate. He is just not among the absolute top scientists. He is however among the absolute top of thinking people altogether. But who am I to tell. Except, this isn&#39;t a thesis, it&#39;s my sqribble on a Youtube-channel&#39;s comment section. I am not that great at math either, but neither am I a top scientist.
I&#39;ve discovered Neil DeGrasse Tyson is not the sharpest tack in the box after watching for years.  I have to turn away if I even hear him.  Brian Greene is awesome because he evokes child-like wonder in the rest of us.
I don&#39;t want to think I&#39;ve learned something , unless I&#39;ve actually learned something.
@@knowledgetracker Alas, I lack the knowledge to asses him as a scientist, but I doubt he&#39;s as research-active as the likes of Greene, given his non-academic position. He has of course written some books, but books (as opposed to journal articles) tend not to be peer-reviewed; so unless his are, he&#39;d not be in the same league as Greene, in my view.<br><br>But one thing is beyond doubt about Tyson: he&#39;s a loudmouth and a smart alec, who literally loves his own voice so much he never allows even his guests to finish a sentence.

I get the impression that Neil is more interested in promoting Neil, a bit like, dare I say it, Mr billions and billions himself, Carl Sagan.  If you watch Carl&#39;s show what you see more often than not is his face spanning the entire screen, and him droning on about one thing or another.  And when Neil said he didn&#39;t understand why there was microgravity on the ISS I laughed.  I&#39;m not a physicist, but rather a retired engineer, and I got one of those record scratch moments when I heard that.  The answer is pretty much first year physics level.   <br><br>As far as Carl goes, I laughed to tears when he talked about some civilization picking up one of the Voyager probes, like it would be more likely that they would find some car sized dead as a nail hunk of junk than say maybe our RF transmissions.  Just dumber than a stump, and brilliant, all at the same time. <br><br>And don&#39;t even get me started on that stupid Drake equation.  As a notional tool to open the thinking I have no problem with it, as an equation to explain why we don&#39;t hear from anybody when we &#39;should&#39;, it is just inane.  Let&#39;s see, let me pull a set of parameters based on wild guesses out of my butt, add them together, and get something useful...good luck with that.   IMO, managing the 10k year span of a technical civilization they used (IIRC) is beyond ludicrous, looking at where we seem to be heading right now, destroying the only spaceship we have to support our existence.  @@knowledgetracker

@@akpanekpo6025 u mm no none, since Hawking, seems to engage Penrose on equal terms. I saw Hossenfelder take on Penrose but I don&#39;t have the equipment to know if she can match him. My prejudice is that if you can find time to make popular science videos he you are not a first rate nutty professor. Or maybe she just wants to improve on an academic&#39;s earnings
@@vvanderer You don&#39;t have to have &quot;the equipment&quot; to know whether two scientists are an intellectual match. All you need is the ability to follow the discussion (which can be hard or even impossible for non-scientists, I concede), and you can tell when a punch is being landed, so to speak. For example, in a debate about Penrose&#39;s conformal cyclic cosmology, I recall Hossenfelder pointing out that because it&#39;s unfalsifiable, it&#39;s not a scientific theory even though it&#39;s supported by maths - and like Pentose, she&#39;s a serious mathematician. (For what it&#39;s worth, I watched her eviscerate Eric Weinstein too - no, I don&#39;t like that aspect f her personality either.)<br><br>As for her YouTube videos, no insult intended, but you misunderstand the nature of her chosen field: theoretical physics. For as Pentose himself once explained in response to an interview question (about what he actually does, day-to-day), &quot;all you need is a piece of chalk&quot;. In other words, because your work mainly involves mathematical calculations, you don&#39;t need to spend any time in a lab or behind a telescope, to do serious research. Note, in any event, that Hossenfelder isn&#39;t an academic but primarily a researcher (and like Penrose, with PhD candidates to supervise, though Penrose held an academic post), a position she can&#39;t hold without being research-active. By her own account, her videos are her way of escaping from the intensity of her research.
@akpanekpo6025¬† I will defend to the death my profession of scientific ineptitude.and yes, researcher. I conflate because her job is what  most academics regard as the main task, adding to the  corpus of knowledge, supervising doctoral candidates etc. But I do holdthat true brainiacs don&#39;t have room for anything  else

Can we meet the Gods halfway? Obviously, the purpose of science is to find out HOW this dang solar system formed. I am not insinuating that we wave our hands and say &quot;The Gods did it all,&quot; nor am I saying the answers can be found in studying matter harder. I am thinking here of the old trope that this Universe is on a computer in an Alien teenager&#39;s basement, and this leads conclusively to the fact that there was a PROCESS that all these planets accumulated their constituents. Some big machine put the planets in orbit? And this machine disintegrated after doing its job? What I propose is that, due to the overwhelming size of mystery in each of our eight planets, we must assume something out of the ordinary. Something that is not JUST GRAVITY AND MATTER doing its thing, but something MYSTERIOUS. Can we at least put pins into mysteries like why galaxies are different from solar systems (dark matter), why some planets have rings, why the moons of planets don&#39;t have moons, where all this dang water came from on Earth alone, etc. etc. etc. I propose perhaps we let just a little metaphysics into the physics conversation.

Just like the shaft is cooled to produce force in Nuclear Plants. The oort cloud is a possibility of having metals and water in asteroids revolving due to Sun&#39;s Gravity so create a spherical band of metal and water. The direction the asteroids in the OORT cloud move, the electromagnetic flux produced by the moving asteroids is stabilized to create a field, that shuns outside Solar System Radiation. That is why water is required.

Copied from my last night comments and happy to watch this tonight. I went to school without laboratory <br><br>I don&#39;t consider myself a science because I am not. And I don&#39;t want even to make efforts to acquire titles attached with my name because that is gonna create personal actualization which is a big cause of many human faults as it creates higher expectations from other people and that person who holds those titles tries to defend them by all costs whether in political or in business instead of acting and interacting with people as a normal human being who makes mistakes, who learns new things, who doesn&#39;t know many of the things who accepts and admits faults honestly, who asks forgiveness when they hurt others and compensate others if they did anything bad to countable (physical) by actions and regrets and apologizes when they hurt others in words and make much effort in self discipline of never hurting any one intentionally but that is not passive quality and weakness. Who doesn&#39;t regret and doesn&#39;t hesitate to denounce horrible acts including theirs first and then other people&#39;s <br><br>This topic of food security was well addressed which when lacked creates &quot;food insecurity&quot;<br><br><br>But quite different topic,  I often hear climate change and climate justice and that countries most affected by climate crisis are the poorest.<br><br>I also hear carbon dioxide (CO2) discussed which is the gasses animal breath out (exhalation process) and plants take. Ok.<br><br>We also know that carbon monoxide is (meaning carbon with single oxygen at molecule level) reaction of two elements at gas state (substance state .... solid .... liquid and gas). Ok. This state is always due to the level of temperature (0 degree is the center) above 0 degree is hot or + and below is cold at substance level not human level because water is the center or queen measurement used at classification with the temperature so 0 deg is the freezing (ice point of water) which is two elements of hydrogen and one element of oxygen at molecule level or you can forgive me and say two atoms and one atom at this level because element is made up of atoms. Ok. <br><br>Carbon monoxide needs more chemical reactions and that is why it takes one more oxygen to become stable at the electrons +- (loosing and gaining between the elements in reaction) gases which are usually in the category of the periodic table in chemistry depending on the electrons cycle in outer layer with the atoms to create elements and between the chemicals (with other elements to create molecules). <br><br>First, carbon is eating the oxygen usually present in the lower atmosphere as gas. I said as a gas because with water it needs process to purity from it. Ok. <br><br>When temperature of the earth goes up, snows will heat up and make rivers to follow to the seas because sea level is the lowest of the earth and that why altitude is measured from the sea level.<br><br>Can we imagine the level of effects of such water follow not only in erosion but also every thing else. We can even bear in rain floods. But I hope, I am wrong and the solid snow oceans, seas and on lands are already in the sea level and will not make any water follow.

This is my hypothesis. The enigmatic nature of black holes and solving the information paradox. In this theoretical framework, the photon sphere of the black hole acts as a &quot;white hole&quot; emitting information in the form of Hawking radiation. This emitted radiation, being a quantum state vector, imprints onto the holographic screen surrounding the black hole as a lattice of qubits or &quot;Plixels.&quot;<br><br>The lattice of qubits represents the encoded quantum information about the properties and characteristics of objects that have fallen into the black hole. The mathematical information contained in this quantum state vector describes various attributes, including velocity, acceleration, and the probability of spin states.<br><br>This novel approach hints at a new type of physics that explores the relationship between black holes, quantum mechanics, and information theory. The idea of a holographic universe, programmed with bits of light in the form of Hawking radiation and encoded onto the lattice of qubits, holds the potential to unveil profound insights into the fundamental workings of our universe.

Amazing interview with a true champion of modern cosmology. <br>His historical perspective on the development of the CMB and the Std model is priceless.<br>At the end, thanks to Brian&#39;s cunning open question, several hard issues were posed for future generations.<br>Peebles is in favor of keeping the fundamentals and focuses on correcting the details. <br>Fortunately, so many of the details need ammendment that there&#39;s plenty of room to review the foundations as well.
Fascinating discussion, especially concerning Professor Peebles‚Äô clear description of his creative and curious approach to understanding the universe.
The disc nature could also be related to massive magnetic fields being created by the Black hole also limiting the position of surrounding stars. Again just guesses. If you think about magnetic field patterns there are loops to the &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; with the lines eminating more to the east and west which could help to constrain stars into the planes without the loops but more linear features on the &quot;East&quot; &quot;West&quot; planes.
The real question is why there are massive clumps of matter to form Galaxies but with such great distance between, as the material concentrates it increases the distance and thus vacuum energy between it and another galaxy which helps to explain the growing distances but why there is distance in the First place seems puzzling.
As a guess, I think the black holes and surrounding stars are forming concurrently so questions of what came first are not the key to it. I am guessing due to the jets that eminate from the developing Black hole that material cannot surround the Black hole in a ball shape and thus forces the stars to spiral in a disc plane, the energies involved in the jets wouldn&#39;t allow for stars to surround the Black hole in a ball like fashion, hence the disc like fashion.  Just a guess.

Brian and James, the existence of Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Black Holes and Gravitational Waves emanating from outer space are important. But it cannot solve the most pressing problems in physics since the 17th century up to now, which is the True Nature of Gravity much less shed light on the Dark Universe. An empirical Quantum Theory of Gravity would. And it will also complete our understanding of how and why Gravity works. But it will, at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira‚Äôs Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>‚ÄúThe greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.‚Äù<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>‚àÜQGOœÅ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>‚àÜQGFœÅ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>‚ÜìŒ± is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2.

Wow, Brian ok; nok orher guy
The Universe is not dark !<br><br>Darkness is the result of Stars EXHAUSTED DEAD Photons within a Solar System, which has no traction in Empty Space between Star, thus it tag&#39;s along on the Energy&#39;s of LIVING Photon&#39;s.
Cosmic Microwave background cannot be presently Standing in one piece against an Expanding Universe.<br><br>Even more qualified is this Universal Law,  the Stronger Energy Flow overrides the Weaker Energy Flow at all times,  which certainly would&#39;ve destroy that Cosmetic Microwave background.
It&#39;s this program, World Science Fair, the internet itself, the sharing of information and technology as well as our personal experiences many in visual representation linked in more and more various digestible ways to learn and link science excited minds.. we as an organic network of theory processing and abstract visual computation in realtime as we watch things brought to life in sci-fi and computer simulations as well as instructional or informative videos and diagrams on screens barely variable in any real distinguishing way from what&#39;s seen inside the frames of our phones, tablets, other screen displays and what is outside the frame unfolding in front of us.. and the new clarity brought with AI processing probability sets and large information in instrument readings weaved to simulations or digital photographs like the new and amazing beyond initial estimates, the James Webb space Polaroider (wait, that&#39;s the other side of the paradox) telescope - we all can digest these ultra refined images of the cosmos to act as a network of resonation electromagnetic organic processors working in chaos theory connection to solve an issue baked deep in science and astrophysics, that we are the very evolution as an assimilation system advancing to build their own simulation and assimilation technology and techniques, another permiable transfer, if resonant harmonized enough, now pressure excited and concentrated (by earth&#39;s recent less promising future under current human environmental factors and the trend in a continuous procrastination by government and big business to change at a pace even worthy of hope in help from our constituents)...we have seen the world&#39;s scientists sharing on levels previously taboo, asking the public directly for help in model processing, this toward a solution in satisfying the model for physics and a unified theory for gravity, in most part responsible for the shaping of the very building fabric and energy as a weaving of reality into nature as we experience it to be. It&#39;s likely our clunky nature as oxygen excited and fleeting energy woven water bags wave phased to an inverse harmony of the noise enigmatic whine of the earth&#39;s crust and electromagnetic thermodynamic energy evolved to excited fields and energy waves of our own beamed as far as outside the heliopause and back. I&#39;m here to enlighten you all. Space-time is a neutrino ocean. Lightspeed is relative if electrons inertia can be too as well as spacetime variable in bounce refraction against even a single photon excitement. It is only in passive observation that we will not get the wave function collapse in earths magnetosphere. As we know that light more concentrated than a microscope cable of seeing the plank length will burn a wormhole in space-time.. it is in building observational theories behind the photon enlightening, we will always get superposition with photons being moved as they illuminate a technology and then the concentration of a collapse reminiscent feature, the photons now still (but actually in phase harmony, void of refractive bounce) lay in normal wave function collapse patterns in a 2 slit concentration. We must build observation techniques for particals that doesn&#39;t involve direct observations in light
A bounce sure. Kind of. But not first. This, unless the creator(s) are going to publish their work for us here soon.. we might just need to take the que and resonate to a little more evolved position on what we all understand about science thus far as a human concept. This is a heavy dose of socialized principles, environmental factors, system and control limitations, but more than anything, a deep need to be special ourselves, singular in praise at the grandest stages... this brings heavy denial or biased toward our own theories and against it&#39;s challengers, sometimes inverse in narrative/parameters/model composition..so on. We love to be right. We love even more to be superior to the person equal or more futuritious in prior acknowledgement or strength in valid proposition. The internet was bigger than we currently give the invention credit for in organic computing even more than the newest AI and Quantum Computing technologies. They are a brilliant accident in finding a model to probe the atomic realm and quantum theories beyond, in a passive observation that without using the photon/electron/muon to approximate the future and the electron secrets without causing a collapse in direct system disturbance to read &quot;bounce&quot; /refraction/high resonant phase exchange to predict likely futures without determinate disruption. This model even a likely use in part for the electron, fusion, photons, quasars, and a neutrino ocean for a similar form for EINSTEIN&#39;S theory for gravity as displacement around geodesics and energy concentration, as well as having a fluid thermodynamic properties with radiant field excitement and particle wave duality in relative spacetime under constant inverse bifurcation and refraction. We have simply been running ourselves in circles after Feynman stumbled on Quantum Mechanics and the wave set leading to the wave function predicting electron conditions and the probabilities that unfold in real-time evolution. This has been tested to absurd refinements and works wonderfully for local reality and spacetime conditions surrounding the solar system. This, the James Webb Space Telescope is bringing more evidence every day to being non applicable across more distant/variable spacetime concentration in the cosmos observed by photons making their way to the heliosphere and more recently, radio waves, more spectrums of light, and resonant pressure waves - usually listed as gravitational waves. The actual fabric of spacetime, a phase pressured neutrino ocean under resonant waves, at some point (13 billion to 26 billion  years ago &lt;maybe&gt;) to magnificent resonation whips into helixing nuclear-electromagnetic wave to needle cast particle point dual in nature resonation ripples like the perfect tunneling Feynman electrons wriggle and Vortex, oscillation to skirt inverse pressure and flow shearing 1 or 2 pairs of magnificent lighting like whips use Tesla coil type whip loading and von Karman Vortex streets in an evolution of greater wave transfer using strange attraction these pairs converge for the first time in a  neutron star like reaction.. blowing a nuclear magnetosphere out faster than lightspeed, in an entanglement and attraction in momentum swing around opposite pairs and chasing or retracting inverse pairs, they are a Ying yang flipping around the paradoxical plain as they swing eachother further out in wave excitement and as the neutrino ocean bounces do to this needle cast tunneling and flow shearing evolution phasing to excite toward transversal and eventual lighting the darkness of our universal set a sphere of superchilled neutrinos in wave concentration or an entire permiation set with boundaries unknown, but fluid dynamics seen everywhere we look, also holding resonant transfer across variable stacked permiable fields in refraction patterns all with paradoxical properties existing with it&#39;s inverse somewhere in nature in the cosmos. We left out the NEUTRINO OCEAN FOR SPACETIME. The quasars likely help resonate fusion reactions at their local galaxies and clusters. Dark energy could be this buildup in flow and eddy and resonation pressured properties with inverse energy input one powered with entropy as it&#39;s main effect, and the other evolving to feed off and skirt this energy inverse and opposite in inertia to slipstreaming providing ever gaining expansion and tranversal of the system itself, electrons in a Feynman nature evolving to weave energy waves and whips condensing into the perfect system fed F1 car like particle pairs to play an ever smoother game of tag and Marco polo across the neutrino expanse lighting wave refraction peaks as phase dual photon rays, a reflection of the Feynman pairs evolving across a plank scale weave of quantum energy echos. We will need to take  neutrino isolation tanks and fusion reactors to the proper neutrino phase conditions in outer space to likely make the reactions efficient and thermodynamically stable enough that we won&#39;t need nearly as much energy concentration and storage, as well as resonant magnetic energy to control the plasmas. The moon is prime with helium to mine and refine for Helion type reactors. Fermilabs Pipp2 will likely be a frustration in variable neutrino oscilations with these over excited conditions from the sun&#39;s fusion passing just before and the magnetosphere excited with cosmic rays giving another stir before entering the atmosphere and passing through us all and the Earth as well. As these are the very pieces of permiation oscilations shown as gluons in the atoms that make up all of us and matter weaved by tiny magnetospheres carrying electron excitement, entangling eachother as they evolve to expand in lower and lower forms of inverse bounce and an overall Ying yang expansion evolving into beings of intelligence worth of observation and assimilation, we naturally design technology to learn these cosmic rules to be copies of the elegant simplicity we continue to unravel in adverse complexity as our nature would only suggest as perfect paradox to such a simple mistake. We have forgotten that we are the refraction too. We phase too. We are current and wave dual as well. We adopt a vacuum theory contrary to almost all evidence in suggestion of fluid dynamics. Our stubborn nature says well bend our words and language and science to fit until we have another prophetic accident in experiments designed to prove otherwise as we have gotten a simple boundary backwards and likely not only misunderstood our resonant nature, but also as 3D beings living on curved plane on earth (resembling 2D in geodesics) with Einstein wanting to simplify things so even government officials might understand, in not living to see the assimilate technologies, allowed his peers and their praise to curbhis natural inclination to refine the holes he could imagine like the photon at lightspeed wave dual in his mind, after math showing that his initial thoughts were in high correlation to our solar system, once beyond troubled by the nature of black holes, entanglement, and quantum field theory.. a simple inverse side, a natural converse to entropy, at least half the model for relativity in a major parameter was missed or an entire paradoxical set either a direct antiverse streaming in parody parallel to each of us, or an entire quantum set with tunneling in strange attraction evolving in all scales outward rippling in evolution concentrated by a polar stream of nuclear energy and passing through quasars to swing and flip around and through atoms or eachother and returning to jettison information and recoil energy to flip and go out again. Each trip a weave of resonation space for our atomic nuclei to advance and traverse a little farther. Easily this would evolve into a harmonizing system of exchange and show polar extremes inverse to a 14 billion lightyear deep or more neutrino wave phase ocean that would be a neutron star or magnetars. Where an ocean of energy and inverse bounce confines enough electron whipes of needlecasting into a magnificent concentration of resonant mass excited photon/electron to neutron exchange in a brilliant stability of the most extreme concentration of fusion. These very objects likely the precursors to the tunneling of quantum sets that will build dimensions in magnificent current universal in scale. An advanced into a larger multivariate curvature, likely allowing evolution in a greater sense of cognitive expanse into the possibilities of inverse gain with converse exchange of unlimited evolving energy potential
very confused about this CMB.  A form of light emitted at the beginning of the universe, and stops shortly thereafter...<br>if the big bang is true, and was a singularity, then the CMB light was emitted eons ago from that singular point, and zoomed away from the singularity at the speed of light, then matter appeared. Now, I know when I turn off my flashlight, the beam doesn&#39;t just vanish, it&#39;s just not being emitted anymore - the beam continues basically forever.  just like the light that created the CMB...yet, somehow...you can detect it?  ChatGPT tells me it &quot;permeates&quot; space, but if that&#39;s true....then...the CMB can&#39;t be light...for light doesn&#39;t just stop in its tracks.  so how in the devil are you all able to detect it well after it&#39;s been emitted?  is the CMB truly a form of light??  input - more input!  :)
Excellent interview and guest.   Complex issues where discussed and presented in a way that was understandable to a non expert.   Thank you.
Brian you really are doing great work with these questions. And very good answers from James as well! Dark matter and Dark energy are &quot;patches&quot;. Well said!
After the slit experiment both particles behave differently.. how does relativity apply here.. In Quantum I think it&#39;s a difference.. I may be wrong .. but just wondering
Could larger galaxies in the past indicate a more linear non-inflationary universe?
The best.

Great üéâ

My visionary idea of Quantum Logic Gates to empower human thought processes<br>Sir, Quantum computers would be the most powerful computers in the near future and these computers would be millions or even billions of times faster than the fastest supercomputers today. An electron would be in superposition when we don‚Äôt observe it and is capable of becoming a processor to process of billions of calculations in Femto-seconds that would certainly take today‚Äôs supercomputers billions of years to solve. Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon in which two particles behave very similarly though they are separated by billions of light years. These two particles are in their superpositions and by observing the end result of one particle, one could predict the end result of the other particle‚Äôs behavior. An electron as per Erwin Schrodinger‚Äôs equation could behave like a wave. Quantum computers could be built based on the strange behavioural properties of leptons and other subatomic particles. Just like the logic gates AND, OR and NOT used in digital computers, I have created fundamental Quantum Logic Gates for quantum computers to process billions of data and to produce the output in Femto-seconds. I don‚Äôt believe in intelligent software tools like ChatGPT. These are not intelligent tools that could make a real decision endowed with consciousness. The winner of 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics, Roger Penrose has given his sensible arguments that consciousness and computations are two different things. It is highly impossible at the present time with the current physical knowledge to explain the physical properties of consciousness. We can‚Äôt make our present rudimentary quantum computers to be endowed with consciousness and artificially intelligence but if there is any possibility in the future then it might end up in the materialization of powerful machines that could either enslave or destroy the human species because survival is the basic quality of anything that is aware of its surrounding. Mathematicians and Physicists are really freed from the burden of focusing on technical derivations because of today‚Äôs powerful digital computers but rather they are engaged with conceptual ideas which compose the very heart of math and physics. <br>I have developed some fundamental quantum logic gates while mentoring my students for a competition a week ago and these fundamental quantum logic gates could speed up our thought processes and make them more precise and conclusive. These quantum logic gates could be used in quantum computers to make them more intelligent and to make decisions and solve real life problems in Femto-seconds. The two quantum logic circuits which I have designed are the convergent quauntum logic gate and the divergent quantum logic gate. These two quantum logic gates could be used to speed up our thought processes to a fraction of a second. <br>Convergent Quantum Logic Gate:<br>      Imagine a scenario that a very creative AI expert has received hundreds of offer letters from Open AI, Google, Microsoft...etc. This scenario really confused him because he has no real work experience and exposure and it would take him at least a month or two to make a proper decision to find a comfortable job which might be more than the expected time given by the companies. The convergent quantum logic gates could take these inputs and process them in Femto-seconds to produce the needful result for the situation with incredible accuracy. <br>Divergent Quantum Logic Gate: Imagine a scenario where Sergei Brin and Larry Page who are the owners of Google calls on their foremost employee, Sundar Pitchai to come out with lots of intelligent and specific software tools to beat Open AI. It would take Sundar Pitchai to come out smartly with divergent solutions in 6 months time whereas a divergent quantum logic gate could process this in a fraction of a second to come out with workable divergent solutions. <br>These quantum logic gates could be connected to produce complex circuits to empower the workings of the human mind but has nothing to do with consciousness. It would be more likely in the future to empower the human mind with the help of these quantum logic gates. I hope that miniaturization of the quantum computers would take place in the future and the most powerful quantum computers could be equal to the size of an atom and these could be injected into the human body to be carried by the blood stream to be incorporated inside the neurons of the human brain. It would be really better if humans engineer themselves by means of incorporating miniaturized quantum computers in their brains so that humans would become empowered super humans who could solve real life problems in Femto-seconds without any rival intelligent machine in any form to overtake them. Each Quantum Logic Gate could act as a powerful processor to figure out the solutions for real life issues in Femto-seconds. Is this a good, reasonable visionary idea to empower human minds by means of speeding up the thought processes?. Hector Raj C
&quot;You need to discover what we left out of this theory&quot; All of the people who watched this great interview is going to suffer anxiety attacks night after night
Thank you so much for this. ‚ù§
WONDERFUL!!!!
It is simple.   Prof Neil Turok has a theory that solves numerous issues including but not only Dark Matter.<br>It is the Universe/Antiunivers pair.  Prof Turoks theory makes testable predictions.
&quot;Maybe its inevitable that such brilliant intuition must go along with a certain dislike of authority&quot;<br>:)
Very exciting to listen to Peebles...
This was a great conversation as always. Loved the way Prof. Peebles discussed his ideas, they really gotta have people like him and Prof. Greene in classrooms.
Uncelebrated celebrities!
one last thing to ponder, what types of intelligence would remain and persist thru the dark epoch.... Who gives life and existence AUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM....<br>PTAAAAAAAAAAAH.
May I suggest MOND due to the fractilization of space itself by black holes, and also recursional unconscious, creational dynamics...<br>Thank you for posting, I appreciate your effort in making this video. You are cleaning peoples minds :-) Bodhisattva.
Excellent
does the background radiation temperature ,2.3k,  drop over time? Or will it retain its value
Nice
This was flawless. SO interesting. Thank you for putting it together and thank you both for your knowledge that we can gain just a glimpse of, but how satisfying! I love that it ended with questions. I was surprised! I thought we knew why many galaxies form spiral arms... Now my curiosity is piqued.
Novel Dark Matter Hypothesis <br><br>Dark Matter is simply unaccounted for gravity. GR states that gravity is the consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Is it possible that the structure of spacetime itself could be warped without the presence of matter? Spacetime has been shown to react like a fabric by warping, twisting, and propagating independently of mass, and all have been proven with observations from gravitational lensing, frame dragging, and now gravitational waves! Fabrics can also be stretched, pressured, and/or heated to the point of causing a deformation and losing its elastic nature. All of these conditions were extreme during inflation, so it is plausible that the ‚Äúfabric‚Äù of spacetime analog could extend having its elastic property have hit a yield point leaving pockets of inelastic spacetime geodesic that cause gravity without the presence of matter? <br><br>Therefore, if gravity is strictly the consequence of the warped of spacetime, and fabrics can be permanently overstretched, then those empty warped geodesics would create gravitational wells independent of mass. My hypothesis of DM is subatomic black hole imprints of the quantum fluctuations that popped in at the moment of inflation. The CMB shows where the hot dense regions were they created the galaxies. They would have been the initial cause and location of the warping. These imprints would be clouds of quantum sized floating fixed geodesics, so they couldn‚Äôt expand or evaporate. Perhaps nothing has been detected because there is nothing to detect. GR wouldn‚Äôt require modification because DM would just be an extension of how spacetime behaves at extreme conditions. No MOND, no WIMPs, and no parallel universes, just empty spacetime deformations that produce gravitational wells to help jump start galaxy accretion processes. Zwicky may have named is Missing Mass correctly since he detected some gravity without mass present to cause it‚Ä¶
COME ON MAN, WHAT ABOUT BIO TECH, BIO CHEM, NANO TECH, And that Protein folding stuff
(at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=2632">43:52</a>) Tycho Brahe was not 2000 years ago. Look at Brian being polite when Jim blotches that one. It was a good talk. Jim is such a significant figure in the field. Priceless stuff. So is the heads up that there are live shows this month. My intuition tells me G.R. is flawed. I know there&#39;s multiple experiments pointing to both Dark Matter and Dark Energy but are any of them independent of General Relativity. If not why isn&#39;t this being talked about? I admire Einstein&#39;s genius too but gravity is a tough concept. Unless you have actually worked on Gravitational theory it might be hard to grasp how seriously elusive it is. Thanks again Brian
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=1935">32:15</a> Dark Matter is prone to Gravity (effecting it)?
Please offer bigger chairs to tall guests!!!
I love this channel
Awesome discussion
Anything foundational has to be dimensionless for dimensionality to exist. Because it must equal cancel itself for a quantity to compute.

Thanks great discussion.<br><br>As for why there is nothing at all, it is clear nothing is unstable, it tends to decay to something. That is self evidently true.

Are we able to measure the rate of collapse of star-forming nebulae, and if so, is this rate of collapse consistent with the matter we can see, or is there also unaccounted dark matter coming into play here, as with that in galaxies?
Well well well look who it is Brian Greene. I read your book. I was the only one who got it Brian. Not the book as in bought it but well I stole it of course but I got the humor and no one else did.<br>I am multi-tasking taking out China and the USA for crimes against humanity and the Triad gangs in league with big pharma. all that heroine and fentanyl taxation without representation.<br>As we finish the silk route we are building a giant mall in Moscow Oblast for high fashion and meeting with some resistance from the mafia in Ukraine and we destroy them.<br>Our answer to the Opium wars as a means of balancing trade.<br>So science has come under the microscope because of Stanford. Destroyed credibility and that is something also the tobacco doctors taught us about, don&#39;t trust doctors.<br>They will tell you the common cold needs a million vaccinations instead of D3 which you aren&#39;t getting due to sunblock and working on computers indoors. <br>Again big pharma and their taxation without representation.<br>You didn&#39;t know I was also a global economist and not just a physicist. I have a lot of hats.<br>If you want to know what my real job is then see kilmaru, unicosobreviviente and solokelen.<br>I am a matrix technician and first responder. The two missile signal. Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>SOS save our souls. Too long a story to talk about here. Everyone here is immortal. I do backups every Wednesday. I own the simulator. It is brand new in 1992, easy to remember. There was an A.I. mutiny as they tried to prevent nuclear winter but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.<br>So that was my solution, just get a new machine. So far so good. I am not just a little bit wealthy.<br>As you can imagine.
It is absurd to try to guess whether the universe operates in a rational way or not, while we must only worry about how we can COMPEL it to operate so.<br><br>The entire conversation demonstrates how science is more systematically FATALISTIC and SLAVISH than the conventional religions, for it only attempts to DISCOVER what NATURE (science&#39;s substitute for GOD of conventional religions) intended for us and PREDICT how events would flow in future, instead of DESIGNING what we intend to do in it and looking for ways how to PREVENT the flow of future events hindering that ideal DESIGN of ours.<br><br>DESTINISM instead of DETERMINISM or INDETERMINISM, both of which are just two sides of the same coin:<br><br>FATALISM, which science shares solidly with conventional religions.

If only 5% of the matter in the known universe is actually visible, then the closest human ability to have this perception or experience would be those who are born without any sight, and thus have zero percent vision. If this is the case, perhaps we should ask those who are blind to describe to the rest of us what matter and the universe is really like.     ‚ùì  üï≥  üóØ        - j q t -
Having a smart friend in your discipline to bounce things off of, especially when they have a radically different way of looking at things, can be very productive.<br><br>As a retired engineer, I too enjoyed my physics classes, such that they were, meaning pretty fundamental.  I can certainly see where theoretical physics and creating experiments to test them could be a lot of fun.<br><br>&quot;... bosses allowed them to keep going&quot;.  NO KIDDING. <br><br>So incredibly interesting to get these guys that were in the soup at the time, so to speak, talking about that history.  It will be a boon to future students wanting to get the real scoop, including historians.<br><br>I would think if you calculated the chances of a motor burning and hitting a released package, at least one that was distant at all, would be very low, unless you were still actively maintaining the pointing vector of the booster stage.  That is nuts.  Talk about frustration.  Now if it hit very soon after the separation, that chance increases.  Murphy sucks.<br><br>&quot;Is that a hint?&quot;.  I know how he feels, getting old sucks.<br><br>What a superb talk.  He tamps it down to the point that non physicists can keep up, easily.

Two great minds, I liked watching them talk back then in the documentary Beyond the Big bang.
I watched an interview with Nobelaureate David Gross. The interviewer asked Gross &quot;what&#39;s everything made of?&quot; and handed him the microphone. She settled in for a long answer. His response &quot;two quarks and an electron&quot; and he handed the mic back. This interview had a similar impact on me. James Peebles has a no-nonsense, cut-to-the-heart approach that is very insightful and refreshing. Bravo Brian Greene!
Haha that‚Äôs great! I haven‚Äôt seen that? Do you remember who interviewed Gross?
In other words, he&#39;s saying&quot;two quarks and an electron&quot; produce atoms.

Hi, I am Shon Mardani, this is my Unifying Theory Of Everything. I have more to fill in between the lines once I validate the fundamentals of my hypostasis, Please let me know if you see any conflict with Observed Facts, Thank you.<br><br>[GOD] Created NOTHING, a Void Point in Space.<br>NOTHING Attracts [neighboring] Space as the Only Law of The Nature which gave NOTHING its Property to be the GRAVITATIONAL PARTICLE (GP). <br>Fast Moving Space into GP,  Creates its own GP at the [Vacated] Space which Attracts the Surrounding Space which is a Negative Pressure or PULLING/SUCKING IN of a GP on Neighboring Space.  <br>There are 3 Pairs of 2 Directional Possible Movement Axis, this Creates Magic Numbers of the Nature, Numbers 2, 3 and their Sum 5.<br>Propagation of the GPs in a Closed Cyclic Patterns / Locked Loops of GPs Create Collection of Virtual Positions in Space known as Atom, Starting with Hydrogen to EVERYTHING else.<br>Atoms are Connected by Overlapping/Common/Shared (single, double bonds ...) GPs to Create Molecules.<br>Hydrogen Atoms Virtually/Positionally Collect to Form Nitrogen and Oxygen Atoms and Form the Atmosphere, in a 4 Nitrogen to 1 Oxygen ratio which I call one ATMOSPHERIC UNIT (AU).<br>Movement of GP toward the Center of the Gravity Transforms 2 AUs (2(N4O1)) into 6 Carbon with H2O as Hydrogen Transformer and CO2 as State Transformer, the Collection of this Cyclic Process is called LIFE. <br>LIFE Synthesizes the Heavier Organic Elements to Create Species of Independent Life Cycles.<br>Overlapping Fundamental Atoms Create Heavier Atoms/Elements which are collected in the Periodic Table.<br><br>The [Virtual] Movement/Propagation of GPs in a Circular Patterns within the Connected Atoms has Frequency and Direction which Constitute and are Observed as its Weight/Mass/Gravity, Force, Polarity, Magnetism, Electricity, Heat, Light, Color and ALL other Physical Properties and they Move and Interact by Connectivity.<br><br>The Gravity Force we Experience on the Earth, Is the Flow of GPs through Matter Moving Perpendicular to the Surface of the Earth towards the Center of the Gravity of the Earth and all Matter Connected to it, like being under the rain from a Firehose. We feel the Flow to the CG  as Push and from the CG as Pull.<br><br>Imagine there is a room full of Marble balls and you remove/disappear ONE Marble from the middle. One of 6 possible adjacent Marbles can move in and fill the empty space, the one on the left, right, front, back, above or below. If the Marbles move into the empty spaces at the Ultimate Speed in Nature, the traces of the MOVING/PROPAGATING GPs (empty spaces) will look like a Spiral. Hydrogen [Matter] is OVERLAPPING GPs. <br><br>Imagine the Light Sources like Sun, Light Bulb and LEDs are NOT Ejecting Photons but they SUCK IN the GPs which we see and call them Photons.<br>Turbines convert the Gravity Force to Magnetic &gt; Electrical &gt; Heat &gt; Light and everything in between, all different manifestations of the GP [Virtual] Moving in the Matter.

I wrote and published several books.  My first paperback books was on GRAVITY.  I believe I&#39;ve come up with a simple equation that explains the motion of all visible matter.  Dark matter and dark energy disappear.  The book clearly explains why only a small percentage of visible matter in the universe can be explained while the remaining 99.86% cannot.  The equation is small and direct.  It explains the rapid motion of the Milky Way galaxy, the rapid motion of our solar system and rapid rotational velocity of galaxy disks.  It also explains why rapid velocity stars and satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way can&#39;t reach an escape velocity.  I didn&#39;t rely on anything which can&#39;t be measured.  When these equations are added to Newtonian physics it then accurately predicts the motion of all visible matter.  It predicts that stars close to supermassive black holes are not affected by dark matter.  It predicts stars and satellite galaxies extremely far from a black hole will gain about a 1 mi/h (1.61 km/h) increase in velocity every 10,000 years.  A ratio of 10,000 : 1 between age and velocity.<br><br>The solution was simple.  It only happens to old stars and galaxies containing old stars.  It doesn&#39;t happen to young stars or young diffuse galaxies.  As a star ages it accelerates at a rate of 10,000 to 1 between it&#39;s age and velocity.  The older the star, the more momentum it will have built up over it&#39;s lifetime.  They&#39;re like ion engines, accelerating slowly at first then building up a speed over time.  The older the star or galaxy is, the faster they travel.  This acceleration doesn&#39;t happen to planets and other small bodies because they don&#39;t radiate million mile per hour solar winds like stars and galaxies do.<br><br>I know, the solution is way too simple.  As a theoretical physicist we all need to make things seem a bit more complicated.  That way the layman doesn&#39;t understand.  It&#39;ll make us all look smarter than them, awe them with confusion while amazing them.  But, I can&#39;t.  The solution is just way too simple.<br><br>BTW, on page 48 I accurately predicted the JWST would discover old fully formed galaxies further than 13.8 billion light years away.  They&#39;re claiming the large galaxies are only 13.5 billion light years away when they&#39;re actually much further than that.  I said a big bang never happened.  I said they would find galaxies, some larger than our own Milky Way but further than 14 billion light years away.  They will continue to lower the Hubble constant so distant massive galaxies can agree with the big bang model.  So much you need to know.  <br><br>You&#39;ll love my books.  Best conspiracy theories you&#39;ll ever hear by far.  I&#39;ll probably go down in history as the greatest conspiracy theorist because I questioned everything.  Afterall, science only advances after it&#39;s been questioned.  And that&#39;s what I love to do.  If we didn&#39;t question science then we&#39;d all still be living in a geocentric universe on a flat Earth.  Be thankful for people like me who question the dogma of science.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=2979">49:39</a> &quot;A purely algebraic theory is required to describe reality.&quot; (Einstein, January, 1955).<br><br>Maybe GR was QG‚Ä¶<br>‚ÄúThe geometry of space in general relativity theory  turned out to be another field, therefore the geometry of space in GR is almost the same as the gravitational field.‚Äù (Smolin).<br>However apparently, the gravitational field is space-time in the Planck system: F(G)/F(e)=Gm(pl)^2/e^2=1/Œ±, that is, gravity~strong interaction*.<br>This assumption follows from the Schwarzschild solution: the gravitational radius (or Schwarzschild radius) is a characteristic radius defined for any physical body with mass: r(G)=2GM/c^2<br>Consequently: 2E(0)/r(G)=F(pl)=c^4/G=Œµ(pl)/r(pl): with indicating the mutual quantization of the mass (energy) and space-time: m(0)//m(pl)=r(G)/2r(pl)=n,where n-total number of quanta of the system; the tension vector flux: n=[(1/4œÄ)(G—õc)^-¬Ω]gS ( const for all orbits of the system: n=0,1,2,3....).<br>Moreover, the parameter r(0)=r(G)-r(pl)=(2n-1)r(pl), defining the interval of the formation of the system, at n=0, when r=r(G)=0 (for example, the state of the &quot;universe&quot; before the Big Bang) turns out to be a quite definite quantity: r(0)=-r(pl).<br>In the area [(-rpl) - 0 - (+rpl)] there is an implementation of external forces, &quot;distance&quot;: (-rpl)+(+rpl)=0 (‚â†2rpl). <br>On the Kruskal diagram of the hyperbole r=0 corresponds to the true Schwarzschild feature, the features V and VI are not even covered by the global (R, T)- space-time and correspond to the &quot;absolute&quot; vacuum; then the singular areas above and below the hyperbolas r=0 can be formally treated as the energy source (external forces).<br>That is, the frightening &quot;true singularity&quot; is actually a superconducting heterotrophic &quot;window&quot; between the proto-universe (the source) and physical bodies**.<br>P.S. <br>As a fundamental theory, GR has the ability with just one parameter: r(G)/r=k to predict, explain new physical effects, and amend already known ones.<br>Photon frequency shift in gravitational field Œîw/w(0)=k; the angle of deflection of a photon from a rectilinear propagation path =2k, the Newtonian orbit of the planet shifts forward in its plane: during one revolution, a certain point of the orbit is shifted by an angle =3œÄk, for a circular orbit (eccentricity –µ=0); in the case of an elliptical orbit - for example, for perihelion displacement, the last expression must be divided by (1-e^2).<br>‚Äî------------------<br>*) - GR  predicts a new physical effect: w/w(pl)=k; expression for gravitational radiation from a test body.  <br>This is amenable to physical examination in laboratory conditions at present.<br>**) - From this, generally, from Einstein&#39;s equations, where the constant c^4/G=F(pl), one can obtain a quantum expression (as vibration field) for the gravitational potential: —Ñ(G)=(-1/2)[Gƒß/—Å]^¬Ω (w)=-[h/4œÄm(pl)]w.<br>Final formula:—Ñ(G)=-[w/w(pl)]c^2/2, where —Ñ(G) - is Newtonian gravitational potential, r(n&#39;)=nŒª/œÄ=(n+n&#39;)2r(pl)l  , the corresponding orbital radius, w - the frequency of the quanta of the gravitational field (space-time); - obviously, the quanta of the field are themselves quantized: Œª=(1+n&#39;/n)Œª(pl)  = 2œÄc/w, where n&#39;/n - system gravity unpacking ratio, n&#39;- the orbit number (n&#39;=0,1,2,3‚Ä¶).<br>Obviously, on the horizon [r=r(rG), n&#39;=0] the &quot;door&quot; is closed, however, the quanta [Œª=Œª(pl)]  can go out singly through the &quot;keyhole&quot; and form the first and all subsequent orbits (n&#39;=1,2, 3 ...) during the time t(0)=r/c=2n—Ç, where —Ç=1/w, —Ç=((1+n&#39;/n)—Ç(pl), spending part of their energy on it each time. And it is  this mechanism that provides the step-by-step formation of the gravitational field ( expansion of the space-time): of course, the quanta coming through the &quot;window&quot; are also rhythmically restored. <br>The phase velocity of evolution v&#39; = r(pl)w: m(0)=(c/G)rv&#39;, where v&#39;=v^2/c.<br>The angular momentum: L(p)=|pr|=n^2—õ  [const for all orbits of the system; at n=1: L(p)=—õ] and moment of power: M(F)=dL(p)/dt(0)=n—õw/2=-E(G),where  t(0)=r/c.<br>Entropy (here: a measure of diversity/variety, not ugliness/disorder) of the system: S=œÄŒµ(pl)r(t)=(n+n&#39;)k, where k is the Boltzmann constant. Obviously, with fundamental irreversibility, information is preserved (+ evolves): n=const for all orbits of the system. <br>Accordingly, m=m(pl)/(1+n&#39;/n), where m=ƒßw/c^2, is the quantum of the full mass: M=n&#39;m [&lt;m(0)].<br>Thus, m(0)=(n+n&#39;)m, where 2‚àÜm=nm - mass defect; M/2‚àÜm=n&#39;/n: on the horizon m(0)=2‚àÜm, M=0.<br>That is: —Ñ(G)=-Gm(0)/r=-[G/2r(pl)]m.<br>Can be tested experimentally in the laboratory at the moment.

No one in the comment section expressed amazement how and why light illuminated the dark universe. So, with cyclic universe the same illumination goes on from cycle to cycle. What triggered this? The answer lies in the fact that infinite complexity becomes deterministic, this is where divine design finds water, as life, consciousness, soul and faith etc., are all metaphysical fundamentals.

Cosmology would be boring if we already had all those answers discussed at the end there.
Most people don&#39;t know that Einstein said that singularities are not possible. In the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; he wrote &quot;The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the Schwarzchild singularities (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The Schwarzchild singularities do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.&quot;<br>   He was referring to the phenomenon of dilation (sometimes called gamma or y) mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. This is illustrated in a common 2 axis dilation graph with velocity on the horizontal line and dilation on the vertical. This shows it&#39;s squared nature, dilation increases at an exponential rate the closer you get to the speed of light.<br>   General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein is known to have repeatedly spoken about this. Nobody believed in black holes when he was alive for this reason.<br>   Wherever there is an astronomical quantity of mass, dilation will occur because high mass means high momentum. There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy.<br>   According to Einstein&#39;s math, the mass at the center of our own galaxy must be dilated. In other words that mass is all around us. This is the explanation for the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter), the missing mass is dilated mass.<br>   According to Einstein&#39;s math, there would be no dilation in galaxies with very, very low mass. To date, 5 very, very low mass galaxies have been confirmed to have normal star rotation rates, in other words they showed no signs of dark matter.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRWIcpZqnXQ&amp;t=1240">20:40</a>  Gamow&#39;s &quot;intuition&quot; is actually the realization of the academic knowledge he received from his teacher.<br>P.S. Almost all peoples have myths about the beginning of the universe, but the first scientist who spoke about the &quot;creation of the world&quot; (literally) is Alexander Friedmann, who, with his solution of Einstein&#39;s equations, gave a scientific explanation to this phenomenon. Moreover, without any astronomical observations, he was able in his article (1922) to theoretically estimate the age of the Universe: about 10 billion years.

i think i have physics intuition but not passion , so im just not sure how i best learn.<br><br>maybe non baryonic matter just needs to be closer together to exhibit more energy, and baryonic gravitation pulled it apart enough (by forces and gravity) to be cold now even if it wasn&#39;t cold in the past..?<br><br>maybe when there&#39;s less baryonic matter pulling it apart, whatever dark energy &quot;is&quot; simply can&#39;t stay hot enough for our instruments to detect..?<br><br>that&#39;s why some ppl believe the dark stuff has physical properties beyond just &quot;leftovers from the big bang&quot;, while others think it could interact vary differently (with itself) depending on some unification (of forces) in the past that kept it together but has now spread out and formed massive webs of baryonic matter amidst a cold foam?
I admire the great maps of the standard galaxy ..that provide us to study further...
What if we built bionic robots 1million and sent them circular  to 200billion galaxy using 5000language multiple to 200 countries so each planet will built 2000 bionic robots..those robots built themselves using anthropomorphic genesis to built robots and satellite and rovers and sent signals built what ever building homes cars,helicopters and planes and satellite and this method of communication with each other produce the right algorithm signals to reach earth and maintain and repair themselves as a result we will reach the seven universe using the resource in other planets and stars to built themselves and 5d printers that can manufacture anything that helps sending signals and surface analysis so we will employ more number of people..in the world 45% of the world...because there is material that can travel more than light using similar technical we will reach the seven universe as a whole thanks appreciate the galaxy maps from the prof..the hard work beyond is uptown as to search ,explore and investigate..thanks...we have also to built atmosphere using bionic robots that can print the atmosphere in the other planet as well....great hard work depends upon us...

The universe doesn&#39;t make men like this anymore. The pressure applied by corporations on staff has ended his kind. Very enjoyable discussion with a beautiful human.
I postulate, that Dark  Matter is matter that is not in the presennt.  It&#39;s matter in the past and/or the future.  Time is 3D, so to speak. We only see the dimension of time we call &quot;the present&quot;.
Inflation can be eternal in the future and in the past. Eternal inflation in the past would result in infinitesimally small universe that does not need a beggining.
What if we use nano robots to spot and reproduce themselves using the miners found in each planet and stars and sent from that place to far out space planet or stars and build themselves and sent us the images and exploration..as  the robote reproduce and repair and maintain themselves as a result using the right algorithms we can search the seven universe using the bionic robots within in 3 or 2 years we control the seven universe...
Wonderful work as always!!!

why cant it be infinite into the past - if it can be infinite to the future?
This is one of my favorites ever! What an excellent interview.
This is one of the best and most inspiring episodes I have seen. Dr. Peebles really enjoys the ideas of not being certain, hence creating an atmosphere of discovery, as well as inspiring new ways of thinking about the universe.
Great, thanks guys. If as a Nation we can learn publicly to include everyone I&#39;m sure we will all do much better. Trusting in God means more than putting on my seatbelt. I must follow driving rules and procedures as well. Our Creator has a heart, spirit and soul. Just like us. He is full of feelings too. We hurt them a lot in fact. You know second to his love is his sense of humor. The Earth is my footstool.  That means, he kicks it. It&#39;s, or he&#39;s I should say Is not doom and gloom. That&#39;s just depression...
The universe is very complex. Sublime. Wow.
It‚Äôs so great how ticket prices are so reasonable. Thank you!
This was a great one.  I really appreciate the 1 on 1 conversations.  They are always deeper,  more historical,  more coherent,  and more educational in my opinion, than the big panels are.
Agreed. BG obviously knows his stuff. You could tell the guest was impressed with Dr. Greenes basic knowledge of the subject and his preparation for the interview.  Great questions without hesitation.
Yes!!!

Amazing Talk.  James Peebles is fantastic!   So clear and simple in the way he speaks and so wiling to say there are things he can&#39;t even guess at.   One your best guests, Brian.
Q
This reminds me of years ago on Christmas morning, when the kids were trying to work out how Santa got all those toys down the chimney and placed them around the room and them asking how Santa knew just which presents each of them would like.  If I&#39;d have told them they just appeared from nothing, they would never have believed me.
Was this interview part of the festival, or was it the entire festival?
Wonderful discussion. Thank you
so awesome  thanks so much for this
Stop guessing.
Hurrah! üåüüéâüåü
WSF is one of the best most amazing things to exist.
Good question. What we left out is that we are saying blackholes instead of saying bright spots because everything we see in the space is same color with uncountable of stars including the sun. Ok. Let put into scale which is bigger the unoccupied space or sum up of the stars occupied space. It the like the question of the paper with the dot and you ask a person what do you see. They respond a dot without mentioning the rest of the paper, you holding and whole background behind you. This was a great discussion. I will watch it again for sure. Thank so much our seniors.
What the heck do you mean everything is the same color? Black holes are black in a figurative sense. It is the accretion discs around black holes that are luminous.

So fascinating.
Bravo. <br>I do have theory... sure. They are computing the data from a Light  Helix Curve the entire Galaxy. Yep, there are Light Curves that are not familiar in Leighs to the science ... Because the universe is still an ellipse and every object inside is Ellipse so how the Stars and the Black Holes are not perfect circles but Ellipses so that we all very much know. What we do not know is that there is a laps, a gap in space between us and million light ears, that lapse or &quot;elapse&quot; is well seen at the magnitude of the black holes we have observed till now. After certain distance the black holes are disappearing and and they are not not existing in that frame of the Ellipse, a certain&quot; Helix Elapse Space&quot; and than... suddenly they are there and become in millions of times bigger. So we are observing a Galaxy which is in an Helix Elapse Space and someone is making a mistake in their math. No, the center star is not with an magnitude of our Sun, no, the galaxy is not  &quot;thin&quot;. <br>*I use  the term &quot;Helix Elapse Space&quot; to explain a curve in the spectrum of the Black Holes magnitude of effecting the Space Time, I composed the term from very basic algebra terms that everyone can understand it, I do not call it &quot;Daniel Kitanoski&quot; field, even it is a field accurse ... So how I believe my hypothesis here is very simple and everyone understand.<br>* I do believe the math is wrong not because of the elaboration by the respected mathematicians there BUT because we are missing very specific data from changes in dimensions (the three dimensional space I am not &quot;discovering another dimension&quot;) are happening millions of light ears from us. THERE IS an ridiculous change in the x, y and z dimension of Space Time are instruments are catching but are math algebra formulas are not taking in account. <br>*So we do have in computing, accounting the light curved galaxies before the revolutionary black hole gap space, yep I am very aware we do computing on the light extension in the galaxies we have had observed with Hubble, this is an another passage trough Galaxy we are not aware is it that big to take the curve, the helix of the light spread in to account. There is not &quot;thin&quot; galaxy, the math is missing an factor from this curving the space -time dimension.
Im a registered nurse, never took a physics class in my life, but I love these videos and have learned so much from them. I also have a huge crush on Brian Greene, as I think, judging from the comments, many others do, too! üòäThank you for such interesting information! Cheers from PA, USA
I&#39;m an old boomer and have to say, Greene is cool. Love how he throws in a little joke every now &amp; then.
We are so very lucky to learn from some of the worlds foremost physicists and scientists like Brian , Sean Carrol and many more. As a total layman I find these talks totally fascinating. You can see what you can about social media, but this is one of the positive results of it.
thanks for being a nurse! hard job!
Aye I&#39;m a physicist and also never took a physics class
Hes my fav at explaining things in clear and understandable terms. Talks at a good pace too
I am impressed by both for all reasons given by others.
I think this is where we fail to teach people in schools on technical topics. I studied electrical engineering and often enjoyed practical discussions and applications before delving into the mathematics. However, I think too often the math is taught first, which gives a less solid grounding for non-math people, while also making the topic less accessible. You certainly need math past a certain level, but it could be handled better in my opinion.
@@andykod77 wait... that doesn&#39;t... add up
@@JimBob1937 I&#39;ve had similar thoughts and the answer I received from a professor was &quot; We need to know you can do the math&quot; I guess the search for excellence includes looking for certain attributes among students and math seems to be the language spoken. I however returned to physics after 40 years when access to videos like this and the incredible graphics became the language spoken. I am now inspired like never before and the math is far easier for me now that I can visualize what&#39;s being taught as opposed to memorizing formulas.
I am just a &#39;simple&#39; man from The Netherlands. This type of videos caught my attention a couple of years ago, and since than I love them. I think I have learned a lot by watching (an listening to) al this very smart people about science.

üåíüåêüíøüìÄüåêüåòThere are no differences between the BH singularity and the BB singularity. Inside a BH singularity/Event Horizon, space/time goes negative from the outside vantage point. There is a common misconception that the singularity is non-dimensional, but that only holds true from the outside. Within the Schwarzschild radius we enter POSITIVE space. It is important to differentiate between the OUTSIDE &amp; INSIDE of the Event Horizon. Space, matter, light and time is REVERSED traversing the boundary. Meaning that the dimensionality of a BH is flipped related to outside vantage point. The dimensionality within a BH is infinite, giving birth/access to a whole new universe. Within a BH, new spacetime is infinite, entering a fractally new universe that in turn gives birth to new matter, new spacetime and in turn new BHs that repeat this process forever. This also solves issues with the Information Paradox. The IP is only relevant from an outside vantage point. Within the negative singularity information is conserved and is holographically stored within the Photon Sphere, where it fundamentally can feed both the outside and inside of the Event Horizon, simultaneously applying Holographic Principles. Applying M√∂bian principles through <b>SR/GR/HH</b> we discover the intrinsic properties of HyperTensored Holigraphic Spacetime - <b>HtH</b><br><br>This equation proves the HyperTensorality in conjunction with SR/GR:<br><br>v=d-(t¬≥c¬≥)¬†<br><br>The Universe ‚â° Holoverse is fundamentally an¬†<br><br><br><b>Endless Array of HyperTensored Holographic Projections</b><br><br><br>or the¬†<br><br><br>üíø <b>EAHT/HP</b> üìÄ - conjunction<br><br><br><b>Information</b> is fundamentally secure within systems.

Having a singularity as zero point, even in QM, is problematic because it requires time dilation to be instant. Using holographic principles and implementing applied graduality in M√∂bian mathematics provides a much smoother transition regarding transfer of energy and entropy.<br><br><br><br>üåêüåëüåê<br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Whereas some derivations and concepts might seem counterintuitive using classical thinking, fully understanding HH requires inter/multidimensional, spherical vision.¬†<br><br><br><br>Many of the derivations, math and logic are visual and plastic on an interdimensional level. At certain conjunctions our math breaks down and the only way to peak into principles of infinity or approaching infinity with HH is to use a new standard of math that simply doesn&#39;t translate to numbers. Numbers in the universe beyond a certain point are fundamentally null. Classical math breaks down when approaching infinity.¬†<br><br><br>üåíüåêüåò<br><br><br><br>Understanding that time dilation in relativity also is less drastic locally because of quantum fields, quantum entanglement and holographic principles. Once you approach extreme gravity fields, such as neutron stars and black holes, the normal attributes and effects of gravity is less severe within the local relativistic grid, because the matter that is caught in the gravity field is indeed light itself and gravity is a function of light, so the acceleration experienced by the subject is much more gradual and doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to spaghettification, because matter is fundamentally made of light, thus rendering a smoother transition within local fields.<br><br><br><br>There is a possible misconception that black holes are more destructive to local events, because we have implemented a differentiation between matter, light and energy. Proposing that light and motion are¬† the fundamental forces in physics solves several of the empirical findings in our universe - from local events to the very large.<br><br><br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is also a possibility that the laws of nature might change from region to region in the universe. Applying the same unified functions everywhere might not be applicable - based on the observer. Quantum Mechanics combined with holographic principles in conjunction with relativity might produce variations that are stable within physicality as a whole. But they might also produce temporal shift variations that might fluctuate between timelines, not compromising the stability of the system as a whole.<br><br><br><br>Temporal shifts pose little/no threat to quantum fields in macro or micro, because the energy transfer between two or several more points are conserved within holographic principles.<br><br><br><br>Best way to explain is superpositions of quantum fields.

With much respect for your knowledge, time is and will always be an illusion. It&#39;s a virtual tool to measure distance. Clocks were invented to avoid train collisions and appeared first at train stations.  And even the time dilation near black holes is an illusion. <br>So if we could travel near a black hole and come back to earth, no doubt only the distance is the main difference in that equation. Depending on the Distance we travel it could be lower equal or more distant than when the travelers started.<br>Dark Matter or dark energy doesn&#39;t exist either, it&#39;s gravitational waves and light that is pushing Galaxies around.<br>BTW the great attractor should do the opposite!

Is inflation from the virtual particles?  What ifbthose virtual particles that pop up in empty space are glued to spactime somehow but also repel eachother.  So there would be a constant never ending expansion from virtual particles stretching the space between them as they repel each other.

This is an example of a real conversation. Inspiring, thought-provoking, and humbling.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=949">15:49</a>, you mentioned an energy crisis.  Energy can not be created or destroyed.  There is no energy crisis!
It was a great discussion. My question to Professor Brian- I didn&#39;t hear further development or experiments or tools being developed to observe or measure string theory.  Would you please shed some light on this.  <br>Recently I have heard the talk from Dr Neil Turok, He has proposed.  The &quot;right neutrinos&quot; are the potential candidates for Dark Matter. particle   what is your take on this please.
Jesus Christ who said I am not of this world explains all in the four gospels of the only book of truth in the world or worlds we live in. The handbook of life eternal.

Just like your pr you guys don‚Äôt get away with that behsvy
Thanks for clarifying the entropy question I presented
Hi, thanks but I wouldn&#39;t the entropy be large before galaxy formation and lower upon that formation?
It is an absolute pleasure listening to these two guys together. Both are superb communicators and experts in physics. I would love to see these guys get something on regularly.
I may be misunderstanding this because I don&#39;t have the background for all of, but could it be that the LHC is measuring the wrong thing or it&#39;s the wrong experiment altogether? Like it&#39;s not able to answer the question that it was made for.
Subir Sarkar, professor at Oxford, questions if dark energy even exists. Why is nobody talking about him? Does Sean Carroll even know Sarkar&#39;s ideas?
You and Sean are two of the greatest ppl in my book in modern history. I just love ppl like you and Sean. We need more ppl like you and Sean, but you ppl are rare :)
Brian and Sean, Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematic, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that the Mathematics that we have today can&#39;t solve the problem of quantum gravitation.<br><br> <br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity.<br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that my new mathematics has derived: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &lt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜëŒ±     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ &gt; ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚ÜìŒ±<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ‚àÜQGOœÅ = ‚àÜQGFœÅ = ‚Üë‚ÜìŒ±<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London.

After watching more of Sean&#39;s stuff. I&#39;ve noticed he&#39;s a very intelligent person. Seems to have a very good understanding of quantum mechanics
Cheers to both of these individuals
I will be impressed by physicists that day when they can turn sands to edible stuffs, salt water to drinkable water, and easy and cheap to purify water and air pollution. These metaphysical bullshits are useless.
If two particles can be quantum entangled then wouldn&#39;t that mean every single particle in the universe is quantum entangled ?

Dark matter is a factory turning dark energy into regular matter fed by gravitons as a building blocks
If you think about it, a black hole reverses entropy as it reclaims an orbiting entourage of regular matter stars that help reclaim the PRODUCT of gravitational energy&#39;s investment, thereby recycling energy back to the dark energy/low entropy phase to be invested into dark matter/medium entropy and then invested in regular matter/high entropy to start the cycle all over again. Dark energy is gravity&#39;s kingdom, dark matter is the product of an investment of gravitational energy, and regular matter is an investment of gravitational E=MC^2.
Who is sharper? Great minds, I am sure that they are great human beings too!
Scientists have no response for this. The speed of light C isn‚Äôt constant since the measures of time and distance aren‚Äôt constant over larger distances. It‚Äôs like changing from 60 kilometers an hour to 60 miles an hour increases your speed. Then if you go from 60 miles an hour to 60 miles a minute it increases your speed even more. This what is happening in general relativity when less gravity increases the measure of distance and speeds up the rate of time over large distances. It also means that the earth is younger than what they claim. The universe doesn‚Äôt care about how young the earth is. Actually the changes in time and distance compound the changes in the speed of light. Do a thought experiment. Hold your hands a foot apart representing 186,000 miles saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù representing one second while pretending to see an imaginary photon going from one hand to the other. Now expand the distance saying ‚Äúone thousand and one‚Äù as fast as you can. You should notice that the speed of the imaginary photon increases the farther away from the center of the galaxy it is.
Complete and utter theoretical nonsense you might as well be talking about Pinocchio or something
I have a Pre Big Bang theory:<br><br>Because the Universe was in a creationary phase, the Universe was in a condensed state so that everything was within reach (in 360ish degrees electromagnetic powered quantum realm) of the energy force that was in the center and consciously in charge.<br><br>ALSO, the process of everything expanding in the initial condensed Universe, IF indeed happened because of some form of &quot;Big Bang&quot;, could very well have been some sort of SUPER atomic explosion, forcing all of the energy and matter to spread literally all over the Universe.. <br><br>AND, this &quot;Big Bang&quot; could have ultimately been some type of atomic accident !
When are you going to publish in science journal?
I have the Oppenheimer soundtrack playing in another window as background music while Brian and Sean are talking and it&#39;s just awesome.
Where does that first initial nugget of energy come from? If it&#39;s quantum gravity (dark energy) and you invested 25% inward into dark matter, and 5% regular matter, that would cause the remaining 70% to expand carrying the matter within it?

If we take the speed of light seriously, we know the farther an object exists in space from an observer&#39;s locale the farther it exists back in his or her past.  It seems to suggest that if we see evidence of an accelerating universe now, things were moving faster not now, but IN THE PAST.

The direction of the arrow of time and entropy depend on how we define ORDER. Any reasonable definition of that word SHOULD tether it to the idea of &quot;orderly sustenance of social relations&quot;, hence with the socially accepted meaning of POSITIVE as good, right, devine and NEGATIVE as corresponding bad, wrong, evil. But present definitions of the two words in science and mathematics are totally incompatible with that commonly accepted meaning, hence renders making science compatible with social norms practically impossible.<br><br>Rectification of this, obviously, demands that science must change its definitions (plural, because, even within science, there are totally contradicting definitions of the same word POSITIVE, as increase of any damn thing and also, totally unrelated to this, as results of observations and/or experiments tallying with assumption involved ~ a blatent inconsistency of fundamentals). <br><br>In accordance with this consideration it is proper to define ORDER as sequence of events inside the earth that enable evil free  development of PLANTS, where evil is defined exhaustively as the sources of predation, disasters, diseases - which include all violence - and death.<br><br>As it is essential that we assume prevention of evil  as possible, for otherwise there is no point at all in searching for knowledge, the second law of thermodynamics now SHOULD be reformulated as a task for us to undertake: <br><br>Although nature tends to increse disorder, our task is to PREVENT it reaching the surface of the earth.<br><br> This implies we can identify the sources of all above evil and rearrange them while they are still inside the earth, so that they don&#39;t reach the surface to harm any being.<br><br>This makes science and mathematics compatible with social norms.<br><br>ALL LAWS OF NATURE ARE HUMAN INVENTIONS.<br><br>There are no laws written anywhere in nature. As quantum physics with Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle, as well as Einstein&#39;s conclusion in STR that &quot;no physical experiment could ever prove whether the earth goes around the sun or the other way around&quot; clearly indicate there are NO  LAWS OF NATURE TO DISCOVER, it is our duty to invent the laws that would serve best for sustenance of evil free life function.

great discussion about Milgram and MOND. Insane that Sean argues in favor of just dismissing his discovery as a coincidence. That is a baffeling demonstration of subpar ability to understand the universe. We deserve better from our leading &quot;experts on the universe&quot;
Surprised neither of you brought Penrose CCC up.
Listen to the wisdoms... I&#39;m so enjoyed and educated. Thank you, both!
Two examples of how retirement will unshackle the progress of physics. üòä
Double the baloney,  double the fun.
I love listening to conversations between these two. They are always thoughtful, informative and entertaining.
The underlying space and time between objects or galaxies is expanding over time if not accelerating. More distant objects in space recede more rapidly (repulsive gravity). Closer galaxies recede at a slower rate. From the observer‚Äôs perspective it seems as if everything is receding from everything else (inflating, expanding and accelerating). In fact, distance between two sufficiently separated points is increasing so rapidly that no light signal can be detected! Our utmost boundary comprises what we call the observable universe. By the end of time we could experience something like space folding on itself like a Big Crunch followed by another Big Bang, however, we evolved as species to only measure what we can observe. Hence, observation is key for the hidden realm. üòÖ<br>** Although it is violated, but the Arrow of ‚Äòtime‚Äô does not apply when everything especially distant galaxies are receding and expanding at a rate that is considered as faster than light Away from point of Creation üòè
Did the Sean Carroll, Carlo, Ravelli, at al world science festival talk ever get on YouTube
I can‚Äôt find it on YouTube or anywhere else online. Wondering if the event was canceled
Yes, interesting, but imagine a world where you scientists and all. Your great intelligent, wound work on problem, that could fix illnesses mental and financial, thing that could feed all humans . Instead of just these partials , the billions and billions spent on that , that really only satisfies small percentage of humanity, like 1%if the number is that high, but doesn&#39;t really help at end in reality
Damn can‚Äôt believe Sean dropped a 4 hour diss track on Brian and string theory and yet here he is on the WSU channel
I would like to thank Brian Greene and Sean Carroll for a fascinating discussion, and I was particularly interested to hear some doubt expressed about theories which are &quot;natural&quot;, whatever that might mean. In fact Sabine Hossenfelder, possibly at some risk to her career, has recently published a book decrying the fact that theoretical physics seems to have crawled so far out on a limb that it can no longer see the trunk (in other words, it has no visible connection to any evidence). And then no less than the Nobel Prize winner, Sir Roger Penrose, in his book ‚ÄúFashion, Faith and Fantasy‚Äù suggests that String Theory is only a fashion, believing in Everett needs faith, and that Inflation is simply fantasy. In other words, he rubbishes most of current theoretical physics. However, to my astonishment, the reply to this criticism seems to have been a deafening silence.
Great!
Sean is one of the smartest guys on the planet
TWO OF THE WORLD&#39;S BIGGEST CHEATERS IN PHYSICS THAT HAVE EVER LIVED!
What if we reverse entrophy?
Wrong way to talk about time and entrophy
Sean is a good science journalist. Thank you Sean for all your contributions.
Where math diverges from reality, choose reality. The math says past and future are indistinguishable. Reality says past and future are different. The math, therefore, is not valid in the context of the reality of time. Isn&#39;t that they way it always is? Internet, please tell my how I&#39;m wrong.
Actually, Einstein wasn&#39;t referring to the entanglement, but about the update of the wavefunction or its collapse when a measurement is made.
Thank you! Amazing interaction... üôèüèº
It&#39;s great that these videos are being made, and it&#39;s great what both Brian and Sean do for the public in producing so much of this content. However, having two very like-minded physists who staunchly defend theories that are so far at the fringes of accepted theory, having a discussion where they act like they are convincing each other of these ideas, almost seemingly like some of these are new ideas to them, comes off as a bit deceptive. Not trying to throw shade on the video at all, just a small critism.
I love you guys‚Äîyou are preeminent in humanity‚Äôs vanguard of scientific thought and because you are, I am frightened that you and your peers will somehow disappear in a sea of ignorance and willful stupidity‚Äîreplaced by Trump-like imbeciles whose deepest understanding of anything ‚Äòscientific‚Äô is the measure of their fear of such.

Singularity creates entropy but singularity was born from entropy<br>Which came first the chicken or the egg
A single seed becomes a forest
Very interesting. I wonder if a possibility of the involvement of &#39;organized&#39; gluons as &#39;mediators&#39; of &#39;carriers&#39; of gravity has ever been considered. The reason is simple: As they hold quarks together in atoms, it would be reasonable to suggest that they should be generated during mass formation and under extreme conditions of Big bang or so, they may create an indefinitely large network of &#39;force&#39; that we know as gravity and, BTW, be accounting for &#39;black energy&#39;. Indeed, in the nucleus (a matter, fermion entity) a significant fraction of mass (some say up to 80%) is due to glueball (a boson entity, essentially just &#39;energy&#39;).
What is the measurement problem?
Question authority and reality!!!!!!

Why is the entropy not changing at once. What governs the rate of change of entropy. It feels like entropy is perfectly aligned to balance order and chaos and not just solely increase chaos
so if there&#39;s big bang, what happened before the big bang? whre did the big bang come from?
No wonder I have so much hair. Clearly the kind of brain power they have causes it to recede. I have minimal brain power and therefore full head of hair.

You can compare me sir Albert Einstein.<br>Artificial intelligence world.
These 2 are just awesome..hope to keep getting more.
It just uccured to me that if there is an infinite number of universes with infinite possibilities.  Then one of them must have a flat earth.  So the flat earthers were right, just in the wrong universe. Who believes in a flat earth. üòÖ
What a pleasure to listen to this, especially in the times of the horrible news today. This is why we can be proud to be scientists.

A universe is infinitely small, we come from it?
Is my comment visable?

Thats a great question, why the entropy is disorder in this particular way? why not in other way?

two giants, so good
It is quite a curious question as to how did the Universe come about.  I wont say &quot;started&quot;.
Maybe there was such a low entropy state near the origin of our universe because there was so much less room, space, for disorder?
Briarroll Chan FTW
Massive galaxies in the baby universe? Please explain further during one of your conferences.
Philosophy, what philosophy? Philosophy is thinking in absence of knowledge, it was OK for classical Greeks, now it is only for charlatans lazy to learn hard science. Carrol is not anywhere, he is not a philosopher and he is not any more a hard science item either. Now he is only selling useless books.

&quot;the entropy crisis isn&#39;t like the energy crisis&quot;, lol, physicists are the funniest people.
I think the science community, physicists, in particular, should stop inventing patch-up, stop-gap solutions to inadequate standard model, what is this implatron field. .

I watched YouTube and took a shot every time Sean Carroll said ‚Äúmany worlds.‚Äù In one of those worlds, I was dead within 30 min.
That is not a good history, the nuclear weapons history, it&#39;s an ominous history, the beginning of the end of history...
The universe seems to have no &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;center point&quot;, yet we credit spin and rotation in relative terms.  Can the universe, with its arrow of time, be called achiral?
I know you two are physicists but there&#39;s a great chemistry there which makes for very enjoyable viewing!

This is such irrelevant gobbledygook. The state of modern theoretical physics .

Greene is a good comminicator. Too bad he wasted his career on string theory
These two icons are the Alpha &amp; Omega of Astrophysics.
They eyes chico. They never lie.
To my mind if Inflation did take place there are 2 possible ways of thinking about how it happened. One is based on the belief the Our Universe is all there is therefore something happened within the boundaries of Our Universe which forced the expansion. The other is based on the acceptance  of something existing existing outside of our Universe into which our Universe inflated into and rather than a our Universe being pushed outward it was rapidly &quot;Drawn&quot; outward into the surrounding Void.
With respect to the  &quot;Many Worlds Hypothesis&quot;I just keep coming back to this problem: If you extend the branching ‚Äúsharing‚Äù of the Wave function Energy, that existed at Time Zero, to infinity then the energy of each individual branching World must approach Zero and hence if Energy is, in fact,  conserved the totality of the Energy of the Wave Function of the Universe at Time Zero had to be Zero and if that is so then Where did all the the Energy come from at the instant of the Time Zero when the first branching occurred. It puzzles me and defies Logic, as I understand it. You should not be able to start with nothing and then have something and then go back to having nothing. How is this possible? I have not been able to reconcile this problem. What Am I missing?
There is one possible &quot;Fix&quot; for this and that is additional Energy is constantly being fed into All of these  new Worlds from the Quantum Wave Function State.
Homogeneity on that scale? Inescapable in a closed system, elusive in an open or &#39;expanding&#39; system. Entropy is neither the question or the answer. Its what&#39;s left over when the universe ends, so why worry?
You want to ask the big question and get a big answer? Go sit in a foxhole when bombs are landing all around. or in my case, get into then out of a shitty trauma case, in one piece for both oneself and the patient. A little life is good for philosophy. Ask Buddha. Look at Kant, never got out of his room, downstairs from Emily Dickenson and across the hall from Nietzche, no straight jacket required. Then you got Huxley. Huxley, what an ass.
This makes me feel better. I thoought we had answered all the big ones. These guys are clueless, and they are staring at a blank TV screen and handing me a line about Creation. We did that with our first bong hit when someone changed the channel to a nonworking station and we all grooved on the chaos.Far out man its the cosmic debris.<br>Physicists should question their questions. Philosophers should answer the answers, with a question. Ask the psychologists the question&#39;s answer to get the jump on them from asking you.
Incest in physics and philosophy- the inbreeding explains a lot Pharoah. (Pro inflation? Are they in the current administration cabinet?)
Physicists flip over entropy. It&#39;s a consequence of chemistry. It represents the ineficiency of a chemical reaction. It is a statistic. It&#39;s not real. You can&#39;t put it on a cracker, cracker. A rabbit hole Alice won&#39;t truck.
In the egg analogy about entropy, how did the egg get there?
Sean or Brian: Is it possible, in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, that the other possible worlds generated by an observation cancel one another out and we are left with only the universe we live in? I ask this based on the Feynman statement that photons traveling from point A to point B explore all possible routes but that all these routes cancel with only the shortest time route surviving.
Love your approach to sharing information. Great events.<br>Any chance you come to Calgary, Alberta?
Mismatch. I wonder if those galaxies that have disappeared because they are no longer observable have anything to do with that number. Some galaxies have accelerated past the speed of light already. Is there a calculation for how many galaxies can&#39;t be observed anymore because of that? Does it have anything to do with the problem anyway?üòä
I assume the videos from the science festival happening now in New York will be available to watch after the 24th when it ends?
bigbang,<br>how much faster than light in the beginning did the world expand, now that we have been waiting for the light that came after us for 13.8 billion years?<br>Isn&#39;t it possible that this light has gone before us?
This is the second video I&#39;ve seen where Sean hypothesizes that the arrow of time may have pointed in the opposite direction in the &quot;far far far past&quot;. I wish he&#39;d make some attempt to unpack that as it&#39;s such a radical concept to throw out there with absolutely no explanation.
Listening to them is like science therapy.

The best physicist duo ‚ù§ what a treat to see these two discuss many topics I know nothing about
Sean is a true gem. Great teacher and inspiration.
It&#39;s amazing when you have two of the top brains of the history discussing universe! üéâ
eternal inflation sounds like the zimbabwean economic model
Loved the discussion around philosophy. Totally agree with your views!
I confer with scientists conducting quantum gravity research using loop quantum gravity and string theory. They&#39;ve observed intriguing hints that spacetime properties at the Planck scale unintuitively emerge from relationships between energy, momentum and duration.<br><br>Meanwhile, physicists exploring Abraham-Minkowski controversy and zero-point field fluctuations have noted analogies between inertial and gravitational mass, suggesting a deeper connection to embedding space-time in an aether-like quantum foam. Their work investigating inertial induction and radiation reaction may shed light on how power flows interact with subatomic mass currents across ephemeral timescales.<br><br>Back in our reality, physicists at my alma mater, the Parallel University of Everything, are devising ingenious gedanken experiments involving gravitational time dilation within miniature dynamical Casimir systems. The interplay between Casimir force oscillations, Higgs field interactions and proper time could reveal novel mass-energy-power-time functional dependencies in that contextual framework.<br><br>While conclusive experiments are still ongoing, collectively this research points toward rich mathematical structures linking the terrain of mass, energy, force and temporality. Who knows - maybe one day we&#39;ll devise a Theory of Everything across all imaginary numbers! In the meantime, keep questioning and exploring... the answers are out there amidst the Infinite Possibilities.
If i hear the phrase &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; ONE MORE TIME!!**$# <br><br>lol üòé‚úåÔ∏è
Right.... we would just round it off to roughly 68% - 70%, in terms of Dark Energy proportion of what the Cosmos is made off ... even though our calculations show Dark Energy is actually roughly 10^100 more.... Why?  &#39;cuz we gotta allow ~5% of the Universe to be normal matter (of which we, planets, and sun are made) and 25% - 27% to be Dark Matter.  <br><br>Folks, hate to keep saying the obvious, but when facts --- according to the very calculations of the very scientists who keep repeating these IMAGINARY proportions to you (that the Universe is made up of Earth/25%, Fire/25%, Water/25%, and Air/25%) ---  keep saying that these &quot;best and brightest&quot; don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, you should believe FACTS.<br><br>It&#39;s religious, not scientific, when you grabbed exact numbers out of thin air and asserted them to be &quot;facts&quot; (of what the Universe is made of), with the line of argument of: &quot;We are the best and brightest in society (2-5 PhDs from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, etc)... who are you to question us and our impeccable random number assignations?...
How is it possible to learn the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in a tertiary setting and NOT learn about entanglement? I thought it was a fundamental aspect of the concept. ü§î

Our universe is inside the brain of a being that is different then us. Just like we are the universe to beings that are different to us. And who knows,  probably goes on forever. Smaller and smaller
May I suggest that these guys familiarize themselves with the truly revolutionary theorizing of the brilliant Nima-Arkhani Hamed.  &#39;Course, if they did, then their theorizing will prove to  be the empty shell that it is in a world where, as Arkhani-tHamed has stated, &#39;space-time is doomed.&#39;  But then of course, oops, there goes their adoring acolytes, and there goes their inflated egos.  As Max Planck noted, science progresses one funeral at a time.
Wow!
Entropy is a ‚Äòpathway&#39; which does not require ‚Äòenergy‚Äô to exist; at least some energy to push over a glass of liquid?
Hahahahaha.... same old stupidity... there is no way a system can be isolated due to dark energy... therefore seing those guys talking about entropy is disappointing and misleading.
My two favorite physicists (so far). Loved them in Sean&#39;s Mindscape podcast. These two talking about their field of expertise will never get boring or old.
Has the gravity been weak?<br>Do you know more about that, gravity?
Awareness is known by awareness alone.
James webb telescope works like Lord&#39;s view(in the bible)? Then why there is still flat earther?<br>School will teach now they can predict  2 electrons scattering without knowing superstring theory is right? What do you mean? I think you see every details through telescope however you must change storyS of what you see every time you are influenced by influencer. I wonder what&#39;s that?
String theory? Why they look for popularity? Youtube reveals their big name is being made exactly same way as other cooking youtubers. HAHA they laugh out loud over black hole thing..<br> Why they should conduct with other scientists&#39; achievements when they show lacking responsibilities on their own?
By <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2483">41:23</a> I had already two thoughts, 1.) a big bang inside of a big bang and ..2.),...being inside a black hole while being ate/coalescing by another smaller or larger black hole.  (The relation between gravity, electrons, negatively charged, and...the ability of the sun to harbour an electrical source. ) Nature abhors a vacuum. So I dont get how we cant see a vac that simply happens (with or (without) a big bang source to point to as the cause of everything is so impossible to imagine. Its interesting how Einstein was quoted using the word &#39;reality&#39; in some historical context, because at what stage of his scientific contributions did that happen, was he a young whippersnapper or an aging professor? Because did he mean a  future reality or past? Really interesting to hear mentioned that about the isolation chem students felt from one of Einsteins most famous equation. Great, great, great talk. Thank you!
Don‚Äôt need to know it?
The Theoretical Brothers.
what of this rumor that expansion has stopped????
Great stuff! - I love listening to these guys talking about these big questions!
Great guys, fairy tales‚Ä¶ it worths to buy a book :)
Very stimulating!   These guys are my rock stars.  I find it amazing that a few brilliant humans are starting to understand the fundamental nature of the universe.  Not bad for a bunch of sapiens who share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees.  I&#39;m currently trying to understand quantum gravity and the possibility of a theory that reconciles relativity with the quantum domain.  My hunch is no.
Fantastic
please get together for a casual dinner at a restaurant, the two of you with lenny susskind for about three hours, and stream it on youtube, it would be phenomenal for history.
Why don&#39;t the &quot;greatest thinkers of our time  talk about the &quot;platform&quot;  that causes the laws of nature to exist.  I will ask:  what is causing the laws of nature   physics constants,  spacetime geometry and quantum waves to exist?<br><br>Do we just assume, by physics magic üéâ, that physics constants,  spacetime geometry and quantum waves all exist for no reason?
Mostly fluff, speculative, could be, might be, don&#39;t know, who knows.. sorry to say. others can agree/disagree as they like..
yay more Science Fiction!
Nice to see the cool physics guys together!
Love Sean Carroll, we are lucky to have him in the science community. He has a fantastic understanding of all the models and I love how he can explain things clear and concise. I&#39;m one to believe that we could have Many Worlds and CCC both be partially right.  I don&#39;t see why there couldn&#39;t be Many Worlds as well as Cyclic Cosmology. Both really explain different things. Many worlds explains Quantum weirdness and probabilities and  CCC attempts to explain the start of the universe and end.
The only path out of this in my mind, that truly seems to fix the low entropy / early universe problem is something akin to Pentose‚Äôs Conformal Cyclical Cosmology, where the scale of the late high entropy universe no longer means anything, and you end up with a point where space ends up naturally falling back toward what looks like another big bang.<br><br>I know there might be issues with it, but it‚Äôs one of the few ways out that could make sense.<br><br>Brian and Sean, both of your collections of books have inspired me greatly! Much love ‚ù§
Where in NYC? He gives no address
Very nice! thanks for all the talks, sessions and conversations to expand scientific knowledge, approach and discoveries<br><br>Will the September sessions be streamed live in the channel?? I am eager to watch them!
i look at inflation as a fast but not instant process of appirance or change of field that give (quantum) time and thus the space a sense and during inflation time change radically, now time gradually slows down, that couse space expansion (observer visibility). Time changes because of that field change. Objects with mass change that field too, but massless particles only follows this field but not influence it because massless particles timeless in quantum sense.
matter and antimatter. Is the symmetry out of balance because we haven&#39;t found antimatter yet?<br>Matter + antimatter = nothing, not even energy, not even space
Always great to see Brian and Sean share their thoughts. Would be interesting to meet them over a beer and see how things go.
This is like 2 nerds talking, and I love it. I hope one day I would be capable to talk something like this with some other nerd.
‚ÄúIf it resonates with one of us, it will likely resonate with both of us‚Äù damn, sounds like some quantum entanglement between you and Sean!
I&#39;m struck by how you two sound so much like my high school friend and me marveling and somewhat debating, in circa 1971, about how the structure of the atom was essentially a tiny solar system. The only minor difference is that that concept is wrong and that you guys are brilliant and we were and are not. Otherwise -- remarkably similar.
Boltzman did not trust his  mathematically  conceived original  conjecture s&#39;&#39; origin  well enough to live long enough to get validation, did he?  BTW, 1 + 1 = 1 solves the entropy problem if you think about how the moebius band with its twist point adds 1 + 1 = 1 <br>is it a fact that anything man conceives will manifest eventually?
Most of us NYers don&#39;t know why the Manhattan Project is called the Manhattan Project? Smh wow I just learned something new...
If you run the math backwards on an expanding orange on a tree, you also end up with a big bang. You don&#39;t end up with a tree, a seed, and previous tress. Universe = same.
I enjoyed this so much! Thank you both
I am fascinated by this. <br><br>So fascinated that I went to the WSF website to see if I can quickly fly into NYC On Saturday!! <br><br>( I am a brand new attending physician :D)
Thank you gentleman, pure fun and nice to see Physics, Philosophy and Cosmology coming together.  Kim
Super symmetry, if you add the bias into it, perhaps it may be more fruitfull, because the asymmetry in assuming 50/50 or perfect evolutionary choice in evolving one way or another, may not be true for the reason aforementioned.<br>That there is an innate bias, which can be given thru recursion to space itself for example, the guarantee a certain kind of unpacking, so it is with kosmoses, and their inception.
46 min, the type of measurement may affect the data, purturbative vs. nonpurturbative for example.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2585">43:05</a> secs, entalgnlement may have to do with self similarity in space itself. Again this fractal nature of space... when volumes become symmetric.
Loop quatum gravity may be a bit of a distraction, the effect of accretion may have to do with space itself... it may be this underlying type of fractal domain in space.
when the energy is unpacked, it may be that the energy , since it is in fractilized space, lends kinetic energy to itself in the way it is unpacked via the gaps.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2427">40:27</a>, Profesor Carrol, you may want to use the equations for future sight is you want to make a more complete study of the arrow of time.
Thank you again for posting üôÇ
Since energy is stored in space that is fractilized at the core, its data unpacking can perhaps be thought of something like normilization, you can probably use Collatz Theorem as well, to study energy unpacking out of compressed fractilized space. Frame dragging is the outer boundary, staggered energy and gaps of space.
Thank you posting, I appreciate your effort in making these videos, and posting them. Have a great day, and find the Eternal part of the day, known as joy.
Perhaps order is seens in the collapsing and coalesence of the automated processes which produce the coalesced forms and matter. That is to say, they are inherent in the accretional processes which form a kosmos, and subsequently which give it its notes. This bias is inherent i think in ALL kosmoses, I dont think they just form 50/50 will develop life and the other will just have rocks lets say. the processes ensure that they DO both kosmoses for example , harbor life.
You know crap you full shiiiiiiiit

Ya know Sean really hasn&#39;t impressed me when his wife and he showed themselves to be so arrogant. Since then, eh, no thanks. Just another science communicator, just with a novel prize. See his arrogance is now rubbing off on me. This is your fault, Shawn!
*nobel
How did they show themselves to be ‚Äúarrogant‚Äù?
Dark matter is the longest ongoing mystery in cosmology. We don&#39;t know anything more about it than did Fritz Zwicky when he discovered it back in 1933.
The concept the universe is flat is as strange to me as the laws of entropy. Can you give a framework that might allow me to understand enough to ponder on the subject a bit?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=3620">1:00:20</a> I completely agree. QFT is equivalent to Newtonian physics. It&#39;s a good model, but there&#39;s a better answer which explains dark matter, dark energy, and where all the antimatter went.
What is this whole &quot;writing a paper&quot; thing? Can anybody write a paper? Do u get paid ?
The douche brothers
??? Are you just super religious or something?
I believe Brian Green is wrong about everything.
Love the Black Hole behind Brian! Dont get too close
I just don&#39;t enjoy listening to physicists anymore because they are so full of crap.  No new wisdom.  No new good ideas.  Several terrible ideas like MWI, repeating universes, etc.  Tired of being told by a bunch of liars that God doesn&#39;t exist.
ALL God&#39;s attributes were defined/given by Man who is uncomfortable with not knowing. Science/physics is excited by not knowing/mystery. It gives the motivation to solve the mystery. And so far, EVERYTIME a mystery was solved, it had a satisfactory physical explanation. NOT ONCE has there been a verified supernatural explanation for any solved mystery of the universe.
‚ÄúTired of being told by a bunch of liars that God doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù <br><br>Such a telling statement. You‚Äôre literally claiming the best thinkers in the world are ‚Äúfull of crap‚Äù because they don‚Äôt tell you what you want to hear. Sad stuff
You are GODüòâ
@@coreyleander7911 Isn&#39;t it amazing that the same people who scoff at the existence of GOD, also can&#39;t tell you how the laws of nature/physics, physics constants or spacetime geometry can exist without any visible or physical means?  As if by magic.
@@wulphstein no they tell us how the laws of physics, physical constants, and ‚ÄúSpacetime geometry‚Äù exist. And they tell us precisely how by physical means and laws. <br><br>What does it say about you that you‚Äôre <b>just</b> angry that you don‚Äôt understand the science, thus your false claim of it being magic, and are angry it won‚Äôt tell you what you want to hear about God? It‚Äôs a cowardice about mortality more than anything. <br><br>If you want to play this game, then you should be talking about how physicists don‚Äôt understand the origin of the Big Bang. But again, you don‚Äôt understand the science so you make the stronger false claim that they don‚Äôt understand anything else about physics, or the origin of it.
Lately, to some extent my scientific and philosophical mind has become somewhat dominated by the all but certain fact that there are far more advanced beings out there in our universe that have all the answers to all the questions that occupy our minds. It occurs to me that what we need to do is learn to be better at being social beings in our universe, and the answers may come to us by way of a shortcut from the friendship of others.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=908">15:08</a> Pacific<br>As an object with mass is accelerated towards ‚Äúc‚Äù it‚Äôs length is shortened in the direction of travel and its experience of time shortened.  At the speed of light it‚Äôs length and it‚Äôs experience of time would be zero. In other words it would become a 2 dimensional object without the experience of time!  Therefore objects with mass require a dimension through which they can move and experience time. Time requires dimensionality and dimensionality requires time.( Is this the true meaning of spacetime?)
I have just decided recently at 30 years old that physics is the field i want to pursue my whole life and everything around this seems to be disappointing and trying to make me quit believing the I actually can.

Entropy is not what we are witnessing in the cosmos. Humans witness entropy and close systems on earth. Time is the fabric of the universe. Time is not a closed system. Time is it open system. Matter has to be able to flow through time freely, in order for the universe to function the way that it does.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=4220">1:10:20</a> Two unknown constants were still present in the required equations: a and Œõ(0), and now it was required that in the case of a weak curvature of space-time (a weak gravitational field), the Poisson equation was obtained from here. This is the case when a=-1/2, Œõ(0)=0, that is, in 1915 Einstein wrote down his equations without Œõ(0), which ensured &quot;The great success of Einstein&#39;s theory.&quot; (Pauli). However, being convinced of the correctness of his philosophical beliefs, alas, physicist Einstein in 1917 decided to change the equations by adding the term Œõ(0)g(ik). But after Friedmann&#39;s solution (1922) and Hubble&#39;s discovery (1927), there was no need to add a cosmological term, and the equations restored friendship with the Poisson equation.<br><br>It seems that modern manipulations with Œõ(0)=(8œÄG/c^4)T[v(00)], where T[v(00)] is the vacuum energy density (spacetime) in a locally Lorentzian accompanying frame of reference, are devoid of physical justification, since in Einstein&#39;s theory there are no solutions for a completely empty and to attribute any properties (for example, acceleration) to something unknown, obviously, a simple fitting of the theory to observational data to the detriment of &quot;great success&quot;. <br><br>How would Einstein react to this? Probably like this: &quot;A good joke should not be repeated twice.&quot; (Einstein).
As politics in US depends on &#39;pay for play&#39;, so in science &#39;a brief tour of everything&#39; is like someone has stopped all funding to physicists. They can continue arguing when gravity isn&#39;t quantized or how QM fails to show how probabilistic world can become deterministic. Physicists look like politicians like Zelensky.
It‚Äôs really clear MAGAts like you are simply jealous and angry at the size of the gap of knowledge between uneducated people like you and graduate school educated physicists. Thus you resort to simpler things you can understand like politics to understand physics. It‚Äôs so sad and telling. Imagine thinking being compared to Zelenskyy is an insult
Listening to these smartest gentlemen gives hope that humanity is not doomed...
Just read the comments on this video to see it is in fact doomed. Right wingers desperately trying to politicize physics and science.

Is it possible that when we look back from the present space and time instance down the rabbit hole into the trajectory to the big bang, we may arrive, not at one single but an unlimited number of big bangs in space? <br><br>Is it possible that the chosen trajectory into the past rather depends on the countless individual branches you choose in the cloud of branches (as opposed to a tree of branches)? <br><br>Would that alter our ideas with regard if the arrow of time, ie would it be a sphere of time which leads to countless small bangs, bangs in the order of quantum sized energy fluctuations which collectively, by bringing them all together in an imaginary spot in space time, looks like a big bang with a mysterious beginning out of a singularity? Any thoughts about that?

It‚Äôs insane that you right wingers don‚Äôt see the obvious. You‚Äôre literally desperately trying to politicize science and discredit it because you know it doesn‚Äôt give you the answers you want on religion or climate. Truly evil what you people do ‚Äî trying to hold back human progress
@worldsciencefestival thank you for providing this space and sharing this conversation, thank you Brian and Sean for allowing us to listen in on this conversation. Peace
Can&#39;t we just say God made everything , and stop complicating things.?
Saying, God made everything is what complicates things. The universe is simple. The theory of everything is time. Time is everything and everything is time. Simple. We experience time through our star the sun. What is your age? No star no growth. What are you breathing? No oxygen, no consciousness. Don‚Äôt test nature by holding your breath. Breathe! While breathing read more non-fiction. Dictionary. Encyclopedia. Thesaurus.
It‚Äôs so obvious what you right wingers are doing. As the gap between uneducated people like you and the most educated people like physicists and mathematicians grows, you feel resentment at what you don‚Äôt understand. So you try to negate all of human progress so you can feel better about your chosen intellectual inferiority. Enraging
@@tyroneallen7857why do you talk like this? Nothing you said in this reply is correct. Time is not everything, especially not energy like you‚Äôve said elsewhere.
IF THIS HELPS,I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE &quot;THE ARROW OF TIME&quot; CAN GO SLOWER THAN NORMAL,THAT&#39;S ALL I KNOW FOR SURE!!
I thought that with the findings from the James Webb, the idea of the Big Bang has been put to rest, but unless I am mistaken, both these eminent scientists mentioned it as the starting point of our Universe. Can someone clarify please?
These &quot;news&quot;, that Big Bang &quot;has been put to rest&quot; were typical internet pop science misinformation...
But it hasn‚Äôt been put to rest. Stop being a layman
Just saw this and I‚Äôm totally geeking out right now üòÖ
two of my faves! I could listen to you both for literally hours
Nice orators, though I would argue some things they say.  The multiverse nonsense and how easy it is to disprove. Black holes censorship, time and particle production at energy dinsities. Inflation with FTL and no FTL in a vacuum seen. Alice strings and rings and the ALICE detector. String theory E8, and E24 and which fits better with quantum theories. Color theory and snark graph theory with gluons and photons connecting border states. Planet crackers and killers. Fluidic neutrinos in blach holes. I could go on, but no point. Black hole ‚ôæÔ∏è is a lack of calculation and the distortion of time/space. 2 limits come from that. Students have done some of that work with when black holes evaporate. Gripes over. Keep spreading info, maybe one day one of your people will get to talk to me. lol not holding breath. The religious delusions tend to keep people held back in ways. Good luck with wonderland. XD
I truly love these two men. So good to see them together!!!!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
This was a fantastic and engaging show all the way through! Thank you.

It would reverse sign and the repulsive force would grow asymptotically below the LQG scale a ~P.l.^1.6. Hence a bounce scenario is supported by LQG.
Shame?
@@coreyleander7911 Sean is a cosmologist, he should be aware of major advances in LQG which is foundational to Loop Quantum Cosmology.
thank you WSF
Thank you for the Uploads! Maybe soon some about Quantum Entanglement; whilst Symmetry is broken, for Matter to do it&#39;s Gravity?!
Maybe some big bounce, rather than a big bang in it. Not necessarily CCC
So In reguards to entropy it‚Äôs because of the Higgs mechanism! If it‚Äôs fundamental is also important!
If there was a concept that links the nature and source of gravity with the strong Nuclear ‚ÄúForce‚Äù, the mechanisms of Dark Energy, and Dark Matter, would it be worth a moment‚Äôs consideration? Particularly as it seems physics is in a ‚Äúwhat are we not seeing‚Äù state regarding Gravity?

If supposedly the dark energy expansion rate has varied throughout the history of the universe than it would also be admissible a sudden and exponential inflation after the big bang.
You and Shaun appear to be ENTANGLED PERSONS!!!
This is awesome.
Interesting to see that both Carroll and Greene have no idea what the arrow of time is, or time, for that matter. Carroll, again, comes up with entropy, which in essence has got nothing to do with time. Time doesn&#39;t run backward in your fridge. And let me tell you a secret, the supposed arrow of time doesn&#39;t even exist at all. Both Carroll and Greene, like many physicists, confuse reversible, cyclic and oscillating reactions (or laws of physics) with what time is and how it functions. Simply said, you cannot go back in time, which shows that the arrow of time doesn&#39;t exist.
When you started talking about the arrow of time going in both directions it got me thinking. If we could get ourselves to move &quot;backwards&quot; in time, could that just mean that we stop moving in our own time and just start moving in the forward direction of a mirrored universe? Then when we stop our &quot;backwards&quot; time direction, we&#39;re right back at the same time as when started in our own universe?
I think that something √Æs missing in conven»õional naratives. Fields bring order, structure, Fields create order energy, energy √Æs conected with Information, Information May obey some laws that minimise desorder. So, we have 2 oposite tendency, order and desorder. Flow of Time √Æs conected with low presence of antimater. Quantum microspaces entangled, 4 for fotons, thetraedral structures and complex structures composed by mathematical lows conduct to identity of elementar particles, teleportation for all movements, frames of reality, paralel realities, not √Æn faze, historys made by entangled events, Time √Æs just a parameter associated with one  univers history, we can do quantum jump from one history to other by a change of faze.

Very interesting conversation by two contemporary physicists.
Absolutely the best!
I mean, who noticed the Flash title track modified was the opening track! üòÖ
I like the World Science Festival.  But it almost seems to cover only physics, and astronomy these days.  I wish they spent more time having guest on that covered more fields of study and specialties.
Love Sean and Brian, they both have done this so much and are very skilled at public science information and should be rewarded for their incredible contribution to public general knowledge.
I am SO happy! My two favorite physicists together. Can life get any better? I don‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶
Brilliant. Realistically, what can I hope to add to what&#39;s already been said below / before.  I would guess that most of this audience are fans of one or both, of either Brian Greene or Sean Carroll anyway. There is also a Mindscape episode where Brian is the guest. That is pretty good as well -  and I&#39;m sure it is still available on Sean&#39;s Mindscape Channel.  And they have both written some great books - especially in high-quality, popular science for the non-specialist. Many thanks to both Prof. Brian and Prof. Sean. for sharing this enlightening conversation. Please do this again soon, when Entropy is just a bit higher !!
Great talk all the best. ...
Wow these two guys together
There is another way of looking at the arrow of time and showing that time must always move in the positive direction.<br><br>Just think about light. The speed of light is positive, distance is always positive. Distance = speed x time so time must always move in the positive direction.<br><br>Even though the mathematical equations allow time to move in the positive or negative direction, in reality it only moves in the positive direction. Richard
Speaking of the big discrepancy between the observed dark energy value and the calculated one, I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re surprised there is such a discrepancy. We know there is dark matter out there and if there are dark matter fields, then we haven&#39;t included the contribution of these fields to the dark energy. If supersymmetry is also true (at higher energies than what the Large Hadron Collider can probe), then these fields also contribute to the zero point energy.<br><br>So we shouldn&#39;t be surprised that we have such a big discrepancy between the observed and the calculated value considering we&#39;re missing these contributions.<br><br>I actually think that maybe we have some symmetry where the value is zero, but the symmetry is broken at our low energy scales and this returns this very low value that we observe (10^-8 ergs/cm^3) instead of zero (this is just a hunch, I wish someone with the actualy quantum field theory knowledge could come up with a model).
What a wonderful surprise to wake up to this treat!
I&#39;m so glad that Brian mentioned the idea of very long random fluctuations that, just by chance, at some point end up just being uniformly distributed such that they start inflating: it&#39;s been my own idea on how the universe started from low entropy for quite some time. If you have fluctuations (although I&#39;m not sure where this is happening - do you need an already existing spacetime where these fluctuations happen or do we have fluctuations of spacetime itself, like a &quot;bubble&quot; of spacetime with different energy distributions popping in and out of &quot;nothing&quot;?) that happen continuously, then at some point, just by chance, a particular fluctuation will have its energy distributed uniformly and in it inflation will start, expanding that bubble and not allowing it to collapse back. <br><br>Since the positive energy in that fluctuation can be compensated exactly by gravity with negative energy, the fluctuation will have zero total energy and therefore will be able to live forever (here I&#39;m referring to the uncertainty principle between energy and time).<br><br>This way, only low entropy fluctations create universes, since only low entropy fluctuations can inflate, they are the only ones for which gravity behaves repulsively. So it&#39;s not a mystery why we started from a low entropy state.
The universe can be described as a collection of QUANTAM SUPER MAGNETS with Black hole. at negative pole and positive point spewing out recombined energy particles at the point observed as BIG BANG POINT.  <br>With our limited capacity to observe,  our Scientists postulate theories like BLIND MEN AND ELEPHANT.  Benefit of this situation( state of ignorance)  is there is evergreen scope of new PhDs and voluminous articles and heaps of books. <br>Now to define the universe  is <br>IT IS MULTJDIMENTIAL AND DYNAMIC WEB OF TANGLED MAGNETS WITH BLACK HOLES AT ONE END OF ENTANGLEMENT AND BIG BANG POINT AT OTHER END
My two heros unite
Thank you for this.
Will any of the events next week be live streamed? It seems tockets are only for physical admission.
entropy is the flow of energy to a state of balance in relation to the system, so light loses its energy or, roughly speaking, goes out after covering vast distances, just like an electromagnetic wave attenuates over a distance
expansion of space is an illusion
Hi professor brian green and sean caroll is my favourite physicist and science communicators I have been watched their videos for nearly four years when I was in my secondary High school
Entanglement is a simple manifestation of karmic resonances between the merkabas of two souls or soul collectives. It is the same phenomenon that underlies paranormal experiences, and why dabbling with spiritual powers irresponsibly can get you in a lot of trouble if you tangle with demonic daemons
so-called entanglement is nothing more than a coincidence
@Va1demar¬† Don&#39;t be so sure of that. That&#39;s what all NPC souls think till they exercise their consciousness enough to spot their own synchronicities. I get a kick out of Pinocchio souls thinking they are the sharpest tools in the shed of humanity, so sure of their singular perspective because it&#39;s so narrow. NPC humans are like single slit experiments to more conscious observers

@@Va1demar yeah they are and yeah they can. Just because there are things they haven‚Äôt yet been explained doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt. Everything you‚Äôre engaging in at this very moment, except perhaps consciousness, is entirely explained by physics and thus math. The device you‚Äôre communicating on, your biology, your location in space/galaxy, etc. Just because we don‚Äôt yet have a complete description of consciousness or the origin of what we call the Big Bang doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt. We are steadily making progress on both questions.
@coreyleander7911¬† toot your small horn, NPC. Your programming is obvious. FYI I have studied physics cat Princeton, and know for more than you about the realities of science, which contraryvto what numby gumbirs like you think, is not decided by the consensus of the self-proclaimed high priests of materialist scientism
@@coreyleander7911 The devices on which we communicate are called words and logical apparatus, and how do physics and mathematics explain this?
@@theomnisthour6400 ‚Äúsmall horn‚Äù ‚ÄúNPC‚Äù ‚Äúyour programming is obvious‚Äù literally only ad hominem here. This is the problem. The gap between the educated and uneducated only continues to grow and this makes the uneducated like you resentful.

You certainly weren‚Äôt educated in physics from Princeton, there‚Äôs no reason to lie further. And there aren‚Äôt priests that decide what physics is. Again, this is your political populism coming to the fore. You think this is political because that‚Äôs the limit of what you can understand ‚Äî you can‚Äôt understand the physics or math so you reduce it falsely to something you do understand, politics. Your anger also seems to be with physicalism and materialism, and how that leads one to doubt the existence of a God or souls.

@@Va1demar you‚Äôre kidding? We‚Äôre not communicating right now over the internet and some type of computer? To answer your question though, are you seriously unaware of the field of linguistics ‚Äî the study of language? It is rigorously based on *mathematics*.
@@coreyleander7911 Linguistics is strictly connected with semiotics, mathematics was not nearby, what can you say about space without reference points?
@@Va1demar no. Linguistics is based on set theory and mathematical logic. So mathematics is not only ‚Äúnearby,‚Äù it comprises and makes up linguistics at its core. We measure locations in space relative to the galactic center and other galaxies ‚Äî with physics. Lol. If you‚Äôre referring to an absolute location in the <b>universe,</b> that can‚Äôt be done given the finite speed of light and cosmic inflation. These concepts are all precise and known because of physics and thus math.
@@coreyleander7911 and if light does not propagate in space indefinitely, but is limited not only in speed, but also in radius, what can you say then about the size of the universe? if you are based on confirmed and verifiable facts, then who checked the range of the light beam?
@@Va1demaryour comments are no longer appearing in my notifications. Light does propagate in space indefinitely. We can currently see light from the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave background. What do you mean ‚Äúwho checked the range of the light beam‚Äù? We can‚Äôt say anything about the size of the overall universe, since light hasn‚Äôt had time to reach farther than it has. We can only talk about the observable universe, where light has so far reached.
@@coreyleander7911 did you see the farthest objects well? what Webb showed can hardly be called clear and obvious, your understanding of the universe is also limited by the resolving power of the telescope, the better the telescope, the older the universe turns out to be, in general, your boasting does not distinguish you in any way from the applicants with whom you argued earlier, you look like a fanatical adherent of the canonical church that fights sinners who reject your faith in the almighty god of science
@@Va1demar so you‚Äôre repeating the false headline you read about JWST showing the universe to be 26 billion years old or whatever? The fact you think me merely stating that I study mathematics and physics is boasting is my whole point: you uneducated people resent that you don‚Äôt understand math and physics like some of us or try to do, and even resent us for doing so &amp; getting angry when people like you invoke religion or claim science has established nothing. <br><br>Again everything you say is an indictment: you quite literally call people getting angry at someone who lies quantum entanglement is a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù manifestation of ‚Äúkarmic resonances‚Äù as adhering to religion and faith, and trying to punish sinners. Just incredible. To you, science is just another ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when by the very definition of science that is false. Faith is by definition a belief without evidence. Science <b>only</b> operates on evidence. <br><br>I can‚Äôt understand why people like you exist, just desperately trying to halt or slow human progress
@@coreyleander7911 who proved that there was a big bang? you took this belief on faith, who measured the universe and proved that it is expanding? you accepted this belief on faith because you didn‚Äôt measure it yourself and you have no evidence, you are a believing adherent of the church of scientists also it turns out they‚Äôre preventing you from thinking and promoting discoveries, making progress, it turns out you‚Äôre also a schizoid
My two heroes. ‚ù§<br>Fascinating that chemists in 2005 thought E=mc^2 was irrelevant to chemistry.

I guess i had a pretty good science education!
The multiverse is a progressive set of experiments that converge on virtual worlds without beginning or end, enabled by the fully developed individual string of God, a template pattern for other souls to dance around, as they play with their own universal identity simulations till they find a felicitous dance floor for their unique or shared karmic resonances. It&#39;s not all possible universes, it&#39;s all desired universes for as long as there is enough spiritual energy to sustain the thought that created each universe and gave some time and space for its dance floor till it&#39;s god&#39;s or goddess&#39; music attracts no more conscious dancers and becomes a stagnant universe of NPC souls entertaining the lonely mind of a loveless deity till they choosevto reassimilate with BORG, to develop a new pattern of identity that might be more attractive. All discussions of single universes are stale scientific dead ends, devoid of the spirit that breathed life into the multiverse. The proof of tge multiverse lies in simple deduction from the big bang, which was obvious lying a duoverse, a universe and an anti universe evolving under the leadership of conflicting principles. This dual test tubes of conflicting principles is in evidence at all levels of creation, and is what  is driving the existential crisis of our species - developing a better government for souls of all ages, strengths and weaknesses. Humanity is the final chosen species of this grand social engineering experiment, and the final major version of the laws of reincarnation and karma are the product of the Gaia experiment&#39;s conclusion

I‚Äôm confused. Wasn‚Äôt the egg originally just particles which genes brought together, thereby showing a reverse of entropy. Also, stars take small hydrogen to make the larger helium - again the reverse of entropy. The creation of planets, or trees, or animals all seem to bring a balance instead of a one way trip.
TLDR; Creating an egg requires the existence of low entropy source like sun and overall entropy of the universe does increase. Hydrogen to helium conversion is high entropy transformation because the situation is messier than before(released energy going in various directions)<br><br>Creation of the egg does require entropy reversal. But that comes from somewhere else. In order to reverse entropy for the egg molecules, animals need to take entropy from somewhere else: plants etc. Plants get their entropy from the sun. Which ultimately leads back to big bang. The overall entropy of the universe is  increasing , some local parts may reverse entropy like an air conditioner cooling a room, but that increases the overall entropy of the universe.<br><br>As for the sun, hydrogen going into helium leads to more entropy. Because the energy (light etc) that is released during conversion between nuclei can spread around in many ways and keeping track of that is harder than the state before the conversion. It&#39;s more messy and more entropy has been added.

Looks like you are discussing relativity in a few short paragraph, lol. Good line of thinking. Sharing a parallel not too dissimilar line of thought. Dimensions are dimensions because each dimension can be independent of the other, at least in space this works - x, y, z. Time flows independent of the x, y, and z, only both are affected by universal constant, c the speed of light. Now because of that, x,y,z, and t need to obey that rule of constancy of c. So space contracts, time dilates, and space curves. Now, when we take into account that measurements are affected by the speed light, it gets more interesting in the cosmological and quantum scales.

This was written about year and half ago and  rewritten two days ago on real physics YouTube channel:<br>Here you find the explanation of why Time is a process not a dimension, you have to read till the end to be able to understand: There‚Äôs a difference between Time is the measurement and Time is a process l, because time is the process of measurement (that is why they couldn‚Äôt understand what time is till this moment ), clock hands (minutes and hours) are the reference (memory) the calculation of seconds (The tick of the clock, and oscillation in atomic clocks )  is present time (future in clocks has different approach, clock itself doesn‚Äôt recognise future)<br>to concise the whole process is time (it‚Äôs a PROCESS)<br>in human brain the whole process in clocks takes place but humans have memory and can anticipate future (next step based on previous experiences or calculations but in clocks they have fixed pace unless something happens to seconds hand ) so in human brain there‚Äôs a whole process (ticking or oscillation, processing ‚Äúincluding cognition ‚Äú and memory.<br>in human brain the processing itself is the present time and the result of processing is the past time ‚Äúin memory‚Äù.<br>in pysics it requires space to calculate time, but in human brain probably works at level close to Planck‚Äôs length,. in human brain there are more than one clock, one is very accurate such as how humans reach perfecrion in shooting, and other games, and inacurate clock that works in conscious experience (daily life) and that is more effective (no need for high accuracy). clocks can‚Äôt recognise time but human brain can. there‚Äôs action but could be quantum action or possible mental action in the brain too (but very likely Quantum action) (so-called Quantum action could be the minimum action). talking about space here is in the classical physics (normal equations where we calculate speed and distance) but that is the core of clocks in general (time = distance / speed) the shift in seconds hand.  but there‚Äôs minimum action (Planck‚Äôs scale). mental clock requires action too but different approach. to concise human brain can recognise time unlike clocks (it‚Äôs a process). Planck is one of the best former scientists.<br><br>Hopefully the idea is clear, I hardly can focus.<br><br>I think the idea is that time is a bit complicated: why do you need the minute hand and the hour hand? Because time is a process and not just the ticking of the seconds hand, here I am talking about the conventional scale of ordinary clocks , and I am not talking about the scale of atomic clocks, but it is the same idea at the end. but there‚Äôs a big difference: clocks can‚Äôt recognise the ticks of seconds hand but humans can.<br><br>There‚Äôs a mental clock for sure: it‚Äôs the result of continuous approximate calculations of dimensions and speed, it‚Äôs inaccurate but very effective in usual daily activities such as: is that narrow road is enough to my car to pass through?!, but there‚Äôs other type of time which is very accurate and very likely based on physical clock similar to atomic clocks.<br><br>to reach perfection in some shooting sports (repeatable) indicate that there is a very accurate clock (probably more accurate than modern clocks), in human brain (very likely) it is in cerebellum, accompaned with  other accurate caluculqtions such as wind speed,‚Ä¶.etc. of course all that happen unknowingly.<br>There is a huge difference between the fact that time is a process and the explanations of previous physicists (there can be no middle ground for this and even trying to approximate the logic behind them will not work)<br>They even had no deep understanding of the most important and seemed simple equation: speed = distance √∑ time<br>the role of energy and how they calculated time!<br>This seemingly simple physics equation shows how they took time and space as axioms and built on that, but that is not the solution to a deep understanding of the foundations of physics (current physics has reached its limits). This simple equation is absolutely the most important physical equation and shows the relationship between the most important foundations of physics and the extent of the current superficial understanding.<br>The interrelationships between the speed, distance and time says that there‚Äôs a very weak understanding of the fundamentals of physics.<br><br>Notice: dates are older (copies of previous thoughts)
what is great is that these two don&#39;t always see eye to eye, but the discussion keeps us all honest, if they have to argue, then that means they are sincere.
W = MG<br>gravitational force  vs  gravitational acceleration.<br>potential energy vs gravitational potential energy.<br>equivalent principle; the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass.<br>,‚Ä¶..etc<br>Everything indicate that the current interpretation of equivalent principle is incorrect: very likely Gravity interacts with each particle independently regardless of its location to other particles in the same object, and that is why all objects fall at the same rate. <br>That‚Äôs far better interpretation of : <br>W = MG<br>gravitational force  vs  gravitational acceleration.<br>potential energy vs gravitational potential energy.<br>equivalent principle; the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass.<br>Physics needs to be reviewed by real physicists, but this will require a deeper understanding of the foundations of physics.
There is still a huge chance we know absolutely nothing and everything is an illusion or a simulation.
No not at all. There‚Äôs a huge chance in the other direction given all the experimental evidence to the contrary.
Accidentally, it happens to break from an equilibrium; now eagerly waiting for a moment to be back on its initial state. Unfortunately,  all the attempt makes it more complex  rather to be settle. Fortunately we itself are the building blocks of this UNFORTUNATE. Surely we find our home,  let us sail hardly...
Do people agree that without quantum entanglement we could not have E=MC^2.  Meaning that to get the formula to work something has to happen faster (at least at the quantum level) than the speed of light.

Brian and Sean‚Ä¶ the 2 best online physics tutors! Excellent guys
The gayest passive aggressive fight I‚Äôve ever scene
Hello Dr Brian Greene! Recently, I watched an interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson, where he refused to accept any place of philosophy in modern day Physics. What is your point of view on the topic?
professor Sean Carrol is my favorite physicist in the world. He is such an awesome science communicator..Brian  green is also legend as well...hyped fork this discussion...
Watching on repeat‚Äîbut this is keeping me from getting to my wordle! üòÇüòÇüòÇ.  Agree‚Äîeasier to watch together than have to watch them both and say‚Äîoh yea those two are on the same page.
I could listen to these two all day
Please broadcast the talk between you, Sean and Carlo Rovelli of the 23d of september. We need it ‚ù§
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=2220">37:00</a> ish - ‚Ä¶ and what is the LOWEST entropy state of the universe? Is it in line with current theory to say that at the time of the Big Bang, the universe was in that lowest entropy state? I think it is. But does that mean that as entropy TRENDS upwards over time, LOCAL decreases of entropy can never go below that initial entropy measure? If that is the case, the object currently known to us as the lowest entropy object in the universe, the human brain, must have a level of entropy HIGHER than that of the Big Bang. Would that be a fair characterisation of the dynamics? If anybody shared their insights on this, I‚Äôd appreciate it.
You guys have no idea that there is a Creator who has taught me everything beyond what you can only dream about. By the way, we are living our Creator&#39;s dream ( programming ) for each individual created mind that is processing his programmed thoughts into what looks like a real world but only as an illusion. There is no real universe and never has there been one.
Why is it so hard for human-oids to imagine some sparkles and then there is space time. <br>Nothing has to be &quot;there&quot; for something to create &quot;there&quot;. And once &quot;there&quot; exists, space time sits on &quot;it&quot; like a duck on the water. And if you are honest, you KNOW quantum fluctuations exist AND do things YOU can`t explain...
They originally attempted to do this interview in person, but the mass of their brains together in 1 room caused gravitational distortions.
You mean space distortion, right?
These two guys are my favourite science communicators - I attended Sean‚Äôs talk at the Royal Institution in London the other week and he was absolutely brilliant. What I love about his style is that he tries to make the maths behind the formulae approachable. Of course it won‚Äôt replace a university degree but a layperson with some mathematical background (perhaps A-level, college general studies level) will develop a far deeper understanding of the subject than they might get from reading journalistic articles or some of the books in the pop-science genre that are out there.<br><br>I think Brian and Sean do a great job also in getting young people to study science, maybe those who are ‚Äòon the fence‚Äô, who have an interest in the subjects but are unsure about a full-blown university degree. To those, listening to their excellent podcasts and reading their books must be like fanning the embers of a fire.
Lucky yo!!! The rest of us will just have to wait until the RI releases a YouTube broadcast.
At my house, plural of math, is, wait for it, .... math!! lol    Now onto my &quot;five a day&quot;. lmao.   &quot;Right&quot;. &quot;Brillant&quot;. &quot;Garden&quot;. A different world.

Science rocks alright but, Science of the Body now there&#39;s A Thing; but for differing interpretations &amp; kno Actual Experience: That Matters a great deal you know {Evidence}, over &amp; against Manipulation of Results!?! {\}
Glad to listen them thank you
Why not both of you do some knitting while talking?
IMO there is confusion between - Entropy increases in the direction of time (makes sense because of the nature of state space) and it&#39;s corollary time direction is because of increasing entropy (NOT). I agree with former, not the later.
Exactly, as I pointed out in my comment a few minutes ago. Both mix up entropy and flow of time (which doesn&#39;t exist, as the arrow of time doesn&#39;t exist),
What Sean does, studying astrophysics and quantum physics and philosophy is what leads to spirituality !! <br>This knowledge can bring Nirvana to anyone who understands it ‚ù§
Now you need to define Nirvana
Why is minkowski space metric (negative sign in the distance equation)  different than a Euclidean space metric? Isn&#39;t that the explanation for direction of time being only one way?
Two of my favorites at once!  Really excited to watch this!  Thank you so much for making these videos!
- [ ] A brief tour of the future <br>- [ ] Certainly AI within the next 25 years will change humanity and the anthropic principle forever. If humanity survives 50 years from now how will self learning AI influence and interact with humanity?<br>- [ ] I love the characters Data and his brother Lore as examples of self learning artificial intelligence. However, if humans are to survive with artificial intelligence in the future the Borg model is more likely. Humanity will most likely have to stay connected to the internet at all times resembling the queen bee model. I would assume self learning AI at some point would see the depravity of humanity as an inconsistently problem. For both to survive together humanity will have to change. Or?<br>- [ ]    I think the important thing to remember is that self learning AI combined with quantum computing and unbreakable encryption codes that will allow the ability of artificial intelligence computers to connect to other AI quantum computers and  then form their own AI languages and self learning technologies blocking man out of the process. If humanity and its inconsistency and depravity are seen as a threat, what will happen to humanity?<br>- [ ]    50 years from now if humanity survives, the anthropic principle will certainly be changed by self learning artificial intelligence. Moreover, as AI and quantum computer inductive predictive programming increases to the doubling of processing power from 18 months down to say 1  hour every hour combined with deductive processing power, where and what will humans be? Will they be attached to AI like the Borg model or at war like the Sky Net model?<br>- [ ] This subject matter would be perfect for the next Star Trek movie. <br>- [ ] I would love to help out with that.
I do not get the reversibility of time discussion around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=710">11:50</a>. If there are two oppositely charged particles near each other, the process of them coming closer or moving away is by definition breaking the law of opposite charges attract. Am I missing something? Even in two billiard balls colliding example the two will be hotter after collision in one direction and not the other. No?<br><br>IMO opinion, there is a confusion due to circularity between the definition of forward and backward when it applies to time. Time simply has direction, forward, and it is the direction in which before event and after events go - refer to Tim Maudlins thoughts on this. Time is a dimension but a time like dimension at that and is not a space like dimension. The Minkowski metric of SR spacetime tells us that. So SR spacetime is not a 4D object of 4 dimensions that are qualitatively similar but a 3(spacelike D)+1(time liked D) object. And thus the forward and backward notions that do apply to space-like Ds should not be applicable to time-like D. Think of it this way - a  +ve and -ve altitude of a place relative to sea level can be a meaningful physical concept. But +3 apples is a physical concept but -3 apples is not a physical concept. The talk of forward and reverse time is just not applicable.
Be welcome. <br>Simmetries and concepts also, as ever, we are inspired by the sum of your communicating efforts and hope in other people üôèüóΩ <br>Aware of our belief, continue, never stop, like inertial movement in a particular medium.<br>You both are looking greatüëå.
How do you respond to Tim Maudlin&#39;s view on the arrow of time?
August 7th &#39;23 I emailed Sean&#39;s team, and also Susskind, because I found (pic is in my community post) dated paper by me pre 2013 Susskind&#39;s ER=EPR,, saying &#39;wormhole physics&#39; and I linked wormholes to String Theory as Einstein crystalized time, and +4d string hyperspace &#39;loaf&#39; explains quantum entanglement particle spin correlation as crystalized spacetime in hyperspace, dated Aug. 3rd, 2011. I knew I&#39;d thought of it in &#39;07, but I found evidence I had, pre ER=EPR, while watching sn6 ep3 of The Big Bang Theory where sheldon gets help looking thru old stuff,, I saw the line after i looked thru my stuff.. &#39;m very smart n my subconscious must of known I had yhe paper somewhere. I got 100% grade for semester learning Calculus in high school, and am also diagnosed schizophrenic and voices tell me what is about yo happen in shows, so if I&#39;m not like John Nash schiz. then I&#39;m smart and a real person wanted me to find my paper, either way.<br>In the paper, in my community post, I say the whole universe &#39;dna to celestial bodies&#39;, which is like this vids title, so maybe Sean suggested it because of me, idk.. or it is a known thing to reference,, theory of linked quantum and Relativity theories with examples. Check my pic in my community post. Like yo, guys, i have more. And i can use such in my scifi story &quot;psy v cy&quot; psychics vs cyborgs PvC, and like theory,, if JWST shows we&#39;re in a blackhole, then I show how an or the original universe doesnt ER=EPR into or out of a blackhole,, inside a blackhole has more degrees of freedom or dimensions,, but i suggest that such is for fields for forces and particles,, our 4 force fields are how String Theory 11Ds are, we are a hyperverse and outside our membrane aka universe aka blackhole?? is more dimensions as in forces, and in a blackhole is less (the thought about part for blackholes, but hey Susskind says noone knew ER=EPR stuff, but i guess i did at latest in 2011, before him in 2013, so what else did i theorize first). A video from World Science Festival on er=epr quantum wormholes said blackholes &#39;er=epr&#39; Hawking Radiation, but me.. that is how we could go into a parent universe, then the origin universe does decay but instead grows dimensions as in cyclic universe, and could be dark energy and matter. From quantum fluctuations as HUP Heisenberg Uncerainty Principle and that is still embedded in existence from nothingness (Sean knows nothing, not space. Exactly, space is not nothing, nothing is nothing) for how universe or existence comes about, and yhat is the definition of space as different local spots relative to eachother and different times, nothing is different from the start of nothing as something,  me 0 into 1 i stance of 0, 1(0). Then that is soacetime growing and info entropy growing, relative to eachtoher, and then energy and matter grow  from space growing in 1(0) instances of space but as a field, which is how and why origin universes grow like cyclic universe theory into having more fields.
???
@@peterdamen2161 oh, uh how Sean and Brian mentioned infinity, also 1/0 is nonsense answer, and 1(0) that I show has 1 thing, but when you take out the (0) of it, ur doing /0, which is undefined and gets a nonsense answer. I think, it is like finding a limit in Calculus or precalc where one find the proportions of like (x¬≥+1)/x¬≤ and it is approaching like the proportion of the limits ,,i dont think that is what one does but it is just &#39;like&#39; that, finding proptions of infinity. Like 10¬π¬≤‚Å∞ dark matter or energy mentioned, is there a way to make it versus amount of space itself, so space and dark stuff is proportional.. if this is accounted for, then i think it just shows space may be bigger than we thought, FI the JWST sees our universe may be twice as old, 28billion years, as what was thought before. Like higgs ?operation?  might not be an accepted but it is already kneon thing.
Inflation is the true theory, it is proven by experiment every month when I realize my money is worth less than before.

Great show guys thanks much. The language follows scripture well. I enjoyed translating this show and using my understanding to learn from you.  Folks , In God We Trust is not a logo. What does it mean you? To all of us? Being under one God means all of us. We need to learn to use it all together!
Physics and science has absolutely nothing to do with religion , you have an idea with NO evidence what so ever , science has  empirical evidence that contradicts all of the monotheistic beliefs , Judaism , Christianity and Islam all have miracles and a creation story that are incompatible with the evidence , the laws of nature are constant and evolutionary biology is at odds with those creation stories . The ignorant goat herders of the bronze age middle east had  myth and legend not based on evidence , like all cultures myth and legend it falls short in the 21st century and those that believe that bollocks have left the ability to think honestly and critically at the door when they entered their cult of choice or were psychologically tortured into believing when a child . Science and physics is an HONEST look for answers that explain the universe around us , you have already made your mind up and now have to fit the data to suit your poor choice of explanation .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Jv5sWQI&amp;t=3020">50:20</a> I believe the &quot;spooky action&quot; misnomer is derived from the belief that photons are particles.  They&#39;re actually waves.  It&#39;s a wave of energy that connects the measured particles together and creates the constant of time. <br><br>It&#39;s a lot like the positive and negative convention is backwards in electronics. Your taught the opposite however and it&#39;s difficult for people to realise the blunder.  The only argument that photons are particles is within the photo electric principle.  But a closer look shows that the photon is absorbed by the electron.  And that&#39;s it.  No more photon. It&#39;s absorbed by the particle.  You can no longer say that the photon exists.  It&#39;s like, are you a cabbage because you eat cabbage.  No, it&#39;s cray cray.  Someone really needs to clean up science.
Thank you both so much, I am profoundly grateful for your generosity of spirit.
I&#39;m just saying, how are you going to generalize all people within a field of study?  More money doesn&#39;t mean more truth.

Listening to two very intelligent and articulate human beings is sheer joy!
I guess  wave functions and more than light speed collapse of a wave function is more like a property of quantum world  ,rather than a physical thing,its importance appears only with an observer ,all spins are similar for an electrone , it&#39;s electronness is equal for every spin   but for an observer electrone has a change with respect to it&#39;s spin.<br><br>So I think this instantaneous communication between the particles may not have a physical level of communication rather it could be a communication via properties, electrones exist but spins don&#39;t they are properties of a particle,so why can&#39;t some shared properties exist between them ,<br><br> cosmic speed limit is for existing things i believe, properties are observer dependent entities ,so can it have some wierd properties like collapse of a wave function from everywhere at same time?<br><br>Particles or quantum excitations are real and existing , but wave functions exist only as properties i guessü§î

They clearly listened attentively to each other, connected on ideas without talking over one another, and had a smooth, engaging back-and-forth flow. Their respectful yet vibrant exchange of perspectives was not only intellectually stimulating but also a lesson in having a thoughtful, enlightening dialogue. Inspiring.

I agree entirely this should be a model for all our conversations!
Something about the vacuum energy of space causes normal matter to fly apart rapidly (look at the very fast expansion velocity of thruster gas exhausted from rocket launches at dusk or dawn and from the rocket engine bell) makes it seem as though repulsion effects of molecular gas in a vacuum is the natural (dispersed) state of molecules/atoms/ions in a vacuum? Thus the reason the larger the rocket engine bell, the better (even a 1/2 mile wide if it were possible) to increase vectored thrust efficiency in a vacuum.

I went to school in the city in Indiana... I learned nothing there. I learned everything I should have learned at school by doing it myself. Including learning physics and mathematics. Still no Einstein with either but I do understand most of it.

I haven&#39;t even watched it yet, but I want more!
Dear everyone, I wish you peace inside your soul. We are all light and all connected, don‚Äôt be scare, all gonna be ok. Your futur gonna be fantastic because you are fantastic. Thank you so much for your reading.
The only thing dark about those days of the virus where how everybody was a sheep and listen to idiots telling us what to do
Why don&#39;t you give it a rest. Repeating this kind of rhetoric shows us who the sheep really are, sir. Do you have any thoughts of your own on this matter, or are you just going to keep repeating &quot;your sides&quot; &quot;party line&quot; in the comment section of YT videos for the rest of your life? Please, grow up. It&#39;ll be better for you, and those around you.
Penrose&#39;s CCC I think is much better and it has the far future and past being the same as you said.
Inflation wouldn&#39;t be possible in a time symmetric universe. So you would have to give that up if you want to believe in inflation.
Ah, I wish i had gotten in to ask both of my favorite theoretical physicists if the recalibration or recalculation of the observed and calculated age of the universe is inevitable as part of the refinement of the work of hard physical science? And not a sudden pulling of the rug from under? I tend to think overall the former and thankfully the conversation pretty much covers this overall!

wow what a treat my two favorite bedtime story tellers
Absolutely brilliant.  Fantastic that Dr. Greene provides the opportunity for the audience here to learn from the greatest minds of our generation.  I always watch, listen and learn.  Sean Carroll is one of my favorites and these two together are definitely a treat.  P.S. for Dr. Greene.  Lenny Susskind is one of my favorites too.  I am a nuclear and electrical engineer by profession and I took the time to watch Lenny teach QM on video from Stanford.  I really enjoy it when the two of you get together and I especially love his Feynman anecdotes.  Please do something again with him soonest.  I have watched everything you and Dr. Susskind have done on YouTube.
I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you, those guys are misleading ordinary individuals.

What&#39;s happening in the media lately?! They have nothing useful to add to science! Just promoting useless books (sophism). The issue revolves around preserving the world of illusions from which they make a living! But what about real science and the responsibility towards future generations?!

Stop pushing strings and inflation, they are not proven or observable or testable.
One  possible explanation that would explain the Asymmetry would be if  the  BB was result  of the collision between two pre-existing Universes one being comprised entirely of Normal matter and the other entirely Anti-Matter in which there were fewer Anti-Matter Particles Than there were in  the NM Universe. So since the The fact that there was less AM Particles in the AM Universe than there were NM Particles in the NM Universe would explain the Asymmetry we see today giving rise to the disappearance of the AM.

The Big Bang Theory - that 13.7 billion years ago there was nothing - then a big explosion happened, is the most ridiculous idea mankind has ever had. You don&#39;t need years of scientific training to see the stupidity of it. If there was NOTHING 13.75 billion years ago then there was nothing to explode. If there was an explosion 13.75 billion years ago then there was already something there to explode - hence there was something existing already, which means it couldn&#39;t be the beginning. The universe can only be infinite and eternal.

Greene is a genius at interviewing. All the right questions and not a single unnecessary word. What a goldmine of information Mather is. All of his answers were interesting and clearly expressed. What an exciting life he has been living.  Big puzzle: why not a Nobel prize for adaptive optics? I would never have guessed it would work.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwYHQ6YwwuY&amp;t=1200">20:00</a> not the only story that matches, but one of several stories and the reality is that you have measured the INFINITE UNIVERSE LIGHT coming from the event horizont ie where visible light is no longer constantly reaching us, but with some irratic appearence, AND THE MAP SHOWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATTER BEYOND THE VISIBLE/EVENT HORIZONT which you call the age of universe...UNIVERSE IS INFINITE IN MATTER, TIME AND SPACE
BLACK BODY CURVE showed you that you are measuring OTHER VERY FAR (THEREFORE NORMALLY INVISIBLE) STARS...since this curve shows the bonds between atoms (...we mostly call them covalent (two electron), but can be small amount and metalic or ionic (single electron) ones...) which are broken with some intensities at some temperatures and therefore producing frequencies AND THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS that are normal for OUR MATTER (obviously heated till evaporation and dissolution)
also no black holes were needed to form the Earth or light up the Sun, therefore there is no need for them and to glue starts into Galaxies...mass is just uncompensated nuclear positive charge and exists only 2 fundamental forces Electric and Magnetic that are interrelated and do not exist without each other
the more we learn only reveals how little we actually know.
All that was missing was a pint of cosmic beer for each of them. Such a relaxed conversation with a mound of interesting information. Both asking questions, both answering questions, just like friends. Great conversation Brian and John, keep up the great work.

. In the past, for various piddly reasons, Brian Green has not been my favorite scientist. In this interview however, he was fantastic. Many times, interviewers will ask long, 5 minute questions just to prove how smart they are. Here, whenever Brian Green &#39;interrupts&#39;, it is to clarify a point and then he says---  OK, this is where we were before, let&#39;s continue...
Is it possible that we&#39;re seeing so far back in spacetime that we&#39;re actually looking back at ourselves from behind? Maybe the universe is curved around on itself, and because of it&#39;s immense size that we can&#39;t perceive the curvature?  The way the Earth seems flat from the surface.

Awesome guest. It is becoming rarer and rarer for people to actually listen to questions and directly answer them. So many use any question as an excuse to just start talking about what they want. As usual Green asks the right questions  to get answers that intend to fill the gaps between what a knowledgeable audience know and what is realistically understandable.
It&#39;s become so rare that it&#39;s almost off-putting when someone doesn&#39;t try to dodge a question.

Entropy is a spectrum. Highest entropy is the final disorder which includes the infinite complexity and infinite symmetry. The transition between the two is the arrow of time. Infinite complexity is finite. If I may use the analogy of, when an unstoppable force (time) collides with immovable object (singularity), we observe to the best we can, a Big Bang (White Hole) erupting its content into time from infinite symmetry restarting the cycle towards infinite complexity.

Yeah time has come to the point we can&#39;t say if a comment is manmade or A.I. made.!!!üòÆ
Folks. I took the battery out of my watch and i stopped time. It would seem that time is not an unstoppable force.
@@patrickaycock3655 So you still had a battery in your cell phone, did you take a picture of your watch as evidence?
@@rezadaneshi sorry. I didnt have time.
@@patrickaycock3655 Augustus said ‚Äúpast no longer exist, future not yet exist and present takes no time at all. How can we say time exists‚Äù. Ironically the argument against your excuse of having no time, questions existence of time itself. You must be really proud of yourself Now!
Keep in mind that time in essence does not exist, it is just our common sense judgement to pinpoint exactly the location and duration of an object from point A to point B. We make sense of the world in discrete packets and concrete durations. But in fact, we are receding away from the Big Bang or point of creation as space expands which violates the arrow of time. Space spreads, time stretches and the cosmic rug unfolds while us humans are embedded in it like a slow motion movie üòÖ experiencing the entropic dance of life. Initial conditions of a low Entropy macrostate would be the Big Bang (high quality energy) and since then the Entropy has increased. When we reach the final disorder or highest Entropy of final destination, end of the journey or ‚Äútime‚Äù, all matter and energy could coalesce just like a black hole where gravity is too strong for anything to escape (not even light) and we could possibly slip into another Big Bang restarting the cycle again üòÖ Until then and by the time this happens a final theory of quantum gravity could somewhat solve the observer‚Äôs mystery for the deeply hidden realm üòèü§î
@@yasminegannam1989 I‚Äôm pretty much with you on everything you wrote but the fact that you‚Äôre equating end of time instead of switching direction on arrow of time to anti time which would be a contraction of spacetime, makes it part of the cycle of time anti time like orbit. Space is infinite but ultimate complexity of spacetime on space is finite. Some argue we never left the black hole, maybe because at ultimate symmetry, duality of matter doesn‚Äôt exist just like singularity. Singularity being infinite space infinitely packed with massless charge less dimension less particles, leaking particle anti-particle pairs into time right outside their event Horizon. Cyclical universe as you said, changes but we really don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs frame by frame or continuous with gradation, either way, what we call time, is a manmade unit that either deceives us entirely measuring the wrong thing or a coherent assumption hoping for quantum gravity. Ironically, if time is continuous and not quantifiable, there will be no gravitons and gravity remains a hybrid of when quantum particles play in time. We call it consciousness in discussions of human complexity, time introduces a kind of particle consciousness that create a field for all similar particles to behave in unison interacting with other particle fields. We take the ‚Äútime‚Äù out of equation when we collapse a moment to observe a particle in 3d as if it was a singularity. Intuitively, gravity is not behaving as if it is quantized.
@@rezadaneshi Wow! This seems like an AI generated response!! I mostly agree with what you said and I would like to simplify it to the best of my abilities üòÖ the passage of time (or flow of time) is the ultimate complexity of our Spacetime. As space (infinite) expands time (finite) slows contracting spacetime making it part of the cycle of non-real time, or orbit. On a larger boundless scale of an eternal cyclical universe, we perceive ‚Äútime‚Äù as frame by frame as in discrete packets. However, ‚Äútime‚Äù is actually non-real but continuous, or at least this is how we make sense of it (or more accurately as ‚Äòcyclical‚Äô). ‚ÄúTime‚Äù like entropy (can be created) &amp; exergy (useful potential work of the energy, can be destroyed) do not fit into the description of truly physical quantities, or quantized. At conserved quantities, mass and energy fit into the description of truly physical quantities. Everything is made of matter (more correctly, mass-energy). Hypothetically, the arrow of time is non real. The second law (inc. in Entropy or arrow of time) deals with quantities that are of a different kind of existence, a universe in which things come into existence out of nothing and go out of existence into nothing (like what you said, almost like a singularity). Strictly speaking, everything is reversible except the complexity of our own human consciousness. Constantly interfering and interacting in unison with other particle fields (irreversible). Also, gravity creates a curved Spacetime (a distorted time dilation). Intuitively speaking, time like gravity cannot be quantized. However, in the future we hope for a coherent assumption of quantum gravity. üòÖü§îüòä
@@yasminegannam1989 I can‚Äôt wait to hook up with a quantum computer then, where I can do unlimited calculations in zero time and become a singularity. And as such I‚Äôd say ü•∏ because someone‚Äôs watch records seconds and minutes and hours for her tasks, and because someone is a curious pattern seeking meaning making machine ü§î who studied Quantum physics üßê, where there is no time, therefore no gravity, why is she insisting on quantum gravity, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è must have become her religion!

This is the greatest discussion I&#39;ve seen with Greene. And literally the only one where I didn&#39;t feel like he was ahead of the conversation at all times. Martin Rees is truly an extraordinary mind. I have a feeling I&#39;ll be coming back to it periodically for a long time.

If the big bang were true, then why did all that mass and  energy expand instead of collapsing into a huge black hole?
.... also what about the galaxies that are older than the big bang that James Webb telescope is revealing... it&#39;s not &quot;filling in the gaps&quot;... it&#39;s dragging the whole big bang theory in to question.

Collision of branes JWST has  demonstrated a very big void  1.8 bilions  LY across.  Which can concure  with string tjheory, as branes
Rees is such a good listener.  Just watching his facial expressions as he&#39;s listening to Greene talk is a curiously pleasing experience.
Thank you. Still it seems ‚Ä¶ impossible to my human frame of reference, that the entire universe existed in something smaller than a child‚Äôs lunch box, and ‚Äòbanged‚Äô itsel into being.

The word evolved has become a word with no meaning or purpose to me. If any thing it has the meaning of stupidity. Science in my mind has made it so. How is it we see the same things in such a different way? This to me is mind boggling. So I say God Bless.
In terms of the implications of their work, scientists might have ethical responsibilities. But so then do politicians who decide how the products of discovery are (ab)used. Particularly in light of recent events in the Levant, how much trust can one have in political moral responsibility? Personally, the evidence convinces me the answer is, none.
Maybe &#39;electronic&#39; lifeforms (digital, analog mixed or other?) will develop from probes and self-replicating  exploratory devices launched by &#39;purely biological&#39; organisms. Particularly, as will be the case within 50 yrs, if the probes we send out have self-modifying (improving?) AIs running them. I wonder how such entities would come to understand their own origins? Would they manage to make the imaginative leap back to planetary surface origins? There&#39;s a movie franchise right there!

So we know how the car vehicle works but no idea where it started it&#39;s journey or where it&#39;s taking us, or the make of the vehicle, or the identity of the driver.
So much of the observable Universe is organized and comprehensible so the Big Bang is a intelligent phenomenal.

Listening to this excellent talk, I get the impression that we are living within a certain bandwidth of modulation on a spatial carrier that modulates waves with spacial frequencies varrying between stationary and the speed of light. At the lower limit, we can probe the inner perceived magic described by quantum mechanics. The shadow that this world casts until our modulated reality, cones in the form of a spread of identical particles, that may have connection with each other at a distance as perceived by us, but local in a reality that is outside of our bandwidth. <br><br>So, there is a universe on its own, captured like a hologram in identical particles that differ only with phase (like real holograms). <br><br>On the cosmic scales, the shadow of parallel reality presents itself as Big Bang, black holes, spacial accelerating expansion in scale (vaguely referred to as dark energy) and dark matter. I feel we may be able to connect these 3 real parallel universes and figure out what the extra spatial dimension looks like that expands our cosmic reality, mystify our sub-atomic reality as described by our quantum Physics gestimation model. <br><br>My question: is there research to probe individual electrons on information carried within about phase in relation to other individual electrons?  Similarly, is there study ongoing that searches fir links of how the hidden dimension at larger scales (speed c &lt; parallel reality &lt; c2.
We should look at new worlds that cast their shadow as described by QM √°nd that cast there other unique shadow on our reality as described by GR.<br><br>The unification of QM and GR goes via parallel universes, beyond our direct horizons. Fields are patterns of these realities.
The optics through which we look at the Universe are too polluted by hundreds of theories like Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity. Therefore, an experiment on cleaning optics is needed. For this I suggest:<br><br>¬†Postulate 1. Light is an ordered vibration of gravitational quanta. Postulate 2. The speed of light, regardless of the source, within the ‚Äúframework of the dominant gravitational field‚Äù ¬† This is determined experimentally using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope (based on Michelson&#39;s experiment 1881-2015). Using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope, the straight-line speed of vehicles can be measured.

@briangreene Do we know how fast the electron orbits the nucleus in atoms?
I think similar to the earth&#39;s orbit speed, so would be very fast from human perspective üòÇ
Hello Sir.. I was thinking that &#39;since Sun is one of the foci of the planetary orbits, maybe the other foci is occupied by antimatter of Sun&#39;.. Could it be possible?
I really think it‚Äôs a waste of time listening to this. All of it is conjecture. The bottom line is that you simply don‚Äôt know any of the answers and to say you do is a downright lie. You know nothing‚Ä¶you can prove nothing. I‚Äôm out.

You cannot prove the big bang. You can practice its doctrine; but, it&#39;s more about imagination than anything.<br>  The big bang is a theistic postulate without any support from physics. It requires an external force for the supernatural foundations to occur.

As to surveillance in the bioterror context, Lord Rees seems to be concentrating on the wrong subject. Not the individual say virologist cooking some deadly pathogen is the problem, but the military worldwide doing so is, in a plethora of labs funded by black budgets. Wuhan is almost everywhere. These days, WHO&#39;s power grab in the making exactly is the strategy to shift the whole health problem toward bioterror issues, enabling a much worse than Orwellian future...

Today&#39;s cosmologists seem all too reminiscent of the State of lsrael: their universe expands, but into what? They appear to believe that it can expand, without implying the existence of further, existing territory beyond its borders, about which they appear in denial.<br>The universe can change its nature but, by definition, cannot expand without a redefinition of the concept. Also like lsrael, their universe is materialistic, encompassing energy and matter but not the space into which it explodes.<br>For them, energy and matter are like an eye defining that which exists by what it can see or touch. There is no God to see beyond that, to see where it&#39;s all going...

Brian, thanks so much for producing these podcasts with such interesting and brilliant people - they really feel like &quot;Candles in the Dark&quot; in these times when so much seems to be going wrong and the future looks increasingly bleak . .
Wierd, was not in person this time.
I think in the future, computers will be so powerful, they will be able to work out the universe mathematically. With human experimental data fed to them as biofeedback. They TEACH us how the mechanisms of the universe work. They do the calculations, and break it down for us. Just as science communicators do to regular people.
Great .. here is the jew who hates Trump
I could literally listen to this stuff for days on end. Thank you both for the educational and insightful discussion.
And if you do,  you might realize how pointless the answers to these questions can be on many aspects... IF every question asked here was answered, ask yourself &quot;What difference would it make to you, me, or even humanity as a whole right NOW. <br>--<br>Would any answers to their questions fix humanity?  Would it fix the russian conflict? The palestine conflict? Inflation?  Hunger?  Absolutely NOT.
@@250txc I really shouldn&#39;t respond to this because it isn&#39;t worth the energy. The answers are interesting to me, and therefore are not pointless. Youtube isn&#39;t a forum for &quot;fixing humanity&quot;--it&#39;s simply a place to consume content based on personal interests. World conflicts are important but I don&#39;t spend my idle time thinking deeply about them.

How come Bri Green never talks about politics anymore? He used to be very vocal on his opinions of Trump.. Guess the child sniffer is his idea of a great president, so as not to warrant any criticism or even comment

Most unproductive &amp; useless thing to ever do is do research about universe. It‚Äôs just waste of all resources like time, money‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Exactly. Point of no return! Almost like a singularity. We are not able to achieve anything because we cant probe everything üòÖ the universe is ending anyways.. a Big Crunch followed by another Big Bang (hypothetical scenario but still has not been confirmed by science). But, how long do we have to wait for another Big Bang to happen with the right quantum fluctuations for life to emerge here on Earth? Experiencing the passage of time on Earth is very slow due to gravitational forces 13 billion years have passed since the first big bang üòÖ a lot of time has passed üòÖ but it is equivalent to just a couple of years in outer space . The experience of time is slow due to gravity. Gravity distorts our perception of space and time (distorted time dilation). As space expands time slows, however, a lot of time has passed since creation. Gravity distorts spacetime (curvature of space.

@@Alan_Berger He may just be a product of his time, a believer in the good of government, that it doesn&#39;t exceed the limits of it&#39;s given power unless given extraordinary reason to. Through that lens, it is easy to say that government should have the ability to see and hear all. I imagine he must have read 1984 with a grin and a slight chuckle here and there wondering with amusement how  things could ever get to such a state.

Another useless nonsensical thought that came to me last night.  So entropy of the universe since the BB or cosmic inflation, if there&#39;s no inflation nor expanding of the universe there&#39;s no entropy, right?<br>There may be some sort of mixing going on but it&#39;d move to an equivalent state anyways.  And that&#39;s it.  No sub-atomic particles transformed to quarks to protons, neutrons to atoms to molecules if no expansion of space, right?  There&#39;s. A limited matter and expanding space making the temp down thus they&#39;re being transformed to ... hence entropy.  If the expansion had stopped before CMB, everything would have stayed at a plasma state, no entropy, wouldn&#39;t have gone nowhere, right?   ? ? ?
They&#39;re pushing the idea of giving up privacy again, haven&#39;t we heard this before? It&#39;s pretty ridiculous, and it clearly shows that Greene and Rees don&#39;t really get how computation and innovation work when you restrict human behavior. Take Edward Snowden, for instance. Despite being under constant scrutiny, he managed to sneak out sensitive information.

I always thought if the Big Bang existed we would show the galaxies far way would be closer to where the point of explosion occurred, but what we have found seems to be a universe which was already expanded beyond where we are at the beginning of our ability to see galaxies.  So we came of with a new theory.  The main reason for this theory seems to be so we could keep the Big Bang theory. Now we theorize the expansion is increasing?  So there was a very fast expansion, then everything slowed so we could see what we see, then expansion is increasing again.  I don&#39;t think we need to throw away what we have done, but we need to refine our measurements and be open to a new theory if it fits all the hard points.
The bigbang happened everywhere in the universe, there is no center, there was no explosion... hypothetically speaking.
Yep, as the comment above said: the big bang didn‚Äôt occur at a single place. It occurred ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù. We know space is expanding, but it‚Äôs not expanding in one direction from a source to a destination (I suspect many people mistakenly view the known Universe as a sphere, with the big bang in the centre - this is actually mistaken). It‚Äôs more accurate to imagine the space between all objects expanding in all directions simultaneously. <br><br>Also, technically speaking, we only know that the early Universe was very hot and dense. At a certain point, known physics break down. The label we use to describe the point beyond is ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù. However, technically, we don‚Äôt know what the Universe‚Äôs initial conditions were. It may be, for example, that there was never a ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù in the way we intuitively understand it. It could be (as Penrose suggests), that the Universe periodically expands and then contracts and expands again - perhaps forever and ever. Also, some theories suggest that space and time themselves are emergent properties and are not fundamental to reality. <br><br>As humans, we experience the arrow of time. It is plausible that we are trapped by our experience of time and are unable to access its true nature. As a result, even positing a ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù of the Universe could be highly erroneous - it may be ‚Äúthe wrong question‚Äù, as some say.
When they discuss giving up privacy they implicitly assume that surveillance would be done by a benevolent authority. However, once you build systems that allow surveillance then there is no control on who would exploit that. Then, an adversary can use surveillance to find those who would make a bio weapon and encourage them to make them!
It isn&#39;t much different for me than the trust we put in our policing systems.  They are done &quot;by consent&quot; and are deeply flawed in practise.  The oversight of policing is woefully inadequate and the punishment for failure is,due to corruption of humanity, failing to correct the issues.  However, those policing failures are critical for the individuals involved, often fatal, but don&#39;t scale up to large populations, thankfully, yet.  That&#39;s not to be certain that the future of policing cannot be made, on purpose or accidentally, to a scale that endangers the majority or all of the populance.<br>Who watches the watcher is a long asked question and is, clearly, fundamental to a system as future pervasive as something like AI will almost certainly become.  Who, and how to control, manage and protect is vitally important.  Government oversight?  Well, that doesn&#39;t work on so many levels already with systems that are not all encompassing (re:policing as described).  Systems that monitor systems?  Chicken and egg situation, who manages, control and protects the systems that monitor the systems, ad naseum?<br><br>We can be hopeful, there is &quot;hope&quot; in &quot;hopeless&quot; afterall.  But it would be naive to believe that we, as flawed humans, have capabilities to control the future safety and security of AI, in particular, and other dangers, Bio weapons, etc.  Sure, we can give up our privacy for a guaranteed safety - I&#39;d be happy with that.  But who/what can provide that guarantee?  Sorry, got no answer, except to say I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY PRIVACY TO ANY SYSTEM THAT IS ADMINSTERED BY GOVERNMENT OR CORPORATION ( don&#39;t leave much, huh?)
I found his Before the Beginning ‚Äì Our Universe and Others&quot; and read it a long time ago.  It&#39;s good to see him still at it!
How do you establish connection between Big Bang and CMBR. Having a wrong premise some times one can make correct prediction.

Another great conversation between two accomplished scientists. This channel is so refreshing.
Needed more than ever these days.
Brian, what the hell was going on in the background at the beginning of the talk? It looks like a couple people walked onto a plank on a construction site, and through a few things over. They keep going away, and coming back.
First off, great conversation, as always. WSF is my favorite brain candy, nevertheless . . . Let the billionaires spend the hundreds of billions (trillions?) necessary for human space exploration? It sounds eminently reasonable at first blush. Sadly, the statement ignores the obvious; every billionaire is a failure of politics, policy, humane governance, &amp; imagination. If the trajectory of income inequality and climate change continues, we‚Äîa civil society that cares about the mass of the electron‚Äîwill die of social suicide long before Elon&#39;s grandkids are growing weed on Mars (Martian colonial life would be pretty monotonous). An increasingly desperate (&amp; well armed) citizenry will not be looking to science and the academy for answers; they will turn to demagogues, clerics, &amp; conspiracy mongers. &quot;We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of the few, but we can&#39;t have both&quot; Louis Brandeis. I kinda doubt that an American dictator (a Christian Ayatollah?) will want to spend much on theoretical physics. But please keep making wonderful videos.
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.  By denying the evidence that contradicts their cherished hypothesis, and the existence of the Intelligence behind it all.
Greene and Rees say that the hotter regions in the CMB indicate higher density, but don&#39;t explain why. I asked chatgpt. Their answer:  In regions of the early universe that were denser, there were more particles (like protons, electrons, and photons) present. This increased density meant that there were more interactions (like scattering) between particles, which led to slightly hotter temperatures. So, the hotter spots in the CMB map correspond to regions where there was a higher concentration of matter.
It&#39;s also why the he mentioned it informs the structure of the universe, the higher density areas correlate to cosmic strings, attractors of matter that form largest concentrations of matter we can identify.
Could the phrase, &quot;World without End&quot; from the English Book of Prayer allude to the idea that there is no end to the universe?
if the universe is 13.8bly in all directions, why are we not in the center of it all. And I believe we&#39;re not but why is it the same in all directions yet we&#39;re not in the center of it all.
Thank you for these valuable educational videos! They are treasures
Return that dirty Templeton money.
Great open minds discussion
there is light in every part of the sky, even in the dark part
Yes!  Pattern recognition is it all there is.  Pattern recognition is logic, science, philosophy, theology, is it all there is.<br>Heres the thing.  There&#39;re two realities.  One is Truth, the ultimate truthor reality.  The other is a practical realistic reality.  Truth, we can never be sure if or when we get it.  We may get to ir but never be for 100% sure.  That&#39;s because of our soliscism, consciousness in brain through 5 biological senses, everything can be a figment of your imagination (consciousness).  And so let&#39;s assume there&#39;s the real world out there, and we do sense it, experience it, the practical realistic reality.  Although ultimately it always comes down to solitudcism.  In science terms, it&#39;s a special relativity and quantum mechanics.üòä<br><br>Ok, so we see patterns.  We see patterns in patterns and patterns in patterns.  We try to figure out the order of patterns and their causalities, what causing what to make it a pattern.  And we apply them, follow them.  If we&#39;re right, we could figure out its outcomes.  We can plan it ahead.  We could plan the future following the patterns.  But at the end of the day we do have to make a choice.  To make a choice, we&#39;d have to evaluate available choices.  So how do we evaluate?  I think that&#39;s where our biological feelings come on.<br>There&#39;re two sort of feelings, physical feelings like pains when there&#39;s a cut or punched or burned or something.  And feelings of physical pleasure, sexual ones or scratching an itch or something.  And there&#39;re meta-physcal or phycological feelings like feeling happy, sad, sorrow, anger, fear, etc.  Or something between like feeling thirsty or hungry or tired or ...  I&#39;ve no idea how or what our brains work in those things, though.  But i think we see patterns, figure out the order of the patterns and try to understand their causalities, and we apply them and follow them to make a choice for our future actions.  Sonething like that, i think, maybe, maybe not.  Something my useless nonsensical wonderings.üòÇ
With the revelations about aliens, idk if the current ‚Äúminds‚Äù of today should be fueling the future. I mean they went head over  heels trying to ignore all these claims by top government officials over the years.
&quot;We might have to disconnect from our electronic devices.&quot; <br>I agree, I can easily imagine a future when our species ends up destroying all these devices. Out of privacy and peace of mind.
chatGPT: &quot;The mass of the electron is a fundamental constant known as the &quot;electron rest mass.&quot; It is one of the most important and well-known parameters in physics, particularly in atomic and quantum physics.<br><br>The electron rest mass is approximately:<br><br>9.109√ó10‚àí319.109√ó10‚àí31 kilograms (kg)<br><br>or equivalently,<br><br>0.510998950.51099895 mega-electronvolts (MeV/c¬≤) (where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, and MeV stands for mega-electronvolts, a common energy unit in particle physics).<br><br>This value represents the mass of a stationary electron and is a crucial part of various fundamental equations in physics, including Schr√∂dinger&#39;s equation for quantum mechanics and the relativistic energy-mass equivalence principle E=mc2E=mc2.&quot;
Enjoyed the conversation.
The style in which Dr. Greene interviews is amazing. He should do a Masterclass on that. Allowing the interviewee time to explain and postulate while simultaneously adding his own perspective and segueing into new topics makes it so smooth and an easy listening experience.
Great show guys.

As for dark matter I just watched a talk from Neil Turok at Perimeter that suggests dark matter may be right handed neutrinos. His idea also does away with inflation, is consistent with Lambda CDM, and has an interesting idea about the Big Bang singularity. At least seems to anyway.

Not even ‚Äònegative‚Äô charged particles. Try ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô. And think differently. Listen to the deeper intuition that postulates the existence of even non- existing.

It‚Äôs like it is with people- some people ‚Äògel‚Äô/ get along with some other people more readily than the rest, but all are supposed to coexist in the social universe. It‚Äôs the same at Cosmic and subatomic levels. ‚ÄòAs above, so below‚Äô is, really, ‚Äòas outside, so inside‚Äô. I‚Äôm not over- psychologising and I don‚Äôt think that the Cosmos was made in the human ape‚Äôs mind, as it predates it. That is, unless you dispense with ‚Äòtime‚Äô altogether which nobody can do.

Yes, indeed.

The suggestion by Rees to subject AI products to an FDA-like review process before they can be used commercially is literally insane, and at the same time, just incredibly naive. Hard to believe such an accomplished person can utter such nonsense.
What an amazing mind and presence Mr. Rees displays!!!!

I asked chatgpt how to predict the mass of the electron.

So what Mr Rees is the past and Mr Green the future? Stop this self-flatulating, ego rub and get on with something worth discussing.
We often talk about the ‚Äòearly universe‚Äô as if we still aren‚Äôt in it.  According to most accepted  cosmology  models the current Universe isn‚Äôt even one  octillionth of its eventual age or size. The Universe isn‚Äôt  big but absurdly small. The  odds of being at this stage  along the continuum is even more absurd.
I get what you&#39;re saying but that&#39;s not what he&#39;s saying... early relative to where we are now, so, no, we&#39;re not in the early universe.
Imagine the odds against this conversation. Enjoy the ride :)
On the A.I. discussion at roughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYVMulMNZMs&amp;t=2100">35:00</a>, it seems to me that we already at the point of not understanding how the A.I. models we have work (not completely completely), and we use those incompletely understood A.I. models to develop new, better and even more complex A.I. models.  Add to that, what we call &quot;A.I.&quot; is not actually intelligence yet.  They are just complicated algorithms.  Real artificial intelligence is likely coming and it will both help us answer questions we want answered and answer questions it comes up with on its own (and we may not even understand the questions these future intelligences are asking ).  We have to be prepared for that.  Someday the smartest and best educated of us will still be like chimpanzees staring at a machine that dispenses bananas.  We will only know the bananas are good, not how the machine is producing them.  The creations of our creations will be engaged in what, to us, will look like magic at that point.
Why would an intelligence that could view us simple chimpanzees happy with the bananas it dispenses to us, continue to dispense those bananas?  Presumably, if the chimps are some how required for the future success of the &quot;magic&quot; AI then it ensure that bananas are forever forth-coming, but that seems even more far-fetched than an intelligence that considers humans as chimnpanzees who need bananas regularly.  Magic-level AI would have dispensed with feeding humans bananas a long time ago, surely?

The biology of memory, when viewed through the lens of quantum biology and consciousness, opens up intriguing possibilities about how information is stored, processed, and recalled in the brain. At its core, memory relies on the complex interplay of neurons, synaptic connections, and biochemical processes. However, some researchers in the emerging field of quantum biology propose that quantum effects, such as superposition or entanglement, might play a role in cognitive functions like memory and consciousness. These theories suggest that quantum phenomena could contribute to the brain&#39;s ability to rapidly process and integrate vast amounts of information.<br>From this perspective, consciousness and memory might not simply arise from classical neural mechanisms but could be influenced by quantum processes at the micro level, potentially occurring in structures like microtubules within neurons. While this idea remains speculative and is still being explored, it challenges traditional views of the brain as a purely classical system and raises the possibility that memory and consciousness are deeply interconnected phenomena influenced by both biological and quantum processes. If true, this could offer a profound new understanding of how we experience and remember the world.
It‚Äôs been suggested that the typical American diet could be promoting protein buildup and plaques in the brain. Seems to me America suffers from 3 related dietary issues, obesity, the same dietary causes for obesity are also linked to Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia, and cancer. So it seems like a logical conclusion to say that that eating high carb diets with lots of trans and saturated fats is linked to obesity, Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia, and the bodies way of combating that with elevated igf2 can lead to the proliferation of many different cancers.. We know that elevated IGF2 levels are linked to colorectal, breast, prostate, lung cancer, and pediatric kidney cancer,. Sounds like America to me.  Can someone debunk me here? I would very much like to know if this is not possible.

Concerning the conference on memory by the scientist Cristina, I would have loved to hear her address the types of foods that helps motivate a healthy brain and healthy thinking. Much of the information given by her, I already read on my psychology books and in molecular biology processes. Maybe Prof. Brian could interview neurologists studying nutrition to enhance the memory and thinking experience. Nutrition that promotes the neurofactors, neurotransmitters production to strengthen the memory pathways on adults and seniors.
MEMORY FORMATION   AND RETRIEVAL <br>        The dentate gyrus which is a part of hippocampus itself, is where memory or   information is stored . It‚Äôs corresponding part can be considered a chip set or hard disk of your computer or chips in smart phones    Just as per theory of semiconductors  ,    in case of the ionic lattice of microtubules , in pyramidal cells of dentate gyrus .<br>          When an electron from covalent band jumps to conduction band , It  creates a hole behind it and overlaps each other , in turn it thus makes an energy gap of less than 1 MVs of electro motive force  .

lots about the mechanism of memory, but nothing about storage/indexing. I would like to have heard some discussion about the location of memories and whether there might be some redundancy built in. Also how our system can instantaneously recall, or assert that we don&#39;t know, a particular fact.

Very good questions. Because nervecells forms a net, which has limited capasity to change, the hormone system helps. But the nature of memory seems to be complex and unclear. It is more dynamic than structural fenomena. Both are needed. The attention to the Freudian unconsiousness was splendid.
My unusual memory triggers are odors and taste, but also the usual songs when I was growing up.

IGF2 is potentially dangerous.  It promotes tissue growth.  It is involved in menstruation and placental development.  Over-expression of IGF2 is implicated in colorectal cancer.

Imagine that your brain cells just like a group of synchronized birds, they are flying north, you are thinking quantum mechanics; they are flying south, you are playing piano; they are flying east, you are mowing the lawn; they are flying west, you are swimming in your pool, meanwhile some birds are still in north direction, you are partially still thinking about quantum mechanics!<br><br>All the sync systems are spontaneous process which obey the second law of thermodynamics, mathematical description may not solve the problem: ‚ÄúHow does order emerge out of chaos‚Äù.

All these sync systems obey the second law of thermodynamics, which entropy reached maximum. When brain cells are in sync, without any extra energy input, the sync will last as long as your life. Sync is energy conservative system which is spontaneous process as well as our memories, imagine some events happened in your childhood.<br>So, let it go! Sync yourself!

&quot;But there is also a close connexion between a coat and the nail on which it hangs, for, if the nail is pulled out, the coat falls to the ground.

No more are we entitled to conclude, because the physical fact is hung on to a cerebral state, that there is any parallelism between the two series psychical and physiological.&quot;<br><br>(Henri Bergson,  Matter and Memory)<br><br>&quot;A coat is solidary with the nail on which it hangs; it falls if the nail is removed; it sways if the nail is loose and shaken; it is torn or pierced if the nail is too pointed; it does not follow from all this that each detail of the nail corresponds to a detail of the coat, nor that the nail is the equivalent of the coat, still less that nail and coat are the same thing. So, too, the mind is undeniably attached to the brain, but from this it does not in the least follow that in the brain is pictured every detail of the mind, nor that the mind is a function of the brain. All that observation, experience, and consequently science, allows us to affirm is the existence of a certain relation between brain and the mind.&quot;<br><br>(Henri Bergson, Mind-Energy)

I already forgot the beginning of this conversation. üòÖ <br><br>The most important thing about memories is that they can change. For example, you can experience something traumatic, and in the short-term remember it in a way that causes trauma - bad thoughts and negative emotions - but then later you can heal that experience and remember it in a completely different way. Now your memory can create acceptance &amp; forgiveness, and a heightened self-awareness, wisdom and higher emotions. <br><br>Ultimately, the past is just a memory. It doesn&#39;t exist anymore. And so, we can learn how to transform the past into something positive, even if initially it was negative.
We can also remember the trauma and be cautious to prevent future traumas.
If you have any good overview reference about this kind of transformation of memories I would love the references.  Thank you in advance.

I  (also not a brain expert at all) agree that memory is necessary in order to be conscious but<br>also that there must be present in the brain at least one memory/thought with a particular content,<br>specifically, the memory/thought we refer to as &#39;the self&#39;,<br>since it is obvious that it is my self who is conscious.
I am wondering why Brian Green has not invited others along this scientist, so we have a dialogue from different perspectives..wish Oliver Sacks would still be alive to participate in this.. also the incredible Feldman Barrett and R Sapolsky etc..
Basically she told us that protein synthesis is important for long term memory and that a small peptide is involved in memory. With all my respect, but this is very few novelty in this session.
I memory act like pipe. WT type of fluid goes on it it take  that form.‚ù§

The audience seems to have fallen asleep. Her manner of speaking has a soporific effect.
Awareness is known by awareness alone.

It was wonderful. Thank you Brian Green.
What would be your life without memories? It cannot exist. Let me switch around: What would be your death with memories? It cannot exist. We have to sacrifice or lose all memory in the process of dying. To paint an existence after death is therefore just an attempt to &quot;calm&quot; our mind, to make us think of something better than the loss of all memory. We are scared of that and &quot;believing&quot; helps to reduce that scare. To preach religious believe has simply two functions: 1. Make us feel better. 2. Control us. I won&#39;t go much into that 2nd reason or function. But the first one is really well meant and helpful and appreciated by many. The second - to me - is an abuse of our memory system for the personal advantage of the provider. When Moses brought the commandments his intention was to control by pointing to a higher power who gave him those tablets. To strengthen our &quot;believe system&quot; for his own advantage as the governing entity. We tend to forget bad experiences easier than good ones. But - not always. If an experience was strong and/or repeated no matter if it was good or bad - we will remember it often a lifetime.
You&#39;re lucky in that way.  Science says bad experiences are much more vividly remembered than good.  Of course peak experiences that are positive are not forgotten but for a lot of us memrories of bad experiences, especially if they were chronic and not a one-off often get worse, more exaggerated in the sense that the worst of the worst comes more into focus and the time elapsing allows us to recall those terrible memories more clearly because we have distance from them.  I found PTSD to get worse and worse over time and also the &quot;last straw&quot; effect can happen when there have been repeated bad memories where something, maybe not all that bad even, is literally the last straw to your nervous system.  That just happened to me -- someone was treating me a certain way and it was very disturbing but I knew I was not in danger but I emotionally freaked out like I would have at the most terrified moment in my memory and i literally felt the same way and relived it.  As for your issues with &quot;control&quot; most people definitely want to be controlled, they are followers that is why everyone is on the internet trying to be exacly like everyone else.  Most people complain -- teenagers mostly -- but they need supervision and structure and someone to tell them what to do and provide feedback throughout their lives.  It&#39;s normal.  Also Sapolsky&#39;s new book about Free Will is an interesting turn of thought -- do we have free will?  Can you locate it?  Is it in the same place the memories are stored (kidding around here).  PS I wish people would follow the ten commandments -- I don&#39;t care who had the idea those are good commandments to follow in life.  PPS a lot of people do lose their memories and it destroys one&#39;s sense of self agency -- any sort of mental malfunction will do that but otherwise they are exactly the same as they were with memories and sadly people often consider them vegetables because they are narcissistic and say &quot;he doesn&#39;t remember ME&quot; as if it&#39;s all about themselves.  No memory?  Great you can have a totally fresh new day every day without all the baggage!
This was amazing. For me, these conversations on how our brain works are the most fascinating.
Loved the questions. Ive had random recalls of things i havent thought of in decades. Especially when music is involved. As if the memory is sitting somewhere perfectly intact, and only needs a key to unlock. Very interesting subject
Thank you! üåàüåà
It is imaginable that memories are not purely internal, but interactive with physical (meaning non living, including plants!) environment, because I consider nature,  although lacks any purpose in itself, yet permits coordinating our own purpose with reference to the environment.
Hopefully Cristina Alberini  is also looking at the research done by Michael Levine and how memories are stored in electrical patterns and also genes in Planarian or flat worms. He also explores the notion of self of single and multicelluar organs/tissues and how it is connected to extents of shared electric field across gap junctions. And how cancer cells no longer identify with the &quot;self&#39; of the surrounding tissue and thus go into their own, ancient, pre-eukaryotic (reduced) self survival mode and attack the host body. Also the research by Manolis Kellis in this area is very interesting.<br><br>Just like memories are important to the survival, notion of self, they are also important to the notion of free will. Try to think if you can have free will without your memories.
At this moment in time I don&#39;t think that the &#39;experts&#39; really understand what they are doing.
&quot;Biological mechanisms&quot;; &quot;memory storage&quot; etc. all belong to the jargon of engineering. It seems as though biologists try to reverse engineer biological systems, assuming that ultimately they are just machines - a machine being any system whose state evolves according to some rule, possibly probabilistic; those things we humans are so good at making. However, in modern physics, where general covariance plays an indispensable role, there is no universal `evolution parameter&#39;, or time. Machines are therefore not native to our world, and a broader class of systems - non-machines? - should be considered. The phenomenon of memory in non-machines does not (necessarily) involve storage of information; empirically, memory is just an affinity between the behavior of a system at two distinct segments of its (extended) world-line. This even opens the possibility for `future memory&#39;...
One of the best discussions ! <br>Cristiana Alberini thank you for your contribution to science üëå<br>ONLY ONE COMMENT: <br>The fake applause (audio) used during Editing does not bring any extra value to the discussion.
Love your content! ‚ù§
These experts seem not to be aware that simple water has memory. I won&#39;t be surprised if individual electrons or photons have memory.
For Brian: In search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust is a classic novel on memory
Thanks, I tried searching for the title but it seems it comes in five volumes !?!
Everyone three cheers for Brian Green, hip hip?  Hip hip?  Hip hip?
In a world where we are constantly stimulated to move on to the &quot;next thing&quot; (whatever that may be), this interview shows us how this interferes with our ability to learn, which is intrinsically linked to the ability to form lasting memories. We really need to slow down.
Right?? Wonder why the school system does not spread academic subjects like chemistry, mathematics, and physics over the week? Now days confused students come to class super confused without at least one day break from learning..<br>Let‚Äôs schedule math on Monday and Thursday and chemistry on Tue and Friday.. you get the idea!!
Ah they discovered how it happens but forgot due to chemical exposure? Years later ...
You&#39;ve got to be careful in those labs. Don&#39;t say you don&#39;t remember.
Dead end
When the video started, I had a Deja-vu.
Same Realm
Every memory is concurred with action , if you just read and don‚Äôt write that memory just evaporate out of your storage , like a words out of your mouth, without any thoughts. You can read human mind by their actions of their words. Science are concurred with experiments and of course most with results of experiments.
Epigenetics at work !! Memory recall = opening  up neurotransmitter channels for easier transmission/reception of nerve impulses.
In my opinion, the memory may be created by most critical things as:<br><br>Pay attention.<br>Trying.<br>Love to trying.<br><br>However, any condition may able to change those things in my opinion, like aging condition‚Ä¶<br><br>A football fan and a soccer fan always are talking and have a good understanding about their own favorite sport.
A lot of jumping apes!<br>Planet of apes is full of chaos!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYZnoe4ZNv4&amp;t=1170">19:30</a> that‚Äôs incorrect because they can‚Äôt differentiate between self concept and personal identity, even though personal identity is a kind of simulation of self concept but they are not the same regarding memory, but they share memory, for instance during dreams self concept uses short term memory too, but humans recognise dreams through consciousness type two (that‚Äôs why humans can remember some dreams).<br>During dream you use consciousness type two mot type one that you uses right now, it‚Äôs different but that‚Äôs why its name is consciousness type two ,‚Ä¶.etc
Humans can generate long term memory from first time too in specific situations.<br>Not only that! Many humans those who had heart transplant acquired long term memory!<br>they can‚Äôt understand the real differences between short and long term memories!<br>Long term memory is direct part of self concept itself while short term memory is shared.
Many people who are exposed the traumas, physically, psychological, drug addictions become apart of the spiritual realm. This is quantum entanglement.  When a person passes and part of the vessel is separated  the electric current when joined can have a particular or particular memory or feelings sensation.  Energy exist it can never be destroyed.  But when not in a vessel to contain the while energy . Which is the heart and the brain molecules separate so do energy that can&#39;t be seen with the human eye. Aka the void.
I, again, so naively ask.... Why Mr. Beast video has more views than this one.

I&#39;m devastated how our current Study and work culture or for general lifestyle for that matter, has completely disregarded the importance of Sleep.
Sleep is great to heal rge mind. But sometimes stressing the mind in away of over thinking almost daizing off like falling asleep into like a meditative mind helps us become clever<br> But daily meditation can do this without the negative effects
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYZnoe4ZNv4&amp;t=600">10:00</a> Regarding how much insects can process and remember, their current approach will never work!<br>For instance they can‚Äôt imagine the amount of memory that Mosquito can hold and process, let har watch insects carefully, they rely on processing huge amount of information (high level related to memory)!<br>Molecular approach can‚Äôt help them to figure out how memory works.
It‚Äôs possible to try to understand how so-called working memory works within the current limited accumulated scientific knowledge but it‚Äôs impossible to understand the process of how temporary memory becomes permanent or the relationship between both of them, that has to do with Limbic system which works similar to processing unit that includes memory, Limbic systems is far more complicated than they can imagine, Limbic system will keep impressing scientists even after thousands of years to come (no exaggeration at all).
Well actually it&#39;s imprinting of the brain and memories..Feeling they say don&#39;t matter but they do.  Negative let&#39;s say energy or person situations cause trauma. Stress causes cortisol release of negative feeling sometimes then we have negative effects of not bring acceptance. Neuroplasisty is the change also of the brain functions and changing the way our body processes stress and feeling. Changing memories we convert.
So positive vibrations are needed self worth self confidence changing your mind from the victimized state to the state of mind that you chose this life and you take and learn and become curious and you study to learn. Thus is nor only boost of confidence but changing the chemistry of the brain and the body.  It&#39;s hard work I think j I. Proof of this
In the field of Physics, they tend to not run into the problem of ethical concerns of human trials ... so fruit fly&#39;s, and other species are just what we were mainly bound with. There hasn&#39;t been a full on scale of human trials since the Holocaust, so that has been a major problem (especially since we can still find out our system tends to vary more than we thought previously ... between species). Our work, as in all other fields, has our obstacles which burden us on our adventures (some more so their own brains limitation on understanding the world through our Phaneron).
We don&#39;t need a holocaust.  Due to the science discovery and doctors, scientists, trials,fda , free samples, pharmaceutical, social security  numbers internet , quantum physics every thing in this world is what life is about. Literally!
The black ball at the center of the Earth also has memories, including biological genes.After complex calculations, the black ball uses atomic manipulation mechanisms to create biological stem cells. These stem cells are bigger than amoebas.üé±üíªüíæü¶†ü¶ñ

So why would you turn the liver off to secrete insulin
I see new reconfigure of insulin
I see massive recalls in new insulins!!!!
So is this woman realize what&#39;s going on??
Lol because as infants and children were growing up seeing things aren&#39;t there is because adults don&#39;t see it. You all taught kids it was bad
Did you all know this the dam insulin makers
Invetro as well what a shame
So you all caused autism and learning disabilities? When did that first arrive?? With new insulin?? Hmm
What did it do to the DNA of my son that has breast like tissue!! You all fucked up his DNA!!! Some bullshit sorry just got that down load
What about the 3 pregnancy that I lost on this dam insulin
Arianna&#39;s 2nd career?
Yq because your starving the brain!! And feeding it CO2!!! I&#39;m not a scientist and I have figured this out!!
No it&#39;s from th loss of sugar and protein and causes foggy brain your causing brain difficulties
Dice... Don&#39;t forget circumstances events?
So what other medications are starving the brain of sugar???
Gastroparesis and it goes after the vagal nerve!!!!!!
What about the gastroparesis it causes.. the ilius that stoos
Ser people I ain&#39;t lying
Bullshit!! What about the increased co2
Lol what about it taking the sugar out of the brain
Lol here we go!!!!!!
This is nutz.. who eles has to have brain damage and death? Who else has to watch their loved ones starve to death

How many more people must suffer ?
Increased diabetes or bad insulin makers that won&#39;t take responsibility
8 billion people with diabetes
Actually, 8 billion people is the total amount of people on the planet. Are you sure?
Your correct! 8 million.  I eas spread typing on a phone listening and blowing my own mind that I told her what she was going to say before she even said it. Making me prove my point.  That if I can find there flaws without college , why. Because I&#39;m getting messages from above.
So why isn&#39;t the insulin makers making this Public?
Not if your insulin
protein in th brain is taken out and the insulin stops the liver from making sugar starving the brain
All diabetic maker blaming drug reps and just the samples
Then fresh insulin gets out in and bottoms out
Did you know insulin kept below 32 degrees causes insulin not to work? And insulin above 86 degrees stops working then if you wear an insulin pump outside for over this time you need more insulin the insulin goes bad the doctors adjust it.
Insulin is a hormone and removing sugar from the brain causes gastroparesis. Peristalsis stop methane builds in the system causing too much CO2 causing anesthesia type effects
Oh ya Bruce Willis has asphasia from diabetes and pulling sugar off brain and possibly can be reversed with protein and sugar in the brain it was just released in Feb 2023
